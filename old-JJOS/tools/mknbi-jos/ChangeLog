	* IP address support gets only compiled in if the proper header
	  files exist

Sun Jun 15 23:21:36 MEST 1997  Gero Kuhlmann  <gero@gkminix.han.de>

	* Fixed a bug which allowed not giving the kernel and outfile names

Fri Jun 13 01:41:57 MEST 1997  Gero Kuhlmann  <gero@gkminix.han.de>

	* Added support for non-Intel architectures

Mon Apr 14 19:14:35 MEST 1997  Gero Kuhlmann  <gero@gkminix.han.de>

	* Recycled the version number to the main version number of the
	  whole netboot package

Mon Mar 10 00:50:58 MET 1997  Gero Kuhlmann  <gero@gkminix.han.de>

	* Added some more debugging messages to first.S

Sat Jan 25 11:54:01 MET 1997  Gero Kuhlmann  <gero@gkminix.han.de>

	* Cleaned up Markus code

	* Raised version number up to 1.6

Sat Jan 18 00:50:00 1996  Markus Gutschke  <gutschk@math.uni-muenster.de>

	* Fixed the code for determining the maximum size available for
	the BOOTP record.

	* New support for extracting command line parameters from the
	vendor tags.

Sun Jan  5 20:25:33 MET 1997  Gero Kuhlmann  <gero@gkminix.han.de>

	* Changed Makefile.in to support compilation without master makefile,
	and to work with the bin86 from the ELKS project

	* Removed writing boot image to stdout, because it's not possible
	to seek on character devices

Thu Dec 26 21:56:41 MET 1996  Gero Kuhlmann  <gero@gkminix.han.de>

	* Fixed a problem with loading a ramdisk image at a fixed
	location per Markus Gutschke's suggestion.

Sun Oct 20 13:45:07 MET DST 1996  Gero Kuhlmann  <gero@gkminix.han.de>

	* Added support for choosing the root device if not NFS to -d
	option.

Sun Oct 13 13:11:00 MET DST 1996  Gero Kuhlmann  <gero@gkminix.han.de>

	* Added "ram" pseudo directory name to -d option, so that the
	kernel can boot from a ramdisk without using init_rd.

	* The configuration now uses GNU's autoconf, so all files
	include a main config.h file, and the Makefile had to be
	changed and is now renamed to Makefile.in

	* Added support for different byte orders. It should now be
	possible to compile and run mknbi-linux on any UNIX style
	operating system. However, I don't have the means of testing
	this.

	* Raised the version number to 1.5

Mon Sep 23 15:01:59 MET DST 1996  Gero Kuhlmann  <gero@gkminix.han.de>

	* Changed the name of the program from mknbi to mknbi-linux in
	order to allow this program to coexist with similar programs
	for other operating systems. Also changed the Makefile so that
	everything is installed correctly. The mknbi.h header file is
	now identified by _MKNBI_H_LINUX_ to prevent inclusion of a
	wrong one.

Thu May 23 13:01:55 1996  Markus Gutschke  <gutschk@math.uni-muenster.de>

	* Reformated ChangeLog file so that it can automatically be
	maintained by Emacs; this required changing the filename from
	Changelog to ChangeLog.

	* Apparently, Gero missed some of my most recent patches. So, I
	retrofitted them into his code:
	  - Compile-time option ASM_FREEZE_AFTER_INIT.
	  - Different levels of verbosity in mknbi.c.
	  - Alignment to 4kB boundaries when loading ramdisk image.
	  - Check magic number in kernel image.
	  - Miscellaneous changes to the manual page (filename changed
	    from mknbi.8 to mknbi.man).

	* Added the new compile-time option ASM_DEBUG_VERBOSE.
	
	* Added autodection of big kernels. This obsoletes the option
	"-b".

	* Clean the command line from multiple or contradictory
	parameters. This is useful for configurations that use /linuxrc
	for setting up the environment.

	* first.S would not compile with full debugging information
	enabled. Added a few more jump instructions to fix this problem.

	* While updating the error handling in first.S, Gero introduced a
	bug that made relocating the ramdisk image impossible. Fixed by
	reloading "si".

	* Added support for the "vga=" command line option.
	
	* Updated the manual page.

	* Raised the version number to 1.4.

Thu May 16 10:07:38 MET DST 1996  Gero Kuhlmann  <gero@gkminix.han.de>

	* Code cleanup
	
	* Changed assembler code back to native 16-bit 80x86 opcodes
	
	* Fixed a couple of stack problems in the assembler code
	introduced with initrd support
	
 	* Changed to allow compilation of mknbi on UNIX systems other than
	Linux

Sun Mar 24 23:13:36 MET 1996  Markus Gutschke  <gutschk@math.uni-muenster.de>

	* Merged my source code with Gero's most recent source tree;
	basically this required adding:
          - new command line options: "-s", "-x"
          - minor clean ups
          - adding "hostname" to "-i" command line option
          - updating manual page
        I hope, I found all changes that Gero made after releasing the
	last public version.
	
	* Added new compile-time option ASM_FREEZE_AFTER_INIT to first.S
	and Makefile.

	* Added new command line option "-v".

	* Added second verbosity level to mknbi.c (this will output
	detailed load record information).

	* This release is now known as: Version 1.2 <Sun Mar 24 23:13:36
	MET 1996>

	* Updated manual page and ordered options alphabetically.

March 23nd 1996, Markus Gutschke <gutschk@math.uni-muenster.de>

	* Pim reported that ramdisk images have to be aligned to 4kB page
	boundaries; applied fix to first.S and mknbi.c.

March 22nd 1996, Markus Gutschke <gutschk@math.uni-muenster.de>

	* Changed the internal data structure for creating the load
	map. This allows for adding vendor specific data to the load
	records.

	* Added "auto" support for location of ramdisk image and made it
	the default behavior.

	* Added vendor specific flag to end of ramdisk load record; this
	flag tells about the desired load mode (auto|eom|<address>)

	* Reordered indexes of load records to fit the new algorithm.

	* Cleaned up assembly code -- at least a little bit :-)

	* Updated manual page mknbi.8.	

March 21st 1996, Markus Gutschke <gutschk@math.uni-muenster.de>

	* Added support for loading kernel into high memory.

	* Added "-b" and "-l" command line options.

	* Ramdisk images can now be loaded either to end of memory or at a
	user supplied position.

	* Determine size of kernel's setup code by looking into the boot
	sector.

	* Verify magic number in boot sector before accepting a kernel
	image.

	* Changed ID for type_of_bootloader to 0x41 as the old value
	collided with Peter Anvin's SYSLINUX.

	* Initialized heap pointer for kernel's setup code.

	* Allocated 8kB for kernel's setup code.

	* Disabled extra debugging messages in first.S.

	* Updated manual page mknbi.8.

March 20th 1996, Markus Gutschke <gutschk@math.uni-muenster.de>

	* Added support for preloading of ramdisk images to mknbi.c,
	first.S and mknbi.8.

	* Verified kernel's setup magic in first.S.

	* Allocated ID 0x31 for type_of_bootloader.

	* Ramdisk images will always be loaded to end of memory as
	reported by "int 0x15".

	* Removed extra block of junk that mknbi added to end of image.
