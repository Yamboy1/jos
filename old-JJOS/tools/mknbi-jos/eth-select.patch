Well, there is a provision by giving the device to use (e.g. "eth0" or
"eth1") at the end of the IP address string with the nfsaddrs parameter.
It's just that mknbi-linux is unable to handle this situation as of yet.
I patched it so that it's now possible to use the optional new bootp
tag 130 to specify the network interface to use for NFS-mounting the
root dir, e.g. write into bootptab something like:  T130="eth1"

To apply this patch, simply copy the file below into the directory
netboot/mknbi-linux and recompile. The source code for this patch
will appear in the next netboot release.
