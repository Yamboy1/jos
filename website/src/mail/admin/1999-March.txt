Subject: [JOS-Admin] New lists are on-line.

Thanks to Helmut and company, our new
list server is on line.  I've added you
all to the Admin list.

If you are one of the administators below,
please go to your list and fill in the
details about your list!  The passwords
for all of the lists (save the announce 
list) is 'frogsrus'.  Please change
your password.  *smile*

List       | Administator

announce   | Markus Peter <warpi@spin.de> and

----------------------------------------

Markus, I assume you will be doing the
migrating?  Afterwords could you
let everyone know on the 'general' list?

Robert, When you are ready (days, weeks,
months) this is one of the things we can 
add to the JOS announcement.  But I don't
think this is important to announce, right?

The only thing I have done so far is make 'announce'
moderated, and added JOS- to the front of the list
abbreviations.  If someone should sent mail to 
"jos-list@jos.org" instead of "list@jos.org" it
_should_ work, but I'd rather not advertise the feature.

Any questions or comments, let me know!

:) Clark

To the best of my understanding, we are waiting on Markus

Hi,

I tried to download the src to WikiClone from the links on the jos website

Is this intentional and if so is there any way I can get the WikiClone src?

No.  When we moved servers a few months back, I guess the 
public-ftp was never installed. It's not pretty, but I put
those files at:

It is my interpretation that the purpose of the 'general' 
list was to be the home for discussions which cannot go 
on any other list.  Thus, I was seeing more of an inheritance
mechanism, where if you can't find a more specalized class,
you post to the base class.  The notation was chosen to 
reflect that conceptualization.   I'm not married to
this ideal though, and the other way of thinking about
it seems perfectly reasonable to me.  

Robert, since you are one of the bulk contributors, I see
it as your decision, above is just an explanation of why
I did it the way I did.  To change it would take less than
30 seconds...  *smile*

Do you want me to change it?

I propose making the site pretty standard.  Say a top banner (graphic), 
navigation bar of links or buttons on the left, with a main page part with 
content for that part of the site.  For compatibility, no frames, use 
nested tables for layout.  For the home page, the main contet would be 
a short description of what is JOS, short blurbs on each major section 
of the website, and then a list of the 5-10 most recent news items in the 
"news database".

Major sections (with "wt" for web team maintained content, "wiki" for 
wiki based centent):

JOS Organization
=============
Our Goal (wt - static)
What is JOS (wt - static)
Who are we (wt - static with link to member lists)
Getting Involved (wt - static with link to member lists)
News (wt - dynamic, database)

Products
==========
Getting Started (wt - static)
JOS (wt - static with dynamic links to JOS binaries/source and mirrors)
Applications (wt - dynamic, database with dynamic links to 
	JOS binaries/source repositories and mirrors)
Utilities (wt - dynamic, database with dynamic links to 
	JOS binaries/source repositories and mirrors)

Development
==========
Getting Started (wt - static)
Roadmap (wt - static, maintained monthly/quarterly/whatever;  This is a 
	vision and timeline for future project start/stop times)
Projects (wt - dynamic, database with links to wiki)
Status (wt - dynamic, database)
Tools (wt - dynamic, database with links to wiki)

Documentation
===========
Getting Started (wt - static)
Supported Hardware (wt - dynamic, database)
JOS Handbook (wt - dynamic, database; have a look at php's annotated 
	manual)
Tutorials (wt - static links to tutorials)
Books (wt - static links to books)

Support
=======
Wiki Web (wt - static wiki intro pgae with link to wiki home)
Mailing Lists (wt - the mailing list manager page)
Newsgroups (wt - static list of appropriate newsgroups)
User Groups (wt - static list of appropriate user groups)
Web resources (wt - dynamic database list of web links (so we can auto 
	scan for dead links, keep updated, auto expire, etc)


I have the wt dealing with a lot of pages that are also present in the wiki 
because wiki is pretty weird when you first see it.  So the wt version is a 
more stable, static version of a wiki pgae (perhaps with a link to the 
appropriate wiki page).  Using a tool like Fusion or Front Page some 
one can throw the structure together in a few hours.  Just for speed 
sake, we could have people submit their content via email and have the 
web master(s) cut and paste it into the pages and get the site up and 
running in a day or two.  Then, we can start trimming out the automatic 
site generation of pages in tools, automate parts of the site as we have 
time, etc.  I know many people have issues with wysiwyg web site 
editors (I'm one of them) but this method works best for prototyping and 
getting sites published fast.  Then you can get feedback quickly, tweak, 
and refine using an html editor and start automating, adding scripts, etc. 
At least that's been my experience.

I have Fusion (www.netobjects.com) and could pop out a test site.

> What you need to do now is discuss the layout of the site, what you

Just because I'm familiar with it, I think MySQL and php would make a 
good server-side scripting environment.  I'm thinking of MySQL mainly to 
keep a "hot news"/announcements/"press release", project status, web 
links, etc database to make the management of that type of frequently 
changing content easier.  php (www.php.net) has proven to be an 
extremely easy to use scripting tool that's simple to pick up for people 
familiar with C (and therefore for people that are used to java).  

So we can use php to access the database, handle any forms we might 
put up, and add any dynamic content we might want.  The main 
advantage of php being that its free (and open sourced) and the scripts 
are embedded into the html documents (rather than having separate 
html and script files).  It has helped to keep the two (scripts and the 
associated html content) together in one file for maintenance purposes 
(at least for me, as pages and their scripts tend to get separated or 
differentially deleted/updated).
 
The web maintainers will need shell access and ftp access to the web 
server.  Appropriate software would need to be installed on the server 
(php, mysql, perl, etc).

I'm hip with Php3.  Markus likes MySQL, although I don't like 
supporting tools that arn't open source by using them.  I'd 
prefer using PostgreSQL if that's ok with you.  If not, MySQL it is.

You don't have to sell me on it. :) 
I have a box on the internet with Php3 and PostgreSQL running.  

However, I doubt that Helmut wants Php3 and PosgreSQL/MySQL running
on his box.  Even if he did, the installation and testing is a 
good 1/2 days work.  Ideally, Apache would have PHP3 module 
support compiled in.   Helmut?

I have a box "db.jos.org" (among other names) that could run the
Php3/PostgreSQL stuff.  www.jos.org, could stick with the static HTML, Perl/Python scripts.

Is this cool?

Subject: [JOS-Admin] SourceServer error message

Hi all!

I was just trying to upload a simple little utility for downloading source 
from the source server to the SourceServer when I got this message:

An error occurred during your form submission:

                           Could not mkdir 
/sites/jos/www/source/tmp/AveryRegier:
                           Permission denied

                           Press the back button on your browser to correct 
this error (if possible)
                           and resubmit the form. You can contact 
jos-apps@spin.de with any
                           questions regarding this error message.

It looks like recent changes to the server have not been kind to the source 
server!

By the way, here is the code for the handy little utility:

Actually I was thinking that the initial page for each section (who are 
we, etc) should be a semi-static statement.  A short paragraph or two to 
summarize who we represent and how te get specific info on who we 
actually are (member lists).  Same thing with getting involved.  So a 
static summary/launch page backed up with the database driven 
resources.  The only dynamic thing might be summaries of how many 
registered wiki names or members of the jos voting mailing list (is that 
how we define a member?) to show how large the jos project is.

Actually MySQL is open source.  It's not completely free (some uses 
require payment) but its use as a web database is covered under free 
uses.  However, I don't mind PostgreSQL.  Actually I don't care any way 
as long as its SQL and it has a php and perl driver.  :)

That would work.  I guess I'd still need ftp access (and hopefully shell 
access) to both boxes if we split it up that way.  I guess ideally I'd prefer 
to keep it on one box just for simplicity's sake so if Helmut has a db 
and php already setup on the www.jos.org box then lets do that.  If he 
doesn't we can save him some work by doing static stuff or www.jos.org 
and move the db/php stuff to your box.

Great.

Let's put the static pages on www.jos.org

I'd prefer PostgreSQL since I'm an active hacker with that tool.

> Helmut?

Helmut is the administrator for the jos.org site.  The site has
Perl and Python, it does not have MySQL, PostgreSQL or PHP3 at 
this moment.  Helmut, what are the chances of getting PostgreSQL
and PHP3 installed on jos.org?

I think that this is what we'll have to do.

Let's get you an account on both boxes.
