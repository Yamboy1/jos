<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; Who are we (wt - static with link to member lists)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Getting Involved (wt - static with link to member lists)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully the above two can be database 
</I>&gt;<i> driven as well. :)
</I>
Actually I was thinking that the initial page for each section (who are 
we, etc) should be a semi-static statement.  A short paragraph or two to 
summarize who we represent and how te get specific info on who we 
actually are (member lists).  Same thing with getting involved.  So a 
static summary/launch page backed up with the database driven 
resources.  The only dynamic thing might be summaries of how many 
registered wiki names or members of the jos voting mailing list (is that 
how we define a member?) to show how large the jos project is.

&gt;<i> &gt; I have Fusion (www.netobjects.com) and could pop out a test site.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok.
</I>
The only question is where to put it...
 
&gt;<i> I'm hip with Php3.  Markus likes MySQL, although I don't like 
</I>&gt;<i> supporting tools that arn't open source by using them.  I'd 
</I>&gt;<i> prefer using PostgreSQL if that's ok with you.  If not, MySQL it is.
</I>
Actually MySQL is open source.  It's not completely free (some uses 
require payment) but its use as a web database is covered under free 
uses.  However, I don't mind PostgreSQL.  Actually I don't care any way 
as long as its SQL and it has a php and perl driver.  :)

&gt;<i> However, I doubt that Helmut wants Php3 and PosgreSQL/MySQL running
</I>&gt;<i> on his box.  Even if he did, the installation and testing is a 
</I>&gt;<i> good 1/2 days work.  Ideally, Apache would have PHP3 module 
</I>&gt;<i> support compiled in.   Helmut?
</I>
Helmut?
 
&gt;<i> &gt; The web maintainers will need shell access and ftp access to the web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server.  Appropriate software would need to be installed on the server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (php, mysql, perl, etc).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a box &quot;db.jos.org&quot; (among other names) that could run the
</I>&gt;<i> Php3/PostgreSQL stuff.  www.jos.org, could stick with the static HTML, Perl/Python scripts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this cool?   
</I>
That would work.  I guess I'd still need ftp access (and hopefully shell 
access) to both boxes if we split it up that way.  I guess ideally I'd prefer 
to keep it on one box just for simplicity's sake so if Helmut has a db 
and php already setup on the www.jos.org box then lets do that.  If he 
doesn't we can save him some work by doing static stuff or www.jos.org 
and move the db/php stuff to your box.
