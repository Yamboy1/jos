This sounds good to me.

</I>&gt;<i> I have the wt dealing with a lot of pages that are also present in the wiki
</I>&gt;<i> because wiki is pretty weird when you first see it.  So the wt version is a
</I>&gt;<i> more stable, static version of a wiki pgae (perhaps with a link to the
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate wiki page).  Using a tool like Fusion or Front Page some
</I>&gt;<i> one can throw the structure together in a few hours.  Just for speed
</I>&gt;<i> sake, we could have people submit their content via email and have the
</I>&gt;<i> web master(s) cut and paste it into the pages and get the site up and
</I>&gt;<i> running in a day or two.  Then, we can start trimming out the automatic
</I>&gt;<i> site generation of pages in tools, automate parts of the site as we have
</I>&gt;<i> time, etc.  I know many people have issues with wysiwyg web site
</I>&gt;<i> editors (I'm one of them) but this method works best for prototyping and
</I>&gt;<i> getting sites published fast.  Then you can get feedback quickly, tweak,
</I>&gt;<i> and refine using an html editor and start automating, adding scripts, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> At least that's been my experience.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have Fusion (www.netobjects.com) and could pop out a test site.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Ok.

&gt;<i> &gt; What you need to do now is discuss the layout of the site, what you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need to do this, etc?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just because I'm familiar with it, I think MySQL and php would make a
</I>&gt;<i> good server-side scripting environment.  I'm thinking of MySQL mainly to
</I>&gt;<i> keep a &quot;hot news&quot;/announcements/&quot;press release&quot;, project status, web
</I>&gt;<i> links, etc database to make the management of that type of frequently
</I>&gt;<i> changing content easier.  php (www.php.net) has proven to be an
</I>&gt;<i> extremely easy to use scripting tool that's simple to pick up for people
</I>&gt;<i> familiar with C (and therefore for people that are used to java).
</I>
I'm hip with Php3.  Markus likes MySQL, although I don't like 
supporting tools that arn't open source by using them.  I'd 
prefer using PostgreSQL if that's ok with you.  If not, MySQL it is.

&gt;<i> So we can use php to access the database, handle any forms we might
</I>&gt;<i> put up, and add any dynamic content we might want.  The main
</I>&gt;<i> advantage of php being that its free (and open sourced) and the scripts
</I>&gt;<i> are embedded into the html documents (rather than having separate
</I>&gt;<i> html and script files).  It has helped to keep the two (scripts and the
</I>&gt;<i> associated html content) together in one file for maintenance purposes
</I>&gt;<i> (at least for me, as pages and their scripts tend to get separated or
</I>&gt;<i> differentially deleted/updated).
</I>
You don't have to sell me on it. :) 
I have a box on the internet with Php3 and PostgreSQL running.  

However, I doubt that Helmut wants Php3 and PosgreSQL/MySQL running
on his box.  Even if he did, the installation and testing is a 
good 1/2 days work.  Ideally, Apache would have PHP3 module 
support compiled in.   Helmut?

&gt;<i> The web maintainers will need shell access and ftp access to the web
</I>&gt;<i> server.  Appropriate software would need to be installed on the server
</I>&gt;<i> (php, mysql, perl, etc).
</I>
I have a box &quot;db.jos.org&quot; (among other names) that could run the
Php3/PostgreSQL stuff.  www.jos.org, could stick with the static HTML, Perl/Python scripts.

Is this cool?   

Clark
