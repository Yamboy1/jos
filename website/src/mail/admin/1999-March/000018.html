<PRE>I think this was/should have been sent to 
the 'admin' list. Sorry if this is not 
the case. :) Clark

&gt;<i> So what I would like to see you guy's working on it the new framework 
</I>&gt;<i> and look and feel of the jos web site.  The site will be the new main 
</I>&gt;<i> homepage for jos, it will be for people looking to find information 
</I>&gt;<i> about jos, what is it?, what's it's status?, contact information, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It should contain links all the different section, info, news, wiki, 
</I>&gt;<i> docs, download, etc.  Also you don't have to worry about writing 
</I>&gt;<i> content for any of these pages, that can be done by others.  What we 
</I>&gt;<i> need now is the framework at other can fill in.
</I>
I propose making the site pretty standard.  Say a top banner (graphic), 
navigation bar of links or buttons on the left, with a main page part with 
content for that part of the site.  For compatibility, no frames, use 
nested tables for layout.  For the home page, the main contet would be 
a short description of what is JOS, short blurbs on each major section 
of the website, and then a list of the 5-10 most recent news items in the 
&quot;news database&quot;.

Major sections (with &quot;wt&quot; for web team maintained content, &quot;wiki&quot; for 
wiki based centent):

JOS Organization
=============
Our Goal (wt - static)
What is JOS (wt - static)
Who are we (wt - static with link to member lists)
Getting Involved (wt - static with link to member lists)
News (wt - dynamic, database)

Products
==========
Getting Started (wt - static)
JOS (wt - static with dynamic links to JOS binaries/source and mirrors)
Applications (wt - dynamic, database with dynamic links to 
	JOS binaries/source repositories and mirrors)
Utilities (wt - dynamic, database with dynamic links to 
	JOS binaries/source repositories and mirrors)

Development
==========
Getting Started (wt - static)
Roadmap (wt - static, maintained monthly/quarterly/whatever;  This is a 
	vision and timeline for future project start/stop times)
Projects (wt - dynamic, database with links to wiki)
Status (wt - dynamic, database)
Tools (wt - dynamic, database with links to wiki)

Documentation
===========
Getting Started (wt - static)
Supported Hardware (wt - dynamic, database)
JOS Handbook (wt - dynamic, database; have a look at php's annotated 
	manual)
Tutorials (wt - static links to tutorials)
Books (wt - static links to books)

Support
=======
Wiki Web (wt - static wiki intro pgae with link to wiki home)
Mailing Lists (wt - the mailing list manager page)
Newsgroups (wt - static list of appropriate newsgroups)
User Groups (wt - static list of appropriate user groups)
Web resources (wt - dynamic database list of web links (so we can auto 
	scan for dead links, keep updated, auto expire, etc)


I have the wt dealing with a lot of pages that are also present in the wiki 
because wiki is pretty weird when you first see it.  So the wt version is a 
more stable, static version of a wiki pgae (perhaps with a link to the 
appropriate wiki page).  Using a tool like Fusion or Front Page some 
one can throw the structure together in a few hours.  Just for speed 
sake, we could have people submit their content via email and have the 
web master(s) cut and paste it into the pages and get the site up and 
running in a day or two.  Then, we can start trimming out the automatic 
site generation of pages in tools, automate parts of the site as we have 
time, etc.  I know many people have issues with wysiwyg web site 
editors (I'm one of them) but this method works best for prototyping and 
getting sites published fast.  Then you can get feedback quickly, tweak, 
and refine using an html editor and start automating, adding scripts, etc. 
At least that's been my experience.

I have Fusion (www.netobjects.com) and could pop out a test site.

&gt;<i> What you need to do now is discuss the layout of the site, what you 
</I>&gt;<i> need to do this, etc?
</I>
Just because I'm familiar with it, I think MySQL and php would make a 
good server-side scripting environment.  I'm thinking of MySQL mainly to 
keep a &quot;hot news&quot;/announcements/&quot;press release&quot;, project status, web 
links, etc database to make the management of that type of frequently 
changing content easier.  php (www.php.net) has proven to be an 
extremely easy to use scripting tool that's simple to pick up for people 
familiar with C (and therefore for people that are used to java).  

So we can use php to access the database, handle any forms we might 
put up, and add any dynamic content we might want.  The main 
advantage of php being that its free (and open sourced) and the scripts 
are embedded into the html documents (rather than having separate 
html and script files).  It has helped to keep the two (scripts and the 
associated html content) together in one file for maintenance purposes 
(at least for me, as pages and their scripts tend to get separated or 
differentially deleted/updated).
 
The web maintainers will need shell access and ftp access to the web 
server.  Appropriate software would need to be installed on the server 
(php, mysql, perl, etc).
