It is my interpretation that the purpose of the 'general' 
list was to be the home for discussions which cannot go 
on any other list.  Thus, I was seeing more of an inheritance
mechanism, where if you can't find a more specalized class,
you post to the base class.  The notation was chosen to 
reflect that conceptualization.   I'm not married to
this ideal though, and the other way of thinking about
it seems perfectly reasonable to me.  

Robert, since you are one of the bulk contributors, I see
it as your decision, above is just an explanation of why
I did it the way I did.  To change it would take less than
30 seconds...  *smile*

Do you want me to change it?
