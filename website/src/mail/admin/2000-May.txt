Subject: [JOS-Admin] machine aliasing (again)

to-do list:
	
	* Alias cvs.jos.org to cvs.jos.sourceforge.net.  cvs.jos.org is up
and steady at SourceForge; I'll be turning ACLs on for the whole CVS in
the next few days.

	* Alias lists.jos.org to jos.org, since people seem to be
expecting it.  Helmut's machine is running mailman beautifully, and he
doesn't seem to mind.  (BTW, is spin.de still sponsoring our mailing
lists, as we claim on our site?)  If his machine goes down, we can't do
redirects anyway, so it's not something we need to worry about.  If we
outgrow his machine, I imagine we could change the jos.org root DNS entry
:)

	* Alias ftp.jos.org to jos.sourceforge.net; even if we don't need
it, we may as well have an alias in place.  If it comes to that, we can
always just have it point people to the proper mirror
sites.  (e.g. cdrom.com)

	AFAIK, we don't have any active links to ftp.jos.org, so we don't
need to make any website changes once it goes active.  Once the CVS
redirect goes active, we will have to update the CVS links in the site to
use cvs.jos.org.  W.r.t. to lists.jos.org, just start using it :)  If
mailman doesn't automagically adjust to the new hostname/redirect,
changing it shouldn't be too hard.

	* Alias wiki.jos.org to jos.sourceforge.net, which will be running
sfWiki, once it's done.  It's currently running an alpha version that's
not up to replacing the wiki running at metamech.  
(http://jos.sourceforge.net/wiki.php3)  If won't be worth the trouble to
add this alias/redirect with this others if it just has to be redone,
don't bother.

Two status items:

	* planned backups: 

cvs.jos.org -- Clark's box.
wiki.jos.org -- Clark's box.
lists.jos.org -- none or Clark's box; see above
ftp.jos.org -- Clarks' box, or a mirror site, if it comes to that.
www.jos.org -- SourceForge.

All of these backups will require cron jobs running on Clark's box to keep
the backups up-to-date, but that shouldn't be a problem.  To-do list
w.r.t. to this is setting up his box.  I'll volunteer for this when I have
the time.  (Hopefully before June.)

	* www.jos.org is running fine as it as at Helmut's machine.  No
need for changes.

Yes.  Officially the announce list is still hosted at spin and all our 
archives from the original lists are there too.  However, I don't know 
who has post permissions to the announce list (I don't have 
permission) so I don't know if the list can even be used any more.  
I'd like to migrate the announce list to mailman on helmut's 
machine at some point so we can finish with spin (after grabbing 
the archives) and at least eliminate one inconsistency in our setup. 
Plus, I bet most people don't even know about the official announce 
list on spin because its separate from all the other lists...

Yes, sure.
I may have missed reading some of the mail from the JOS lists,
or thought that you were still discussing where to put what.

Once that has been decided, just tell me and we'll do the aliasing.

Nope.  And I've found that things get done faster (even if "wrong") 
by doing a proposed "something" and seeing if anyone protests.  
So I say unless anyone objects by say monday, we just move

This reminds me. I was looking at the issues with setting up ACLs within
CVS and I think it's not such a good idea to make the avail file
editable through CVS itself. I did figure out a way of preventing
certain users from ever being deleted, but the problem is that by making
it version controlled, anonymous users will be able to read the avail
file. This is a security hole because it gives crackers target accounts
to break into.

So, we need to make the avail file only editable via ssh, and only by
certain people.

	The problem is that we don't have ssh access to the box CVS is
running on; that's part of the reason it took so long to get ACLs working
at all -- the perl script, with correct permissions, had to be added to
the checkoutlist in order to show up on the server in a non-versioned
form.  The same for avail.  (I blew each of them once and had to wait
for the SF admins to fix it.)  It may be possible to rewrite the cvs_acls
script to use ssh and read avail from some non-public directory at
sfwiki.sourceforge.net, but then that account's username/passwd would be
in the cvs_acls file, which is /also/ in the anonymous CVS.  Similar
problems exist for any secured method, I think.

	I don't think, however, that having a list of usernames available
is that much of a concern to the SF admins; the list of developers
(e.g. those who can log into the cvs machine in the first place, with or
without a later ACL phase) is already public at

Subject: [JOS-Admin] [misconception] Why?

Why do so many people have the same misconception about JOS Wiki articles?
What are we doing that encourages this misconception? Time and time again,
I'm told that JOS Wiki articles are out-of-date. Time and time again, I'm
told that they are obsolete. This is a common misconception. Articles
written this week are hardly out-of-date and obsolete. This misconception
keeps coming back, regardless of the dates on articles and on our home page.

What more do people want? They might want to know up-front that the JOS
Project is an on-going research project. It is not a newspaper. It is not
an entertainment site. We are trying to find out more about Java
technologies. We are writing about the things we have discovered so far and
proposals to fix omissions and errors in the Java Virtual Machine
Specification.

Even some of our own members seem to hold these misconceptions. Some
members seem to be unaware of new articles. They are un-informed about the
content of articles and their relevance to the project. It is not easy for
a member to keep everything straight. How do we improve this?

We must start some kind of campaign to set the expectation of our readers.
First, the website is a research site. Articles are written in such a way
that they bring historical perspective. Most of them do not need updating.
Second, we must encourage members of the project to read the articles, too.

We do not have hundreds of people working on a website. I think our primary
mission is to build software that works, not a website. After we have the
software, the website will follow.

I thought we were doing better. Are we? More Wiki articles are
cross-referenced. The glossary is up-to-date. News is announced on our home
page.

I think a lot just has to do with the fact that changed pages are 
"hidden" behind the more static introductory pages that most 
people hit.  And they don't use the changes page to see the latest 
changes.  The solution is to move to some sort of auto-slashdot-ish 
summary of changes on the main page to really show how much 
turnover and edit traffic there is in the wiki.  Such statistics will also 
point to new information and "activity" in our wiki (quite a lot).  
Work is being done on this right now. 

If you're interested in working on this check it out in the sourceforge

http://sfwiki.sourceforge.net/

and join the project and start coding.  It's php/mysql based and 
headed up by our own -jQuinn

Subject: [JOS-Admin] [LGPL] Guidelines

We should help other members of the JOS project to protect their copyright
and distribute under a open source and free software license. There are
additional guidelines for publishing source code under the GPL and LGPL.
The LGPL enables a commercial vendor to redistribute your product without
an additional license. The GPL requires a commercial vendor to negotiate an
additional license, and possibly a license fee.

Without a copyright notice, your source code file (.java) becomes part of
the public domain. As public domain software, others can redistribute it
and redistribute a modified version, too. You lose control of the software
you write.

Keep your control with a copyright. If you want to put your source code
under a copyright, you must add a copyright notice to each source code
file. It should appear near the top of a file. A copyright notice along
with the words "all rights reserved" limits others from making any copies
without your permission.

On the other hand, adding a copyright and license paragraph enables others
to make copies because you have granted them permission through a license.

	While we should help other members with this issue, I'm not sure
that the (L)GPL ought to be the license of choice, especially as the
license JM released JJOS under ( and which I adopted for decaf ) may not
be compatible with them.  OTOH, I plan to use classpath or another class
library for decaf, which we will be redistributing under its license, so
some license fragementation is necessary, unless JM and I agree to
relicense our code.  I have not spent enough time reviewing better-known
licenses to see how well they match the JJOS license, so I'm not sure as
to which, if any, it may be switched.

	Authors have an implicit copyright to their work.  Your code
remains your code until you choose to make it otherwise.  (I'm assuming
we're using American law for now.)  It may be the opinion of the legal
system that by distributing your code in certain fashions, you have
implicitly entered it into the public domain, but it can not be the
general case that distributing a work without a copyright notice enters it
into the public domain.  Certainly, for instance, I retain rights to my
posts on slashdot, even without a copyright notice.  On the other hand, it
can't hurt to be careful.

LGPL is not my license of choice, either, but for a different reason. I
chose it because it is less restrictive than the GPL and that is
important when other applications will be directly linking to it.
However, as Transvirtual have pointed out with Kaffe, the GPL may be
just as effective in this case. If we define a JOS spec and there are a
number of implementations of it, one LGPL'd and one GPL'd, Java's
dynamic linking allows you to run your program against either of them
without change, so it cannot be said that you are violating the GPL just
because you happen to be running your program with a GPL'd kernel.

As for whether or not JJOS and decaf are incompatible with rheise.os
(which is part LGPL and part GPL), it is an irrelevant issue if we can
convince the courts that rheise.os is not a derivative work of decaf or
vice versa. I'll look into this.

> OTOH, I plan to use classpath or another class

With classpath, it's even less of an issue. Programs that use the
library do not need to be released under the same license. You just need
to make available the source code of the LGPL'd components you are using
under the LGPL.

This is the same for Australian copyright law (which I was just pointing
out to Gilbert in a private discussion). Your work is copyrighted as
soon as it comes into existence. Placing a copyright notice helps inform
people who the copyright owner is. However, placing an incorrect
copyright notice on your work invalidates the copyright (from
memory...).

	Issues like these need to be worried about, but I was mostly
thinking in more general terms, that the fewer licenses we distribute
under, the fewer potential problems there are.  *shrug*  I don't think
that rheise.os is a derivative of decaf -- considering that it doesn't use
any decaf code! -- and if you don't, I'd say we have a pretty good chance,
as the authors in question, of convincing the court of the same. :)

	I know -- I was just noting this to say that we'd have at /least/
two licenses in the JOS distribution, so worrying about differenent
licenses may be counter-productive.

As a consultant, I write source code for hire. When I create something for
myself, I own it. When I create something for my employer, it is owned by
my employer. A copyright notice makes it clear to everyone involved who
owns the copyright.

I write source code for my own private use. I write source code for
publication. A copyright notice makes it clear that I own the copyright. A
reference to a license makes it clear what copyrights are reserved and/or
granted.

A copyright holder must take appropriate action to protect a claim of
copyright. Publishing without copyright notice is a bad thing. Publishing a
work without copyright notice is inappropriate. It makes it far more
difficult to protect a claim of copyright. Publishing a work without
copyright notice, including the posting on an Internet website or mailing
list, puts a work in the public domain. If it is your intention to publish
a work and make a claim of copyright, a copyright notice is not optional.

-----

JOS Wiki pages have a copyright notice at the bottom for a good reason. The
notice enables a JOS Wiki author to protect their claim of copyright.

Someone should add the year 2000 to its copyright notice. Everything
written since 1 January 2000 is not protected by the copyright notice on
JOS Wiki.

Notes:

	Since we'll be moving the Wiki off metamech, we may as well save
ourselves the trouble of rewriting the links to use wiki.jos.org and just
do that as part of the import.

	ftp.jos.org will be useful for hosting the spin.de mail
archives.  (Which some one needs to go get.)  the jos.sourceforge.net
website needs to link to these and the archives at jos.org, as well.  It's
occured to me that it may be worthwhile to alias the jos.org lists to the
sourceforge lists, to get a list of our lists in the 'right place' on our
project webpage.  This will break the continuity of the archives, but
having a mailing-lists = 0 on the project is misleading.  We need to
investigate the announce list at spin -- who can post/admin, if anyone --
and if possible or necessary, move it sourceforge, so that we have at
least the announce list in a public place.  Also, announce won't have
continuity problems.  This ought to be discussed.

I'm going to second the notion of moving announce to sourceforge 
(its where the lists will eventuall migrate anyhow).  Then we can 
actually use it ... at least for quarterly reports which we should be
