<PRE>If you guys can convince me that servlets are still being used in the real
world outside of some schools, and that there is some real world benefit to
them, we will quite gladly enable them.

However, so far nobody has been able to show me any reason why we should
take them off the shelf where PHP3, PERL and MIVA sit.

If servlets can accomplish better and faster and easier what all our other
clients routinely do with XXSSI, I will be  _VERY_  interested. 

Anything that is better or faster or easier than what we currently use,
will be eagerly and quickly installed. 

I have explained to you yesterday in great detail how we use SSI  and Java
for using variables to produce dynamic content, and I showed you a simple
and straightforward and easy to understand example:


<A HREF="http://hicards.com">http://hicards.com</A>

Show me on THAT example, how that lady could do it better or faster or
easier with servlets, and you got me convinced. But simply saying that it's
not quite as bad as PERL, that's not good enough.

I WANT progress, so please convince me !
