<PRE>Iain,

I am an active servlet developer and I can certainly see your points for
general page development.  For that there are .jsp pages as an easier
alternative.

The main reason I want servlets on the site is that I want to replace the
PERL stuff, such as the source server and wiki, as you mentioned.  We should
somehow be able to integrate the source server and the CVS repository.
Downloading off of the source server is buggy and a pain (though I have
written a quick Java utility to take the pain out of it) and it would be
nice to make some changes to it.  The problem is that my Perl is extremely
rusty and the original authors of those tools either aren't working on JOS
anymore or are no longer making improvements.  There have been a couple of
starts at making a servlet wiki, but those have generally stopped due to
there not being a place to run them on the JOS site because it doesn't
support servlets.  Not having the ability on the site greatly decreases the
number of JOS participants who have the skills to help with site
development;  whereas if we have servlet support, most if not all JOS
participants have the skills necessary.

That and Todd's point. :)

Regards,
Avery J. Regier

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	While I don't particularly care -- having better things to do than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fiddle with pages (a.k.a. code) -- it would strike me as a trifle odd if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the website of a Java organization weren't to use servlets.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From my brief experimentation with servlets, I would argue that they 
</I>&gt;<i> belong in the realm of &quot;Web Application Software&quot;.  And for the same 
</I>&gt;<i> reason that you don't find that many dynamic sites being driven by C or 
</I>&gt;<i> lisp code, I don't feel that java is a great choice simply because there's
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> too much &quot;mental overhead&quot; in creating simple web sites driven by java.  
</I>&gt;<i> You actually have to design a program, code, compile, etc.  I know, boo 
</I>&gt;<i> hoo hoo.  But if you're familiar with the frequency of changes, updates, 
</I>&gt;<i> and complete rewrites on websites you'd know that any time saved is 
</I>&gt;<i> huge.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (IMHO) With servlets it's a lot of design and work to simply get the 5 
</I>&gt;<i> latest update announcements posted to the update database, formatting 
</I>&gt;<i> it into a table and spitting it out in html.  You have to worry about
</I>&gt;<i> getting 
</I>&gt;<i> the jdbc driver loaded and connected, then how you're going to get the 
</I>&gt;<i> html template for the page, parse it, insert the database content 
</I>&gt;<i> (formatted) into the page and stream the whole mess to the web server.  
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe worth the effort if you're doing a join across several disparate 
</I>&gt;<i> databases and trying to use xml metadata to connect everything...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With scripting tools like php, you are author the page, insert simple 
</I>&gt;<i> tags to indicate to php that you're going into php mode, insert the php 
</I>&gt;<i> code, and then close the tag.  So the html and code are in the same 
</I>&gt;<i> source.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think servlet have their place and that we should try and get them 
</I>&gt;<i> running on the site for other uses (maybe a wiki replacement, or for 
</I>&gt;<i> source control) but for the basic web site, its just not a very practical 
</I>&gt;<i> technology.
