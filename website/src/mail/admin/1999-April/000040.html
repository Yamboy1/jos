If the people writing the web site would like to use
servlets for the dynamic pages, they can do so at db.jos.org,
I can build mod_jserv in if required.

The only problem with servlets (besides memory and speed, which
are also problems with PHP3 and Perl, etc), is that JDBC dosn't
understand domain sockets, and thus, TCP/IP sockets must be
enabled on the database.  This makes things slightly less secure,
since there is one more port open for crackers.

On the plus side for java, is the gjc compiler that
cygnus is working on.  I hear the speedups are 2-10x
the interpreted code.  However, it'll be a _long_ time
before we see that available for servlets...

PHP3 has proven to be relatively efficient, when you use
it only for SSI, it's speed/time characteristics are 
almost identical to Apache's built in SSI (since PHP3 is
a compiled module).  When you start to use it for other
tasks, (which SSI/XSSI cannot do), then it is, of course,
slower.  But then, the alternative is a CGI call...

As for perl, perl_mod is loaded once, removing 
the hudge performance penalty that exists.  If 
Helmut was smart, he'd include mod_perl in his
apache compile and he'd see the wiki processes
go to the bottom of his list...
