Well, show me !
WE use Java, but so far all JOS is noticed for is for putting extremely
disproportionate loads on the server with archaic relics like PERL and
Python. Just look at TOP next time you go in with telnet. You don't see the
sites that use Java, SSI, XXSSI and SHTML to process a thousand dynamic
multimedia pages per hour lingering on TOP. Their processes just zip right
through. The only ones that are lingering are  your &quot;view&quot;, your &quot;python&quot;,
etc. 

I had hoped we would be learning from you,  that you would contribute
something new and better, or at the very least come up with a decent applet
now and then. 

If you can &quot;write any code that is required&quot;, SHOW me on that example I
mentioned:

Between all of you you should be able to come up with at least one tiny
little token improvement !


btw. The Cardmasters Spring World Championship has 
started and YOU are one of the judges who determines
who the new World Champion is. Your voting booth is at

So, check out the competitors and make your opinion count. Thanks for voting !
