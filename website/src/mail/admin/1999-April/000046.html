I don't think anybody else on that machine uses PERL any more.
There are a bunch of HTML based chats on that machine, 
but you never see them linger, neither at the top nor at the bottom.

Also, hanging Perl onto Apache won't make a bit of difference with Wiki. 

The program itself isn't really DOING anything that should account for a
detectable load. It's not doing serious graphics work or compiling big
stats,  -just minor messing with text and simple searches. Compared to all
the heavy stuff flying through, that SHOULD not show up at all, and above
all, light stuff like that should not linger in TOP.

Maybe when you port Wiki to Java or C,  you could try to find out what in
it hogs resources and doesn't release them. 


btw. The Cardmasters Spring World Championship has 
started and YOU are one of the judges who determines
