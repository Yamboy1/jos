You have a chance to learn from us.  You're not taking it.  There have been 
repeated requests for servlets by various people within the JOS project 
over the course of time.

Here are some of the reasons why you haven't been learning from us:
* PERL and Python are not the core competencies of the majority of JOS 
members.  By nature, Java is.  It is of no surprise to me that some of the 
tools we have built to support what we are trying to accomplish are poor 
performers.  There have only been a few people who knew those languages and 
technologies well enough to write those tools, and some of those people did 
not stay with the project or got too busy to support the tools and make 
improvements anymore.  We don't necessarily have people to take up the 
slack because the core competency of our members is Java.
* We haven't had much need for writing client side Java.  For those things 
which we do need (such as the Chat applet) they required server-side 
processes.  I don't know what the server portion of the Chat applet was 
written in, but it certainly didn't stay running for long.  There isn't 
much that people will be willing to do for the client-side Java piece if it 
can't be used anyways.  Instead we have reverted to tried and true IRC.

I work for an international, fortune 500 (at least) company and was the 
technical person who spearheaded bringing servlets into our computing 
environment and tested, recommended, implemented, and supported the servlet 
runner.  It took a little bleeding to get the bugs worked out, but that 
didn't take long.  Now the servlet applications we have are the most stable 
and well behaving on the whole.  They are fast because a new process does 
not have to be created for every hit like CGI.  Not only that but because 
of their architecture, the only cost to starting execution of a normal 
servlet hit is to create a new thread (depending on the servlet runner, 
some of them even pool the threads).  We have been amazed at how many 
applications we could fit onto one NT box.  (We had thought the limit of 
manageability would be about ten per box, but we have already tripled that 
with more to come.  The overhead on that box is not from the servlets, but 
from our choice to have each application (each of which can be a rather 
large number of servlets) in a seperate web server instance.  The web 
servers are taking up far more memory than the well-writtten servlets.)  If 
that can be done on a Windows machine, imagine what we can do on a Unix 
box!

Granted, we do have a very stable JIT compiler for our platform.  I don't 
know what the status is of JIT compilers for the platform JOS is on (I'm 
not even sure what that is.)  If there is no JIT compiler for the platform, 
then we may be better off just waiting to go the servlet route until there 
is a good one.  You can expect a 10X performance gain over plain 
interpreted.

Your apparent perception that servlets are not being used cannot be farther 
from the truth.   They are being used all over the place and far more than 
applets anymore.  It is kind of hard to see because they are all server 
side, and there are many ways of masking their tell-tale sign in the URL.

Servlets can and do have some drawbacks.  They are not good for everything, 
and a good deal of what it sounds like you do they are not likely better 
for.  There are, for instance, some problems with having to embed HTML in 
your servlet code.  There are ways around this obstacle such as creating 
reusable frameworks and tools for this purpose, such as many devlelopers 
have done at my company.  There are also technologies such as page 
compilation and JSP to help with that too.  However, the flexibility and 
performance you gain over other technologies makes that pain worthwhile for 
many a project.  Also, if you have a stupid developer, you can have memory 
problems with servlets, but that is just like any other technology.

If the JOS members are given the ability to develop the JOS site with the 
technology that is their core competency, you will quite likely start 
seeing some very interesting things come out of the project which will be 
of a help to you.  I wouldn't expect much too fast, because site 
development is not our primary focus.  Writing an operating system is.  We 
will write the tools that are necessary for us to better communicate to 
help us reach that goal.  If you decide that it isn't worh it, then we will 
make do with what we have.

We are appreciative of what you have contributed to us and the support you 
give us.  I'm going to try and get back to studying Todd's code now...

Thanks,
Avery J. Regier

Well, show me !
WE use Java, but so far all JOS is noticed for is for putting extremely
disproportionate loads on the server with archaic relics like PERL and
Python. Just look at TOP next time you go in with telnet. You don't see the
sites that use Java, SSI, XXSSI and SHTML to process a thousand dynamic
multimedia pages per hour lingering on TOP. Their processes just zip right
through. The only ones that are lingering are  your &quot;view&quot;, your &quot;python&quot;,
etc.

I had hoped we would be learning from you,  that you would contribute
something new and better, or at the very least come up with a decent applet
now and then.

If you can &quot;write any code that is required&quot;, SHOW me on that example I
mentioned:

<A HREF="http://hicards.com">http://hicards.com</A>
Between all of you you should be able to come up with at least one tiny
little token improvement !


btw. The Cardmasters Spring World Championship has
started and YOU are one of the judges who determines
who the new World Champion is. Your voting booth is at

<A HREF="http://cards.webby.com">http://cards.webby.com</A>
So, check out the competitors and make your opinion count. Thanks for 
voting !
