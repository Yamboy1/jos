<PRE>Just go to for example 

<A HREF="http://hicards.com">http://hicards.com</A>
and have a look how a simple, very basic database is 
used to serve pages either with a keyword search or 
by clicking on one of the 50 categories.

Both keyword search and category selection produce
scrollable result tables for final selection. By clicking 
on a selection you use SSI to pass variables that are 
then used to construct a page according to stored data.

Go ahead and try it !
On the constructed page,  called a &quot;Composition Page&quot;,
where you compose a postcard, you select some stuff 
and add text, addresses etc.
Choose the option to send the card later and see 
how that is done.

Then choose to send the card to 25 people, and see 
how you jump out to a detour page to collect another 
50 variables before going on to submit and generate 
and send the actual output.

Also note how all the pages are built with virtual 
includes for tops, headers, footers, etc., and how the
dynamic banners are linked into 2 or more accounting
databases.

Sure, it is probably a lot more involved than what you
need, but it is a very clean and simple example 
of using databases and SSI.

Btw., on that site you will also see Java in action.
Choose your horoscope, and it will scroll the current 
day's horoscope. If you send a card and it will be 
picked up for example next Tuesday, then it will
correctly display THAT day's correct horoscope, 
even though that horoscope is not even written 
yet when you send the card. 

How ? At run-time the Java text scroller simply 
looks in the horoscope bin what is there at that time,
formats the raw text for your browser and screen 
width and scrolls it.

So, send a few cards to your friends, and watch 
the process. You will probably get all kinds of 
useful ideas from it.
