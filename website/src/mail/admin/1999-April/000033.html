From my brief experimentation with servlets, I would argue that they 
belong in the realm of &quot;Web Application Software&quot;.  And for the same 
reason that you don't find that many dynamic sites being driven by C or 
lisp code, I don't feel that java is a great choice simply because there's 
too much &quot;mental overhead&quot; in creating simple web sites driven by java.  
You actually have to design a program, code, compile, etc.  I know, boo 
hoo hoo.  But if you're familiar with the frequency of changes, updates, 
and complete rewrites on websites you'd know that any time saved is 
huge.

(IMHO) With servlets it's a lot of design and work to simply get the 5 
latest update announcements posted to the update database, formatting 
it into a table and spitting it out in html.  You have to worry about getting 
the jdbc driver loaded and connected, then how you're going to get the 
html template for the page, parse it, insert the database content 
(formatted) into the page and stream the whole mess to the web server.  
Maybe worth the effort if you're doing a join across several disparate 
databases and trying to use xml metadata to connect everything...

With scripting tools like php, you are author the page, insert simple 
tags to indicate to php that you're going into php mode, insert the php 
code, and then close the tag.  So the html and code are in the same 
source.

I think servlet have their place and that we should try and get them 
running on the site for other uses (maybe a wiki replacement, or for 
source control) but for the basic web site, its just not a very practical 
technology.

Comments?
