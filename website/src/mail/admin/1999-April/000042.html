OK, before this gets too far into advocacy, I think we should just settle 
this for our particular situation.  Anyone that wants to continue the 
debate can take it offline.  For JOS:

www.jos.org
=========
Status: Will remain unchanged (Thank you's to Helmut and Webby)
Environment:  Perl, SSI, and HTML (remains same)

Static pages (with our without SSI), wiki, and the FTP/source server will 
live here.

db.jos.org
=========
Status: Our dynamic machine (Thank you's to Clark Evans)
Environment: Perl, SSI, HTML, PHP, PostgreSQL, Java Servlets

Dynamic pages, forms processing, cron jobs to auto-update 
www.jos.org, and xperimental wiki/ftp/source server projects that require 
Servlets can live here.

So if you're interested in trying to port wiki or the source server to java 
servlets/java clients, you can test installs and put up a beta site on 
db.jos.org.  If we decide to make a switch to a new servlet based 
system, Helmut can evaluate if the new java servlet based system shall 
be moved to www.jos.org.  It would be Helmut's decision because he 
must do the installation of servlet support, and its his machine that 
could potentially suffer from poor performance.

If he decides not to, we can either leave it on db.jos.org (if its ok with 
Clark) or find a new home for it.  Any disagreements with this?  Post it 
to the list so we can make a decision on this and move on.

-iain

btw - where would an email to <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@jos.org">webmaster@jos.org</A>, <A HREF="mailto:support@jos.org">support@jos.org</A>, 
etc go right now?  I was thinking that those would be nice email 
addresses to put in certain places on the new web site... :)
