I guess I should tell you guys that I have left the project. I have
handed the arch@jos.org administration role over to _Quinn who I'm sure
will handle things as smoothly as possible (if there are any objections,
Clark is able to override any changes I've made).

Before I completely vanish, I would also like to give some advice to the
project. There are many ways to design a Java Operating System, and in
many cases it is difficult to determine if one way is better than
another. In reality there are probably several designs that are just as
good as one another, but reality is unknowable. Because of the nature of
reality, it would seem pointless to argue over alternate designs if both
designs have potential. It would be more productive to split JOS up into
separate research groups and see how far people can get with each idea.
When you put all these people together in a single mailing list,
constant disagreements prevent any work from being done.

The reason I have left the project is so that I can continue research in
various areas without having to justify "why". I will continue to work
on rheise.os, a Java layer for a Java operating system, and experiment
with various types of IPC such as direct object sharing and with various
process, security, user and file APIs. It should be obvious that I am
beyond accepting apologies for uncalled for remarks. I didn't join JOS
to be discouraged from writing a Java operating system. I would have
preferred criticism to come along with reasons. That said, I hope the
JOS project decides to run rheise.os over its kernel but I think it
would be best for me to work on rheise.os separately.

I am thankful to those who made JOS possible. I did benefit from my
experience on the project and I appreciate those who put in the
administrative effort and also those who contributed to the actual
development of JOS. But for now, I wish the project good luck.

Bye.

I'm sorry to hear you are leaving us.  You will be sorely missed.

I understand this problem.  The rote response is to suggest that 
you ignore the doubters or criticizers and continue coding the way 
you see fit.  Of course, its hard to do when you feel your ideas 
(especially highly experimental ones) are being attacked.  

If others feel the same as Ryan and are tempted to 'throw in the 
towel' please let us know.  I'd like to try and convince you to stay.

Ryan, I wish you the best on your future work and would be very 
grateful if, when rheise.os finds a new home, to let us JOS'ers 
know so we can keep up to date on your work and hopefully 
integrate it into JOS in the future.

rheise.os is being hosted by progsoc:

	http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/projects/rheise.os/

Any progress I make will be posted there. And thanks for your interest.
If JOS would like to use rheise.os, I have documented the JVM
enhancements that I will require. I am currently building those
enhancements into Kaffe so that I can run rheise.os as a stand-alone OS
on top of OSKit. I would be interested to see how well it runs on decaf
once a classpath or kaffelib is integrated into decaf.

Speaking of legal issues, I think it important that JOS stay as it is a
non-profit grassroots (un)orginization that is open to anybody. I think
any JOS corporation should act more as a gardener: help keep the ground
fertile (keep everyone motivated and the website/mailing-lists running),
making sure everything grows (polish abandoned code) and then every now
and then selling the fruit. A JOS corporation would basically be a
parasite on the JOS organization, it would take others effort and sell
it for its own profit; so it is important that this parasite be a
symbiot, that it give as much as it take. Also, if they're separate and
the JOS-corporation goes broke all JOS has to do is find a new web-host.

I don't know how big an organization would be required for something
like this, but I think we should try to keep it as small as possible and
let it grow at its own rate, otherwise it'll get top-heavy before it has
strong enough roots (I am mister metaphor today.) We are by no means
guaranteed success even if JOS is a success so it should be use to
running on low system resources (there I go again)

Very important, but if JOS.com and JOS.org (this seems an easier way to
differentiate them) are separate the deals and contracts would be with
JOS.com so if it goes under JOS.org wouldn't be pulled down with it. (of
course I know little about law)

That goes with company contracts like if RealPlayer made a RealPlayer
for Java they could pay us to put it on the JOS desktop distributions (I
believe that's how those things work, again I must confess ignorance)
which would work great for JOS.com and .org, since we'd be selling and
popularizing JOS at the same time.

That's why I think JOS.com shouldnt "own" JOS.org, JOS.com professionals
would have no more say then the average JOS hacker (in fact they'd have
less since they would have specific tasks to work on.) Ideally, (and
with any luck, practically) they would be two separate entities with two
different but mutually beneficial goals. There's no point in lying any
corporations only goal is to make money, and JOS.com would be no
different but how it did it would benifit JOS.org greatly and that's why
I think its a good idea.

While I don't disagree and am not strongly opposed to that, I think it
might not be the best way to handle it. I like the idea but I just think
we need JOS.com to act as proxy, to handle the legalities of these
deals. Maybe e-toolz would like to invest in JOS.com (again, ignorance
on my part.) I imagine e-toolz isn't the only company that could help us
like this, and Id hate to limit JOS (.com or .org.)

I applaud any company hiring programmers to work on an opensource
project that would benefit them, both from the standpoint of a
programmer who beliefs in open-source and free software and as a
strategist. And I'd encourage you to do that just as long as they
understand they hold no special office in JOS.org.

While I don't want to talk this thing into the ground, I do want to here
others opinions on these matters before anyone does anything (but still
talk to them; a possible relationship with a corporate entity willing to
further our goals is, of course, exciting.)

Cheers,

	Alright, stupid question time.  Why can't jos.com (a good name for
the moment) be a not-for-profit?  (e.g. the JOS Foundation)  It would
(should?) have the same legal standing as a corporation, and if it's
not-for-profit, we've removed the canonical motivation for corporate evil
-- if people are worried about it.  Are there limits on a NFP that would
inhibit the kind of actions we envision?  Another alternative to the
normal corporate structure would be a limited-liability partnership, but I

The first question should be about who will donate the time and the funds
for anything like that.
In 97 I tried raising awareness of JOS and money for JOS with a logo
contest and sale of tee shirts and caps. I spent quite a bit of time and
a money getting it all organized and the goods produced and ready.
The plan was that JOS members would start wearing them and that
friends and people around them would become aware of JOS and would
buy JOS tee shirts to show their support.

How many JOS members believed strongly enough in JOS to spend $10
on a JOS tee shirt or $12 on a JOS cap to get things started ?

Zero. (Except for me)

It does not look like anything has changed enough.
Who is going to play sugar daddy and will plunk down the cash to pay
for incorporation and pay some staff wages ?

If and when there is a sellable product, then the way to go is with JOS.org
members controlling JOS.com at arms length as directors and a paid
business manager running the day to day operation of JOS.com. Money
can then be funneled back to JOS.org easily and quite legally.

However, until there is a sellable product and at least a chance for
expenses to be paid, there is no point in discussing that.

Agreed.  JOS.org should always remain the common, point of contact for jos
developers.  An organization not a company.

In addition, a smaller company will put more focus on JOS and promoting
its long term goals than a larger company which may only have a short term
interest in the project.

Of course.  jos.org shouldn't make commercial deals or be interested in
making money.  Even as a non-profit organization, this is a danger
(becoming too commercialized) so I think the best strategy is to keep
jos.org as it is.  Very hard to make decisions which is good and bad.  Bad
because decisions are hard to make, but good because it can't make bad
decisions.

I don't think this would really work.  This structure us currently being
tried with well established open source projects like apache and perl and
I can see how the model may work for them.  But without a well established
and pervasive software package, it would seem wasteful and doomed to form
a company to support a product that doesn't exist.

Even if the company didn't do anything until JOS first comes out, you need
to pay taxes, do accounting, and handle other legal hassles just to exist.

Yup.  We plan to use it like we use linux (develop drivers, customize,
etc).  Further arrangements would need to be worked out (probably after
JOS is a shippable product.

"jos.com" is actually owned by tucows.com.  Perhaps we should use another
term to refer to commercial jos.

As far why not a JOS Foundation, once again, until you have something that
can make some money, the overhead of just existing would make this seem
like a really bad idea.  At least for now.

I don't think I ever thanked you for doing that.

Yeah.  I actually started the order process but I hate t-shirts with the
logo on the front.  I asked the dude if he could put it on the back (was
even willing to pay more for it) but it was not an option.  Sorry, I
didn't lend support.

I'm unsure if this type of thing will work before you have a product. 
After a product, sure, its pretty normal.  But before...

Well, this started off with Etoolz proposing possibly filling this role
depending on our future product plans.  This is not something we want to
do now, but something we're discussing over lunch as a possibility
probably next year.  One of our biggest concerns is how the jos community
would react to such a proposal.  Remember, we're a company (many people
immediately don't lik ethat) and we are motivated by making money (as
every company should be).

I completely agree.  the model only works if there is a sellable product. 
Until then, the only viable commercial involvement that makes sense, is
something like a "sponsor" or "sugar daddy" that has ulterior motives. 
Ours (Etoolz) would be to use the OS in various forms in our products (as
opposed to using an RTOS or linux).

For the "sugar daddy" model there are some rules too.
Nobody wants to deal with a bunch of disorganized anarchists except maybe 
to split one or two off the herd and exploit them individually.
A policy that has been agreed on at least a "till further notice" basis, 
should be top priority. While this could be a condensed version of the 
constitution, it should be nailed down, voted on and posted.

Second on the priority list should be a posted official contact list. Ian 
might be the obvious choice for that, however, he should be protected 
behind a volunteer that weeds out tech support and similar questions. If 
Ian is too busy, some spokesperson, not a decision maker, just a 
spokesperson, should be found to present one solid front. No matter how 
much arguing and debating is going on on the inside, the world should see 
only the results of that, and not have to wonder which member to listen to.

Third on the priority list should be a decision on what any funds or 
donations would be used for.

Fourth on the priority list should be a decision how funds are received and 
distributed.
"Is that check to be for Ms Jos Org,  or is that Mrs ?"
Yeah, right.

As long as I am not involved with point 3 and that is taken care of and 
nailed down,
I can take care of point 4 with the secure payment stations and carts on 
our servers. However, I would demand a total separation of point 3 and 4.

Once those 4 points are in place, that could be considered a major milestone.
