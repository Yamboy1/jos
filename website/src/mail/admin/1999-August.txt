Clark,

We seem to be having more problems with the Wiki web.  The 'Forbidden... '
message is coming up again for every wiki page.

Helmut changed the owner and attributes of the "wiki/view"
file and one or more other files so that they are not
accessable.  I think he would like the scripts checked for
infinite loops before the code is reactivated.

I'd like to point out that the vote for the Constitution has been scheduled
to start today.  I (as the vote caller) need certain information off of the
Wiki in order to call this vote.  The Constitution that we are voting on is
also on the Wiki.  I realize that we are on this server as guests, but I
need to make it known that the wiki downtime is a disruption to the
organization.  Having the wiki checked and turned on again quickly would be
much appreciated.

Thanks,

Exactly.
Something is badly screwed up with the wiki. 
We can not let something run wild and drive the server load to over 100 and
deny service to all the other users. 

Until you find what exactly has caused that and have fixed that in a way
that you can guarantee that it will never happen again, we can not allow a
possible repetition. 

It would probably be best to move the wiki to a PC with BSD or Linux.
Traffic on that is so minimal anyway that any old home PC would work for that.

Write to Victor 
vic@webby.com
he can tell you more about it.

Helmut, 

Could you point "wiki.jos.org" to 140.186.104.147
Also, could you move the DNS entries for kvisco.com, 
xslp.kvisco.com, www.kvisco.com to this box as well?

All,

Does anyone have time to setup the Wiki on a Linux 6.0 box?
Do you have ssh?  If so, tell me your telephone
and I'll call with the password for the "jos" user.

Subject: [JOS-Admin] Third day

Wiki is down for the third day. This has become a public relations nightmare.

The only thing we cannot do is say nothing. If we do nothing else, we
should change the JOS home page to explain this situation. We should be
forthright. We should let people know that it's going to be down for a
while. We should put a request for additional help and equipment on the
main page.

The vote is out. Since wiki has been unavailable during the critical first
days of the constitution vote, the vote should be postponed and rescheduled.

1. It is acceptable to lose service on a website. Most people will show
empathy and understanding.

2. It is not acceptable to keep silent about it.

Remember: There are parts of the JOS website that are still working. The
mailing list (mailman) still works. The www.jos.org/download page is still
working.

This also shows that our organization is unprepared for a crisis. We missed
an announce mailing list. Who will broadcast a message explaining the
situation?

Even if this technical problem is resolved today, it causes our
organization a lot of political problems. We may look unsophisticated and
foolish. We have worked hard to become more organized over the last two
years. Never give up. We've got to make this work.

Could permissions on files be the global wiki problem?

From my own website, I get this message when my httpd program does not have
permissions according to Linux. Since the httpd program cannot read a file,
I cannot read a file either.

What was the solution? I had to change the permissions on files in the
htdocs directory. If wiki is CGI, the httpd program must have execute
permissions on the CGI program. Without execute permission, all requests to
the CGI program return that "forbidden" message.

I imagine that the CGI program could have been uploaded/replaced on Sunday
night or Monday morning. Did someone forget to set the permissions of the
CGI program?

Unfortunately, there is no way to *prevent* someone from interactively
setting the wrong permissions. You can encourage people to set the right
permissions.

All of the pages in wiki seem to be inaccessable, except the changes page.

1. I think this is the time to put a crisis team together. I think the team
should "discuss" what it is doing on the admin mailing list, too.

2. I don't think this is the time to put wiki on a new machine. Is it
really that bad? Do we have this stuff backed up?

If we put out a new home page, it should have a link directly to the admin
mailing list where the crisis is being discussed.

One day is annoying.
Two days is a pain.
Three days is a crisis.

What do we know so far?

Here is the current situation with the wiki:

We are attempting to move the wiki to a new machine, which will have the URL
http://wiki.jos.org .
The wiki itself has been moved over, however the following things remain,
for which I will need the help of someone more intimately familiar with the
beast than I am.  (Iain?!!?!)
   * The wiki pages in RCS need moved over to the new machine.  There exist
6 MB (compressed) of wiki txt files, which I have a sneaking suspicion are
no longer used at all.
   * The wiki.jos.org DNS entry still needs to be set up. (I'm still getting
DNS errors when I try to access it)
   * An apache virtual server will need to be set up on the machine.  (Is
this already done, Clark?)
   * The wiki usernames and passwords will need to be transferred to the new
machine and security on the edit script set up in Apache.  (I am completely
at a loss on this one.)
   * HTML pages will have to have their links updated.
   * Something else I'm sure to be missing

I did what I could last night in the time that I had, however that time is
now up (I leave on a business trip tomorrow).  I can muddle through a
certain amount of it if I have time, but that would probably mean the wiki
would be down for weeks.  I don't think this is acceptable.  :)

Gilbert, 

You are exactly right, the wiki is not running because the execute
permissions on the view and search scripts have been taken away, and the
ownership of the script is now 'root'.  Helmut did this because the wiki
apparently was taking 100% of the CPU on a box that is shared with other web
sites.  He does not want to risk this happening again.  Therefore, in order
to get the wiki operational, we must move it to another box.

The critical things on the wiki as far as the vote is concerned are the
constitution and policy book that we are voting on.  I have thus copied
those particular files to:
http://www.jos.org/policybook.html  and http://www.jos.org/constitution.html

I'm comfortable continuing with the vote under the circumstances.

You should do more than just move a problem.
If a script is malfunctioning so badly that it runs a Spark20 with dual
processors and 256 MB of RAM up to a load of 107, just moving that
malfunction is not likely to help you. It will just repeat the malfunction
or attack-invitation at the new location.

I don't know if some member deliberately or accidentally tried to smoke a
server, or if a bug in Wiki put it into a loop that hogged processes
without releasing them. All we know is that Wiki drove the server load to
107, and when Wiki was CHMODed to READ-ONLY, the load instantly dropped to
below 1  (1= normal load).

As I mentioned to Clark a few days ago, until 
1) the CAUSE of that problem has been found, identified, 
and 
2) steps taken to guarantee that there won't be a repeat, 
we can not risk a repeat of that.

Just like we would lock the executables of any other site that was running
amok and preventing YOU from operating normally, the same thing applies to
JOS.

Helmut,

In order to do a log analyses, it would be helpful to know the exact (or at
least as close as you can get) date and times that the problem occurred.  I
find it interesting that you solved the immediate resource problem initially
by changing the permissions on the file.  If it were an infinite loop, such
a change would not have stopped the problem, because the process would
already be running in memory.  You would have to do a 'kill' to stop it in
that situation.  That the CHMOD fixed the problem says that the script was
being called repeatedly.  To my knowledge, no other scripts call the 'view'
and 'search' scripts.  If this is true, then it most likely was an outside
entity calling one of those scripts repeatedly, such as an ill-behaved
web-bot.  If this is the problem, then the best we could do is to make sure
the robots.txt file is up-to-date.  If a web-bot ignores that, there is
nothing that we can do.  Anyways, knowing the date and time will help us to
know if this is the case in short order.

Feel free to poke holes in my logic.  :)

Thanks,
Avery J. Regier

Helmut,

If you will tell me at what time all of this happenned, It might help us
figure out *what* happenned.  Thank you for the detail on exactly how you
went about stopping the problem.

The webbot doesn't have to be intentially malicious, just stupid.  It
doesn't take much code anymore for a person to create a simple web bot that
will open, say 20 or more threads each getting an URL over the network and
parsing to find more URL's.  If they don't bother to parse the robots.txt
file, there is nothing to stop them from doing that.  The wiki's 'view'
script essentially does nothing but parse a text file into HTML.  This takes
a bit of processing time for each request.  If a web bot was hitting the
wiki with that much concurrency, it is possible to run up processor
utilization that high.

I did a quick check yesterday of the jos-access.log file.  By day the number
of entries in the file were approximately:
01 Aug:   ~5000
02 Aug: ~15000
03 Aug   ~4000
04 Aug   ~3000

Did this problem occur on the second of august, machine time?  If so, it is
quite possible this problem was driven by outside hits to the wiki.  Again,
knowing the exact date and time when all of this happenned is the first step
towards ruling anything out.  If it was instead a loop in the wiki, I would
then be able to narrow down what wiki page may have started such a loop.

Regards,
Avery J. Regier

1. Helmut would like the Perl scripts off his
   server, as he does not think that perl is
   sutiable programming language for a production
   system.  This item is not up for debate, so
   let's not argue the point.

2. My ISP for my own server moved on the same 
   day as our Wiki failure.  This has caused 
   me no end to grief... he did not tell me
   he was moving, nor has he been good about
   getting it back on line with proper DNS
   entries... thus my time has been focused
   on saving paying customer sites... sorry.

3. My site is back on line now, but I gave
   helmut the wrong IP address, it is at
   140.186.104.247 *sigh*   Helmut is going
   to put a DNS entry for wiki.jos.org pointing
   to this box so that the perl scripts can
   be moved there.

4. A generic user "josdev" is available at 
    140.186.104.247 for those who want to 
   setup the wiki there.  Iain also has access
   to this box.  Unfortunately, the apache is
   virtual hosting... so Helmut's DNS entries
   are required for it to all work.

5. I really don't think there is a problem with
   the perl scripts... I just think it was a
   timing / load problem.  In any case, with
   the scripts more accessable on a Linux box,
   we can make that determination.

6. It would be cool for those who want access to
   140.186.104.247 to use ssh2 (its on port 9292,
   but I'm going to move this to the default port
   soon) as telnet access needs to be shut off 
   asap.

7. After tonight, I'm going to be going to Michigan
   and back to DC for a week... (I'm moving).  And 
   Iain is on vacation....  thus, neither of us
   will be good resources.    I'll be intermittendly
   on and off.

Late Sunday afternoon (4:00pm EDT), wiki was up and running. By Monday
morning (10:00am EDT), it displayed only a "forbidden" message. Thinking
that it was a temporary Internet glitch, I did not respond immediately.

Helmut should know when he changed the attribute of the CGI script. Helmut?

This matches your analysis that a web-bot found the link to a search page
or all pages link _and_ started worming its way through every page on wiki. 

>02 Aug: ~15000

15,000 requests is a *lot* of requests. All those requests are requests
from the outside, right? Those requests could not be performed from within
wiki. It could not have been a bug in our wiki script.

Helmut did the right thing, shutting down wiki the way he did. By changing
the attributes from execute to read-only, the wiki CGI script cannot be
executed. The web-bot started getting "forbidden" pages instead of pages
(with more links).

Helmut did the right thing, keeping wiki shut down until we understand what
happened. We are getting closer to understanding what happened, I think.
Has anyone checked to make certain that robots.txt is up-to-date? It should
have been updated concurrent with the search features. Otherwise, it was
just a matter of time before a web-bot got carried away with those search
pages.

And another thing. Because Helmut changed the attribute from execute to
read-only, we know it was probably not a run-away CGI script. A CGI program
that was already running would have kept on running even after the file
attribute was changed. Wiki doesn't need to use recursive calls to a CGI
script, like other websites do.

From the log, do we know where those request *came from*? I wouldn't be
surprised if 14,500 requests came from one IP address.

This may be an accidental "denial of service" attack. The HTTP server
should pose limit the number of requests coming from a single IP address.
Many sites limit requests from unknown IP addresses to 300 per hour, which
should not get in the way of human browsers. For known IP addresses, like
friendly web-bots, the limit varies based on time-of-day. This is a HTTP
service responsibility, neither CGI's or wiki's.

wiki went nuts on Monday that week, at 1:30-1:40 PM EST (machine time)
Permissions were changed then to restore normal operation to the rest of
the server.

No. A web-bot can not make cgi calls. A web bot only READS.

No matter whether it was a bug or accidental or malicious goofing around, 
the calls for your view and review scripts (or whatever they were, I can't
remember now)
were coming from inside wiki. 
I don't know whether they were generated BY wiki, or whether they were
allowed to enter the system THROUGH the wiki interface. All I know is that
the processor was called from wiki in a way that can not be tolerated.

Forget the web-bot theory. Web-bots read content directly, they don't put
on glasses and generate cute HTML pages, which would hide the meta stuff
that they are primarily interested in.

300 per hour ?????????????
Forget it. You can do that on your PC.

When we can use scripts to blast out a newsletter to 200 000 subscribers
without affecting the load, or generate a Million multimedia postcards in a
day with Java and pix and music and multiple text inclusions, then why
should we restrict normal operation to everybody because ONE client has a
flakey script or insecure access to their executables ?

Keep in mind that what we do with the cards networks is like a distributed
wiki with a few extra dimensions and on a much larger scale. 
Imagine 16 000 individual wiki sites all using a central engine and central
database that allows up to 999 simultaneous users.

The users compose files by choosing Java applets, pictures, music, text
inclusion files, and they add free-form text and HTML, and they fill out a
bunch of fields which are checked for syntax and validity. Then the
composed page is generated by pulling together all the specified components
and either further edited or "submitted". If submitted, a database entry is
made that will allow that page to be re-generated, then a password is
generated that has the date, time and origin encrypted into it and
retrieval info is sent to from one up to 25 people simultaneously, unless a
delayed notification is specified. If delayed notification is specified the
retrieval info is sent on that specified date. When a recipient clicks on
the retrieval link that has the password built in, he jumps directly to
that page which is then generated on the fly from the database entry. 

That generated page usually contains material which was not yet available
at the time the card was composed, for example the daily horoscope. If
"Aries" was specified when the card was created a month ago, only the
current Aries horoscope of the day on which the card is retrieved will be
scrolled into the page with a Java text scroller. 

If we can run SIXTEEN THOUSAND multimedia wikis simultaneously, some of
them with over 20 000 users per day,  without causing a load problem,
...........  then maybe it is time you guys used this occasion to do a
major overhaul on yours. 

Helmut

Ok, here is what I have been able to determine:
* A webbot has hit our site.  1200 of those >1400 hits on August 2nd are
from a single IP address.
* That IP address hit each wiki page.  It hit each page with the 'view',
'attach', 'edit', 'rdiff', and 'search' cgi scripts.  Why?  There are links
to each of those scripts in each 'view' of a wiki page.
* Of those five scripts, 'search' is extremely resource intensive.  The wiki
page which has a form for using the search script has a warning to this
effect.
* In the ten minutes from 13:30 to 13:40, ~55 searches were done.  That also
approximately how many were done in each ten minute increment in that hour
before that. That is one every 11 seconds.  Searching for my WikiName takes
40 seconds.  Thus, on average, there were 3 or 4 searches going on at all
times.
* Here is the current robots.txt file:
	User-agent: *
	Disallow: /wiki/edit/
	Disallow: /wiki/save/
	Disallow: /wiki/preview/
* These searches weren't the only thing being asked of the server.  The
searches only account for a small percentage of the hits on the jos.org
server from that IP.  While the server was trying to do all of those
searches, it was working on a bunch of less-intensive requests as well.
*  The errors log for JOS starts two hours after the problem was stopped by
Helmut.  Thus, I wasn't able to be sure exactly when the server restarts
occurred.  Any idea why the data is missing Helmut?  Is it archived
anywhere?

I agree with Helmut that the 'view' script shouldn't be a problem.  It isn't
doing anything processor intensive enough to cause those kinds of loads.
The searches, though, seem to be the problem.

Here is the solution I suggest:
* Everything but the 'search' script can be turned back on without danger of
problems or need for further discussion.  The 'search' script requires
further discussion.
* Add 
	Disallow: /wiki/search/ 
	Disallow: /wiki/rdiff/ 
			
	# Rover is a bad dog <http://www.roverbot.com>
	User-agent: Roverbot
	Disallow: /

to the robots.txt file.  Well-behaved webbots will not call the search
script.  The Rover stuff is from Yahoo's robots.txt.  We may want to add
some combinations of upper/lower case in the URL's to disallow.  IBM's
robots.txt does this.

The 'search' script is a valuable tool for us, and I hate to see it go away.
Here are a few things we can do to mitigate the risk of it being available
to be abused by search engines while still having it available for JOS
members to use:
* Short Term:  Remove the 'Search on this topic' link from the bottom of
every wiki page.  This way search engines won't have the URL's to do all of
these searches hand given to them, as was the case this time.
* Long Term:  Rewrite our searching such that it is pre-indexed.  If we had
access to a database we could add all possible WikiNames from the files into
the database, then when we do a search, we just do a SQL query instead of
parsing *every* wiki file for every search.  When a wiki edit is saved, that
page has its possible wiki links parsed into the database.

Hello,

A breif accusation of myself as being the one at fault for the wiki

Actually the way some of the wiki scripts are setup, a web-bot can make
cgi calls and not know it...  And the scripts will continue to work...

It is not up to date.  This is my fault.  I added the search script and
forgot to update the robots.txt file. Doh.  So its more than possible
that the entire meltdown was due to this, and it was completely my
forgetfulness at fault.  My apologies, esp. to Helmut for bringing down
your server.

> 300 per hour ?????????????
> Forget it. You can do that on your PC.

Yup.  And with the brain dead search being used by wiki right now, this
would be more than enough to bring the server to its knees.  I knew
that the search was an extremely dangerous feature to add because it
was such an enourmous hog but hoped that the benefits would outweigh
the costs and I'd have time to fix it before it became a problem. 
Looks like I was wrong.

Please do not blame Peter Thoeny.  Search was a feature I added with
the full knowledge that it could cause damage.  On his much smaller
wiki the solution is acceptable.  On ours, it is a weakness that I was
hoping we could live with until it could be patched.  I was wrong.  He
made sure I knew the risks so its all my fault.

> ...........  then maybe it is time you guys used
> this occasion to do a

Yes.  I'd would like to and the site needs it.  Unfortunately, I just
don't have the time to do it all at once.  So its patches here and
there as I have the time and energy.  Sorry but that's just the way it
is.

Helmut, please accept my apologies for causing you problems.  Is there
any way you can put our site on a box all by ourselves so that if our
site bogs down, it won't take anyone else with us?  Otherwise, I cannot
guarantee that wiki won't do this again to you (in its present or
future forms).  

If you can't (which is very understandable), since we are highly
reliant on wiki, it will probably be in everyone's best interest if we
moved our site to an isolated box somewhere if we can find one.  

If you can, or if you're willing to trust us, please turn on all the
scripts except for the wiki search script.  I believe that the search
script is the culprit and disabling it, should eliminate similar future
problems.  The other scripts should not be causing a problem and are
vital to the operation of our site.

In either case, please post your reply to the admin@jos.org list so we
know your position. 

Thank you.

Hi Ian
I am not familiar with the Wiki at all, but if it was set up so that a web
bot that is simply reading some of the ASCII parts of each file, triggers
executables, then that would have happened millions of times before, and
not suddenly started that day. I think you have to look a bit further.

I know, a good shoemaker goes barefoot, and we never have time for our own
tools until they break. However, something broke and just moving it to
another machine won't fix it.

Personally I think even replacing that old Perl search with a modern,
compiled searcher won't be a cure-all. That old search HAS worked OK until
the voting stuff was added. THAT''s the place where I would look for
missing brackets. 

What are the voting related scripts doing? Are they using the Wiki search
and leaving something open ? 

The only other times that I remember recurrent noticeable loads from JOS
they were Python related. They were not dangerously high, just nuisance
level. However, since that is definitely a weak spot, possibly a
combination of your voting scripts and whatever you do with Python drove
the quaint old searcher nuts. 

You have to look at what was new on that day. The web bots have cruised the
site hundreds of times every day since long before Wiki was added. There
was no change in that. If they WERE involved in the meltdown, then you have
to look at what could have suddenly, and for the first time on that day,
mis-interpreted their cataloguing as something else.

Re moving Wiki onto a different machine, I think that is either in progress
or has been completed. Clark would know the details about that.

Subject: [JOS-Admin] wiki.jos.org & some thoughts.

Well, Helmut has wonderfully put wiki.jos.org to point to a Linux box.
I think I made all of the necessary apache changes, so if anyone
would like to move over the wiki, this would be cool.  
In general /home/jos does not have much disk space, but
/cvs does.  So, puting the wikitext under, say /cvs/jos would
be great, regardless if CVS is actually used...

Which gives me an idea.  Instead of having the wiki pages dynamically
generated, perhaps we could do with a several stage approach:

1. A static snapshot of the pages is kept so perl is not used
   for view requests...
2. On update, the file being changed is automagically 
   made into a snapshot version.
3. For new pages, the WikiName of the page added to the 
   end of a newwikipages.txt file
4. Periodically (cron job?) this file is read, and all wiki
   pages are examined to see if they include this new link.
   If so, then they are refreshed during idle cycles.
5. Perhaps a manual way to invoke a refresh is given, but
   this requires a WikiName and password (just like a change)
   ... thus if you are editing 30 pages, you would wait till
   the end of the edits, and then click "update links" or
   something like that...

Thoughts?  This would dramatically reduce sever load since
perl is only used to modify the pages, and not dynamically
generate them all the time.

Best, Clark

Yes, something is broke, and we know exactly what it is.  The 'search'
script uses a brain-dead algorithm.  Even one search will search each and
every wiki file for every request.  This uses a fair amount of resources.
It takes 40 seconds to complete.  When a new search is done every 11
seconds, this will drive any server to its knees.  For now, we are
suggesting leaving this script turned off, while turning the safe scripts
back on.  We don't *need* to move them to another machine unless you refuse
to turn the safe scripts back on.

	What are the voting related scripts doing? Are they using the Wiki
search
	and leaving something open ? 

What we are talking about is eventually replacing the search with one that
does not parse every wiki page for every search, but rather does a simple
database call.  It has nothing to do with compilation.  It has *nothing* to
do with voting.  There are *no* voting scripts. period.  The only thing to
do with voting on the site are a few normal wiki pages and a mailing list,
which is working fine, just like all of the other mailing lists, and has
been working for several months.

	You have to look at what was new on that day. The web bots have
cruised the
	site hundreds of times every day since long before Wiki was added.
There

Yes, webbots have cruised the site before.  They did not have handy links to
the 'search' script before at the bottom of every wiki page.  Please re-read
my post from yesterday with my analyses of the problem.

	Re moving Wiki onto a different machine, I think that is either in
progress
	or has been completed. Clark would know the details about that.

Iain and I are the ones who are trying to find time to move the wiki.  Iain
is on vacation in Hawaii, and I have been spending my available time
analyzing what happenned so that we don't have to move the wiki, just like
you suggested.  My analyses says that the problem is that the search script
is brain-dead.  My suggestion is that you leave that script un-executable,
and make the rest of the scripts executable again so that we can continue
our collaboration.  There is no longer any reason to leave the wiki
unoperational.

Thanks,
Avery J. Regier

Wow.  All these are pretty close to the idea list generated on the wiki
list.  So its in the "to do" pile.  If you or anyone else has other
ideas please feel free to send them directly to me, iain shigeoka
(iainshigeoka@yahoo.com).  I think this thread would be off topic for
the jos admin list. I was going to try and tackle some of these
features in the next upgrade to the wiki after my vacation...  :)

The HTML page seems to be cross-linked. When I click on a message called

Subject: [JOS-Admin] Wiki temporarily relocated

Hello all,

The JOSWiki has been down for the past two weeks and due to a variety
of reasons (most related to my being out of town on vacation) it has
not been fixed.  Basically the wiki needs to be relocated to another
server.  My first attempts to move it to Clark's machine have not
worked.  I have therefore, temporarily relocated it to my server:

http://www.metamech.com/wiki

This is a highly temporary relocation until I can get it on Clark's
machine so don't bookmark pages or do anything that would get the bots
and search engines banging on the site.  I've taken this "emergency"
measure since I won't have time to work on this for another week at
least and we have gone far too long without the wiki.  Please check the
main jos web page

http://www.jos.org

for announcements regarding future relocation of the site.  Comments
and questions should be sent to me or the admin list.  

DO NOT continue this thread on the general or info lists!!! All
followups should go to the admin list or directly to me.

Vote Results

   * 46 possible Voters
   * 12 vote quorum ("extraordinary" vote (25%))
   * 12 Yes vote(s) (Passes if yes >= 66%)
   *  1 Abstain vote(s)
   *  0 No vote(s)

There were a total of 13 Votes placed during the voting period out of a
total of 46 voters subscribed to vote-info on August 2, 1999.  The 46
voter total required an ("extraordinary" vote) quorum of 12 votes
(25%).  This was met by the 13 total votes.  Of the 13 votes, 12 were
"Yes", 1 was "Abstain".  This created a greater than 66% Yes vote to
pass the Constitution.

My apologies for the late report.  Any questions regarding the vote
itself should be sent directly to me, iainshigeoka@yahoo.com.  Any
discussions regarding this result should be made to the appropriate
mailing list (do not reply to all three lists in this crosspost).
