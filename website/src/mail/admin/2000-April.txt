Subject: [JOS-Admin] Finding archives

When you know the name of a package, do you know how to find its archive?

The "all packages" page has been designed to help you search for a product
based on a package name. It is found at this location:

<URL:http://www.jos.org/redist/src/allpackages.html>

Sometimes your compiler might complain that some class is missing. This
happens most often when re-compiling an open source product for the first
time. What should you do?

1. Look for a LIBRARY.README file. It should contain more instructions
about the dependency a product might have on archives from other products.

2. Download the "runtime" edition of other products. A runtime edition
contains a pre-compiled archive. Otherwise, you could end up wasting your
time downloading all source code for everything.

3. Follow the instructions for installing the archive. This involves adding
the archive to the class path of your javac tool.

Subject: [JOS-Admin] New mailman.

Hi there Clark.

I'm not sure the new version of mailman is working properly. Since some
time in the last 24 hours, all emails being sent to arch@jos.org are
requiring approval. The people who are sending are actually subscribed.

Is anyone else having this problem? (Of course, if the admin list is
having this problem, nobody will be reading this email until someone
approves it :-)

I tried allowing non-members to post without approval and it is still
asking everyone for approval.

one slight difference in the e-mail address and it won't
go through...

Not yet; my post to kernel went through, and there was one
other post since then.  I'd like to keep the moderation
for people who arn't signed up on the list... about 50% of
the e-mails caught are spam, and another 25% are infrequent
posters with irrelevant posts.

It seems to be working for me.  My last e-mail to arch@jos.org 
was 'held'; but, as it turns out, I was not a subscriber.

Some of our lists (the kernel and general) get a good amount
of SPAM... this non-member approval blocks most of it.

I'm thinking that the database needs to be "re-built" or
something like that by adding/removing a member.... 
testing hypothesis.

Friends,

The time has come where we need to find a new
home for our web site.  Helmut is not pleased
with CVS or Mailman running on his box since
he believes them to be too hungry.  

We should be doing this very quickly; as
he cannot afford to have Mailman or CVS 
running over Easter weekend.

Sorry for the sudden news-drop.  

Best,

Clark

Subject: [JOS-Admin] We are moving...

OK.

If this needs to happen by this weekend, we need to do triage.

1) Website.  Well, who owns the jos.org name?  I assume we'll 
need cooperation to redirect the name to another machine.  For the 
moment, I'd say we should point it to your (Clark's) machine that 
already hosts wiki.jos.org and temporarily just relocate the 
index.html page, or redirect to my server (www.metamech.com).  
Since most everything is in wiki and its hosted in metamech the 
website is pretty unaffected (other than the home page) by the 
move.  If helmut is bowing out and is the official point of contact for 
the jos.org name, we should have an active member gain 
"ownership" of the jos.org name (internic entry).

2) Mailing lists.  We can use the sourceforge mailman services to 
take over mailing lists.  The only trick is having the jos.org machine 
forward mailing list traffic to the appropriate sourceforge mailman 
email addresses.  I don't have much time to do this this weekend 
so unless someone else is willing to do this, I think mailing lists 
will just have to be shutdown for at least this weekend.  I can work 
on this next week.

3) CVS.  We've already started moving the core kernel code into 
the sourceforge cvs server.  I say we simply shutdown the jos.org 
cvs.  Any references to the jos.org cvs server needs to be updated 
to point to the sourceforge cvs.  Kernel code goes into sourceforge 
(Todd "_quinn" is taking care of this).  Other subprojects will have 
to open up new sourceforge accounts and check their sources into 
those sourceforge project cvs repositories.  We'll have to 
coordinate to get the webpages to tie the sub-projects back 
together...

Am I missing anything?

Currently Helmut is the legal owner of the name.  

Helmut, what exactly do you require for ownership
to be transfered; I tried last year (I went through
all the effort to setup an LLC and everything), but 
I did not meet your requirements.

I hope so.

Perhaps re-directing to your server would be better...

Well, if it was setup at my box; I could have the forwarding
take place.

I agree with Ian. Since you got a working cvs on sourceforge,
and since the cvs on jos.org is probably way too flakey to be
worth trying to fix it, the only reasonable solution is to move
it's content to the working cvs.

Any scripts that are a potential embarrassment should not be
on a multi client server. You can't expect dozens of people who
each PAY for 200 to 500 GIG traffic and high reliability to just
ignore it when ONE non-commercial client denies service to
everybody else with flakey and sloppy code.

And that is exactly what happened yesterday.
/sites/jos/www/cvsweb.cgi  performed a Denial Of Service
attack from the inside out and denied service to many
thousands of visitors to the sites of over a hundred clients.

NOBODY can be allowed to do that on a multi-client server.
Scripts like that belong on home machines, not public servers.

Jos.org should carry the public information and be the central
index or gateway to the different home machines that use
potentially embarrassing scripts.

	I agree.  We can ask SourceForge if they'd be willing to host
the wiki, as well.

	We should be able to add other sub-projects to the 'JOS'
repository.  If everything on the current/old jos.org box is in the CVS,
it can be tarballed and mailed to sourceforge for inclusion... but it may
be better just to take that tarball and see whose subprojects are still
active?  (e.g. by waiting around for them to ask what happened to
CVS)  (How does the SourceServer work?  Can we tarball its repository the
same way?)

Subject: [JOS-Admin] New (well, older) box

I decommissioned my old development box about 2 months ago;
it is a Pentium Pro 180 with about 6 GB hard disk space.
If this is acceptable; I can completely clear the hard
drive (backing it up to my current development box) and
can make it available for JOS usage.  

Although SourceForge, etc. might be nice; I've always
found it helpful to have a dedicated box for development
archives, mailing lists, etc.   Anyway, the box is on a 
DSL line, 384 KB both up and down ; 209.9.30.67

I will have migrated all of my stuff off by tomorow 
morning; will put RedHat 6.1 (or 6.2) on it and will
enable telnet access to it.  

Will this do?

Helmut, in another day or so; assuming we migrate
over, would you point www.jos.org there.  Or, 
better yet, please list me as the technical contact
for the domain (CE2228) and I'll make the changes
myself.

Best Wishes,

Clark

	At the very least, a dedicated box -- whatever else we may run off
of it -- could move the wiki from its 'temporary' home at metamech.  As
long as we'd be redirecting the mailing lists to sourceforge -- e.g. need
have a box running anyway -- that box may as well also handle the mailling
lists, in my opinion.  Wiki shouldn't stress a PPro 180, right?

The PPro could handle the Wiki just fine, and probably cvs, static
apache pages, and the mailing lists...  if it doesn't, we can 
add more memory.

Existing modules:

jos/vm/jjvm	- jvm written in java (appears to be inactive)
jos/interfaces	- RobertFitzsimons' generic kernel interfaces
jos/kernel/rjk	- RobertFitzsimons' kernel
jos/device	- RobertFitzsimons' generic kernel interfaces
jos/library	- Java layer of JOS

In an attempt to simplify the stucture, I'd like to map jos/library to
simply "java" on the new server. Something similar can be done for
Robert's kernel stuff, but since it hasn't been active in a while, we
can postpone the naming decision until later. Likewise with jjvm.

Any objections?

Also, _quinn, I have created myself an account on sourceforge. I suspect
I'll need to be made a JOS admin on sourceforge in order to be helpful
here. Is that do-able?

Thanks.

	No.  Also, while you may want to write the current CVS tarball
into our storage space at sourceforge -- so we won't lose the code! -- we
may want to wait on adding inactive trees to the active CVS.

	Actually, administator priviliges are separate from CVS write
priviliges, which you now have.  (Enjoy!)  The CVSROOT, BTW, is
"/cvsroot/jos", so when doing the imports, import from the directory above
the import and with a module name of that directory.  (For practice, there
/is/ a 'test' directory toplevel in the CVS (along with JJOS).)  I don't
object to having 'jos'-prefixed paths, but it does seem rather redundant
-- unless the project is supposed to go in the jos namespace, perhaps.

	If you need add'l stuff done, talk to me or Iain.  (Both of us
have to approve of you becoming and admin, and haven't heard from him
yet.)  If you want more priviliges on a particular part of the site
(e.g. bugtracking, forums, task manager, patch manager, or support
manager), let me know; I don't think Iain would object.

If you mean the anonymous FTP area, I don't seem to have write access to
it.

Is it possible to restrict CVS write access for each developer to
different directories, as I was doing on jos.org?

Exactly. The "java" module would be the directory containing the top
level java package names.

I'll have to read up on what these are before I know if I need them.
patch manager sounds interesting. I'd like to know if there is a way to
manage restricting CVS write access to certain subdirectories (as I
described above).

	The 'file releases' section works from downloads.sourceforge.net's
/incoming directory.  To copy things to the anonymous ftp, you must use
'scp', the SSH remote copy utility.  An example is in the test.txt file up
there now.  ( at ftp://jos.sourceforge.net/pub/jos/test.txt )

	'CVSROOT' is a module in the CVS, so we should be able to write to
the 'avail' there.  Unfortunately, when I tried it, it didn't work at all;
it depends on a line in commitinfo which calls a perl script (distributed
with CVS?) to parse the 'avail' file.  I'll ask the SourceForge admin if
that script is available, or if we can install it.

Subject: [JOS-Admin] New (well, older) box

I agree, stuff like that should be on a separate box.
When Wiki runs OK, a 486 is more than enough.
That's what it was written on. However, when it goes wild, even a big
Sun server can't handle it.

The same goes for your cvs.
Code like that should each be on a separate box, preferably with a
phone-in X-10 switch for hard rebooting it if nobody is around. The
way those programs hog resources when they go wild you probably
will need that occasionally.

Neither one of those two programs should be allowed to drag down the
public or other areas of JOS.

Ideally in a development environment you would have a "public"
machine that is the gateway to the different "private" development
machines. None of the development machines can drag down the
public machine, so that one is used not only for a gateway but also
for safe storage of encrypted back-ups. Timed incremental back-ups
from the development machines ensure that even a complete
hardware failure of any one of them does not loose more than a few
hours of work.

Each of the development machines should have the programs of the
other ones set up and ready, so that in a pinch the data from the
gateway machine can be restored onto it and so that it can carry
the functions of a dead development machine until that one is fixed.

With a set-up like that cheap "disposable" 486, 586 and Pentium
machines can be used for all but the main gateway and back-up
storage.

It still says permission denied. I guess it's because the cron system
hasn't copied across my password information yet.

The way I set it up, avail was not being version controlled by CVS so it
wasn't technically part of the CVSROOT module. That was just a security
measure. It looks like the file can be added to CVS and the plain text
file will be generated automatically, meaning that if we wanted to we
could administor the avail file through CVS. We just need to make sure
only one or two people have write access to this file!

Editing it through shell access would be more secure, though. Do I have
permission to log in and edit CVSROOT files using ssh? I wouldn't know
since even scp doesn't work for me yet.

Yes, cvs_acls.pl is distributed with CVS in the contrib directory.

No; it is doing just fine.  Helmut just doesn't want 
anything but static web pages on the site; that's all.

CVS is particularly "nasty" for a regular web
server since it is hard disk intensive; and 
thus defeats most casheing mechanisms.

It sounds to me like cvsweb.cgi was being hit by a crawler because no
robots.txt file (or whatever) was put in place.

Does this sound about right?

Yes, that's what it looked like. cvsweb.cgi hogged all resources.
And it takes a lot of messing to stall a dual processor Sun with
512 MB of RAM.

When we chmoded cvsweb.cgi to not executable, the load dropped
from 75 to 4 and everything else resumed normal operation.

I've changed my mind on that. I think there should be a module for each
set of packages that are to go in a single jar file when we release.

So, we might have modules such as:

JJOS
JosCore
SwingToolkit
...

Inside JosCore, we might have:

README
src
docs

This makes it much easier to do releases and keeps license files and
documentation with each package.

Any objections/comments?

Clark, you are full of shit !
YOU are the one using static web pages,  and flakey PERL code.

The grown-ups use dynamic web pages that are generated by SSI or by fast
and clean C code. Look at any of the card sites on any of our machines !
All you see is templates, compact C programs, thousands of image files and
millions of little data files. Lots of disk access without ANY problem.

The problem was NOT drive access, but ONE flakey program hogging RAM
and processes. I have suggested to you for years to find a programmer and
get that ancient stuff ported to C where you have proper error checking
routines built in.

I have NEVER discouraged the use of executables. We are one of the few
places that allow executables outside of a baby-pen or cgi-bin.
We probably have the highest rate of active executables per domain of any
high traffic web host.

We have always encouraged the use of executables, but we can't allow
sloppy code from ONE domain denying access to everybody else.

Hi Ryan
As far as I know, there is a robots.txt file higher up in JOS. That was put 
there years ago.
Crawlers spider that machine continuously, but I doubt that they ever go 
that deep into JOS.
And wherever they go, they didn't stop going there when the cvsweb.cgi was 
chmoded to not executable.

Just reading text and data files should not be a problem either.

Compare for example all the big sites that have a program to check through 
hundreds of thousands of postcard data files every midnight to see it they 
are due for delivery on that day. Even though the stats and the back-ups 
are run at the same time, it's no problem for a machine like that, because 
all those programs use fast C code that executes and gets out of the way, 
unlike PERL or BASIC.

It would be more efficient in C, but the problem is that cvsweb.cgi has
to be able to reconstruct any version of any file from the diffs CVS
stores. This is an intensive operation in any language - just less
intensive in C.

As for the CVS server itself, the latest version was rewritten entirely
in C for speed. Maybe that would have helped. But we all seem to agree
on moving our CVS repository over to sourceforge.net anyway. Sorry for
putting such a load on your server.

Hi Ryan
The resultant boost in speed is actually of secondary consideration.
The main reason is that you want to get away from calling an interpreter 
for every instruction.
In GW-BASIC or PERL you have a script that calls an interpreter and loads 
that into RAM.
Nearly 5 MB of RAM is tied up until that is completed. If something loops 
without closing,  just a measly one hundred of them will bring a 512 MB RAM 
dual processor machine to a halt. THAT's the main reason for porting to C 
and compiling to self-sufficient code.

The speed gains are a welcome fringe benefit :-)

Sorry for being out of contact for so long, but I moved and have been

Anyway about my current code on the jos cvs server, don't bother moving it
over to the sourceforge.  Over the last number of month's i've rewritten
all the code, but the code hasn't settled down enought to be put into cvs.

So maybe in a month or two i'll be ready to import the code into cvs, but
in the mean time I might organize a tarball release or two.

Helmut is right about a "gateway" machine. We must try to understand what
he is saying. Helmut is rightfully complaining about CVS and CVSWeb, just
as he rightfully complained about JOS Wiki.

It doesn't sound to like Helmut is complaining about maintaining a
"gateway" machine for the JOS Project. A "gateway" machine on the Internet
is the main "www" machine. It is where you look for our home page. It is
<URL:http://www.jos.org/> and, should continue to be.

Auxilliary machines, or "developer" machines, can be added, removed,
upgraded, downgraded, reorganized, change and redesigned -- without
affecting the "gateway" machine.

We need to learn this lesson. We should use machine names like they are
supposed to be used. A machine's physical location is irrelevant. A
machine's IP address is irrelevant. Who owns the box is irrelevant. How
many boxes we need is irrelevant. Transparency is the entire purpose of
machine name resolution services on the Internet.

1. "jos.org" is a domain, not just a machine name.

2. JOS HTTP should /always/ run on a machine called "www.jos.org".

3. JOS FTP should /always/ run on a machine called "ftp.jos.org".

4. JOS Wiki should /always/ run on a machine called "wiki.jos.org".

5. JOS CVS and CVSWeb should /always/ run on a machine called "cvs.jos.org".

6. Additional names can be added, as needed.

It is neither necessary nor desireable to run HTTP and FTP and Wiki and CVS
and CVSWeb on the same machine. We need a server farm, not one big server.

Broken links are hazzardous. We would give people the repeated impression
that the JOS Project is dead by constantly moving services around. We must
never do that. If we're going to fix this, we should fix it right -- so
that it never happens again.

Mailing lists are the primary means of communicating on critical issues.
Look at us now. We're using the administration mailing list to decide on a
very critical issue.

The mailman program does not have to run on the same machine with HTTP,
FTP, Wiki, CVS and CVSWeb, does it? Mailman might run on a separate
machine, called "mailman.jos.org". The machine's physical location is
irrelevant. The machine's IP address is irrelevant. Who owns the machine is
irrelevant.

And still, the "gateway" server must point to THE mailman application. As
an open source project, we cannot afford to cut our lines of communication.
Our mailing list should be important enough to put it on a separate machine.

How many boxes do we need?

We need one for "www.jos.org", which we already have thanks to Helmut.

We need one for "wiki.jos.org", which we already have thanks to
metamech.com. The Wiki and HTTP services should never run on the same
machine. A Wiki snapshot should be stored redundently on an HTTP service --
just in case the Wiki service goes down.

We need one for "ftp.jos.org". The FTP and CVS services should never run on
the same machine. A CVS snapshot should be stored redundently on an FTP
service -- just in case the CVS service goes down.

We need one for "cvs.jos.org". We almost have one thanks to SourceForge.
Both CVS and CVSWeb must either (1) run on one machine, or (2) share a file
server. I made a snapshot of JOS CVS on April 20, 2000. This snapshot does
not contain a revision history, only the latest revision.

Or more commonly, lists.jos.org. But does this change the email address
to kernel@lists.jos.org, or is there a way to leave the address the
same? Other than that, I agree with Gilbert that this style of naming is
more flexible. The sub domain names can be moved around to different
machines, or the same machine, transparently.

Right
That is exactly the proper way to do it.
Right now the MX for mailman.jos.org points to a separate machine.
Ideally the skeleton for the mail should be on more than one of the
satellite machines, so that data can be "restored" onto them quickly from
the central gateway if the usual mail handler machine goes down.

	Our static webpages (gfx, etc) can be served by Helmut's machine

	This should be run on a separate, 'development' box, since we
don't run it running away on someone's production machine
(e.g. metamech.com).  My understanding is that wiki is mostly perl; it
this is the case, we may well want to re-write it.  Something using PHP
comes to mind, if for no other reason than that SourceForge hosts PHP
databases :)

	This we can point to cvs.jos.sourceforge.net and leave

that.  (http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/?cvsroot=jos)

Hello all,

Sorry for the lack of communication.  I'm really swamped.  

OK, the main crises is that helmut wants cvs off his machine 
NOW.  This has already been accomplished since helmut has shut 
down csv_web on his machine (and I assume cvs as well).

The kernel sources have been moved to sourceforge.net so go 
there for the latest cvs.  All other sources are available via Gilbert's 
jos distribution.  CVS for these projects should be checked into 
separate sourceforge projects for now.  We'll worry about re-
integration later.

Mailman.  Helmut, I assume we can leave this running on your 
machine at least for this weekend?  If so we'll do that.  Then, when 
people have time, we should activate the sourceforge mailman 
service and alias the mailing list email addresses to the 
sourceforge mailing list addresses.  Users should see no difference 
except the list admin pages are on sourceforge and the archives 
will start showing up in sourceforge.  We should make a static 
archive of the spin.de and current mailman archives on helmut's 
machine and post them to the jos static site to keep the rest of the 
list archives available.

ftp.  we'll continue using helmut's machine for this purpose for now 
(if that's alright with helmut).

I agree that the machine naming should be improved asap to make 
these infrastructure changes invisible to end users.

I'd like to get it off metamech at some time.  The wiki is not very 
nice as is.  Right now its leaking about 20-25 MB of error logs a 
month because of some very minor perl code errors (probably due 
to my hacking to get it to behave).

Since its so finicky, I think migrating it to a separate box that won't 
hurt anyone other than itself is a Very Good Idea (tm).

Yup.

This sounds good.  Although, there really is nothing to the static 
web serving (a single page) so I see no reason to phyiscally 
separate it from the wiki machine.  The FTP machine on the other 
hand should be a separate machine (and mirrored if possible).

> machine.  Mailman can be run on either Clark's machine or continue to

I would actually suggest moving this to sourceforge.  They are 
using mailman and are paying someone to maintain the 
installation.  It basically offloads this responsibility from any jos 
member (I'm totally for less work).  It should be easy to alias the 
present list addresses to work seamlessly with the sourceforge 
hosted lists.  Plus, one less machine for us to worry about.

Well, sourceforge handles most shortterm backups, so we only 
need to do "golden" backups.  Probably safest if we just ask some 
members to grab certain daily backups say once a month and burn 
it onto a cdr and store it somewhere.

Yes.  I've already ported wiki to PHP which works about 10 times 
faster, and has a bunch of new features (including search!).  Just 
haven't had time to roll it out.  And won't until late may.  If someone 
wants to take my (very ugly) code and try and get it running now, 
you're welcome.  Otherwise, I say we keep the perl version limping 
along until I have time in may to upgrade the wiki.  I agree we 
should move this to a separate development box sometime in the 
future.

Hi Ian

All we did was chmod cvsweb.cgi to be non executable and announce that we 
can not risk  to have that one flakey script running amok again during the 
Easter rush and that that ONE file will remain turned off till after the 
Easter rush, and that we hoped it will be fixed or replaced by then. No 
other file was touched by us.

Setting things up like a proper development environment with the Sun for 
the gateway and central back-up, and disposables for experimental and 
potentially embarrassing stuff, that was just a recommendation.

Especially until wiki and cvs can be upgraded to C, it would be best if 
they each were on separate PC's, so that neither of those two can lock out 
the other one. In time any number of PC's can be added as satellite 
machines and accessed from the gateway like subdirectories.

FTP is absolutely no problem and never has been.

With the mailman, as long as there are no tangled loops, there is no 
problem. As far as I know there have not been any of those for a couple of 
years.

	Wonderful.  Does anyone have a preference as to where we keep the
mailing lists?  If mailman isn't a problem where it is, we might as well
keep it there for continuity's sake.  (Although aliasing mailmain/lists
.jos.org is probably a good idea if we ever need to move it.)

	Go ahead and send me the code; I'd be happy to look at it.  I
don't know if I'll be able to get it done any earlier, but it won't hurt
to have an extra set of eyes.  (For that matter, why don't you go ahead
and check a 'wiki' module into the SourceForge CVS?)

Right now there are about 40 aliases re the mailman lists, and then most of 
those are MX redirected to outside IP numbers. Some go ( as far as I 
remember ) to spin.de
Personally I would not advise changing that without coordinating it with 
Markus, and since it works, it's probably best not to mess with the mailman.

Which is exactly why it's potentially dangerous. If you add someone to
that ACL, they can delete you. We could edit the cvs_acls.pl script to
define a set of users that cannot be deleted from this acl. I'll
experiment with it...

I found I was able to login to jos.sourceforge.net via ssh. When I
uploaded the old cvs files to the ftp area they didn't have the same
permissions as yours so I _had_ too ssh in to fix it. It seems your
test.txt file was automatically assigned to the "jos" group while mine
wasn't.

	Okay, once I tried logging in with an all-lowercase username,
everything worked.  Either that or I was trying to ssh to
cvs.jos.sourceforge.net, which is a restricted shell.  In either case, it
looks like the cvs and the ftp/web site stuff is one different boxes, so
we can't just point the CVS at our cgi-bin directory...

Helmut, the only problem that I've had with

frame your e-mail in a derogatory manner; implying
that the deveopers in JOS are not adequite
programmers.  This is poor behavior; not that I've

from me no matter what your message may be.

We use cvsweb.cgi (a perl front end to 
the cvs system which is written in c)
and wiki.cgi since the jos people are 
primarly concerned with building a java 
operating system... not a working environment 
for an interactive group. They are two entirely

you have a right to be upset about
perl scripts which go-wacko; but please
understand, we didn't write them for
the most part; and if we did, they are
of secondary concern... quick hacks.  
We are using what ever we can to keep
the project moving.  This is our focus.

As for mailman, it uses python, you had
mentioned "python" showing up high on your
"top" list... if this is a problem; then I'm
sure we can move.  I have mailman working
on my home box (DSL); so perhaps that

Python is alot better than perl...

Hi Clark
if a Formula 1 race car driver does a quick hack on his pick-up,
and the freeway has to get shut down because a quick hack
didn't work out as planned, he's going to get yelled at.

Just like duct tape is not intended for the freeway, PERL hacks
should not be used beyond prototyping, unless they have been
very thoroughly tested. Because PERL has to load the interpreter
for each routine or function, any run-away or uncontrolled loop
spreads the problem as fast as an oil pan full of hot oil on a
freeway curve.

No matter who causes that, somebody will be yelled at for that,
and driving a race car for a living is not an acceptable excuse.

The same applies on the servers. It makes no difference if
somebody is a recent AOL graduate or a professional programmer.
The only difference you might notice is that if the same outfit
needs to get yelled at repeatedly for the same reason, the
yelling tends to get louder with each occurrence.

Try to put it into perspective. This weekend we pumped over
3 Million multimedia postcards, many of them including Java
applets. All of them were active pages generated on the fly.
At Midnight, when the Send-Later parsers cut loose and sorted
through millions of files and picked out all the cards that had been
pre-sent in the last 2 months for delivery today, and then wrote
the pick-up notices for those cards into the mail queue,
there was no problem, even though card sending and picking
was proceeding normally. (In Europe it was already Sunday
morning  at that time and a LOT of last minute cards were sent)


Re Python: Much better than PERL. And you can watch it easily.
If it hangs in TOP, you should optimize and tune your script a bit.
But I have not heard of it ever stalling a server.

Helmut

Subject: [JOS-Admin] machine aliasing/progress

	wiki.jos.org: should currently point at www.metamech.com; will
eventually point to something on a SourceForge server, once we (Iain
and/or I) get PHP wiki running.  For some reason, it looks like this
currently points at "appletreedesign.com".  (Huh?)

	cvs.jos.org: should point at cvs.jos.sourceforge.net.  Though the
links on the default project page don't point here for CVSweb, they seem
to work just fine.  Currently unaliased.
(cvs.jos.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/JJOS/?cvsroot=jos)

	lists.jos.org: should point at Helmut's machine.  Currently
unaliased.

	ftp.jos.org: Does not seem to allow anonymous access?  (Helmut, am
I doing something horribly wrong, or is that the case?)  Currently points
at Helmut's machine; could be redirected to jos.sourceforge.net if
necessary.

	www.jos.org: running beautifully, pointing at Helmut's machine.


	Action summary: wiki.jos.org needs to be corrected; cvs and
lists .jos.org need to be created.  Question about ftp.jos.org needs to
be resolved.

	Regarding backups: most things are up in the air.  First, ftp
backup -- if we have to move our primary to jos.sourceforge.net, it can no
longer serve as a backup.  Second, CVS & CVSweb.  Right now, we don't have
a backup plan in case disaster strikes at sourceforge, unless/until Clark
sets them up on his new box.  (Clark, how is that coming along?)  
Mailing-list wise, sourceforge will provide them, but their names will be
different, all prefixed with "jos-"; I don't see any way around this.  
(That means it would probably be better to have Clark's machine handle the
mailing list backups.)  Fourth, a wiki backup.  This could also be run on
Clark's machine; as a PHP program, it shouldn't cause stability problems.  
Helmut -- does dearwebby already run mySQL/PHP?  (I understand that it's a
bear to set up.)  What we can do w.r.t. backups right away is copy
the static stuff from Helmut's machine to the sourceforge site and request
a tarball of the current CVS archive, should we need to put it elsewhere.

	Feedback?

Hi Todd
Anonymous (Wide Open) FTP just leads to trouble (and has in at least one 
case I remember about 2 years ago when a JOS member left in a huff and in 
parting apparently overwrote maybe a bit more than just his own stuff)

However, since about Netscape 3 downloading via browser is quite reliable 
and a better way to handle that. You simply put all stuff that is approved 
for public downloading into a directory that does not have an index.html. 
That works fine for insiders who know what the file names are about.

	Well, I would assume we'd limit it to read-only, but like I said,
"if necessary."  Right now, there's no advantage to anon ftp.

Sure.  Point wiki.jos.org to metatech.com.  Alternatively, Iain,
you can have the root password to the box here (cantor.clarkevans.com)
and set it up as you please.  In either case, the DNS entry
needs to be changed once again...

I'm sure Helmut can add this entry.

Or mailman could be setup on cantor.clarkevans.com if helmut
has a probem with python running on his box.

Hemut's suggestion about using tarballs with an http link
should work... thoughts?

I have backed up the items I need from that box onto 
another box.  If someone wants the passwd and take
ownership of it great.... otherwise I could easily
setup an ftp account on one of the boxes.  

Then, we could write a shell script that tars up
each box (cvs,mail,http,wiki) and ftps a copy
over to my box.  This could even be done as
a cron job... say 2am EST.

Yes; I suppose that the box I have could be setup
as a backup of all of the other boxes.  It has 2 hard
drives; another cron job could be setup during the
day to replicate one drive to the other.

He he he.

In many ways, this may be a language and culture clash issue.  I 
often have to give Helmut's emails a day or two to cool off before 
responding.  :)  I guess its part of the cons (or maybe pros) of that 
"world-wide community building process" thing...

I'd prefer not pointing it at metamech.com since my hosting 
company changes $20 to setup the aliases.  So lets point it at 
Clark's box.  I'm not sure about hosting the wiki on SourceForge 
anytime in the near future for two reasons:
1) it will suffer from the same problems that makes Helmut kick us 
off every quarter or so... highly experimental code with long periods 
of neglect.
2) tweaking and adjusting code running on SourceForge's http 
server is a major pain (at least for me).  I can't use their ssh file 
transfer program so I'd have to hand edit everything over ssh.

So I vote for making clark's machine the main wiki server.  Plus, we 
can tweak it freely and not worry so much about security breaches 
getting us in major trouble...

Why not point it at sourceforge and use their mailman setup?

I like it.  True ftp sites like cdrom.com, download.com, or some 
other personal sites can mirror our stuff for ftp functionality if it 
becomes an issue.

Not sure this is a problem.  sourceforge does backups and 
monitors for crashes.  They'll automatically backup from tape on 
disaster or backup on request (I think they keep a week's worth).  
So we really need to only backup the CVS tarball once a week.  I 
don't think we really need an active backup CVS and CVSweb 
system running...

I think this can either be cron job or simply ask someone to do this 
as a weekly task.  Anyone with a CDR can burn quarterly copies 
and archive it in a safe somewhere to be really paranoid.

I'm going to be absolutely swamped from now until at least June 
with possibly a break here and there.  So if I take it, its going to be 
stop and go (with a lot of stop until mid may).

So perhaps Todd better take it.  Or I guess we both can...  I would 
anticipate the two of us could work together without problems.

Yup.

Yeah, but can't we "invisibly" alias the lists?  So email to 
admin@jos.org goes to helmut's machine, gets automaticaly 
forwarded to jos-admin@listst.sourceforge.net and hits the list 
normally....

It is not setup.  Helmut does not want MySQL on his machine (he 
suggests we use a commercial db) and was highly opposed to 
putting PHP on his machine as well.  I'd say any active pages of 
any sort should be kept off Helmut's machine until they are 
absolutely bulletproofed and coded in C.  We've killed his box and 
pissed him off enough.

The tarballs are posted automatically I think.  I'm still unconvinced 
that we'll need a running backup of the CVS on another machine...  
i think just storing tarball archives is enough.

	scp doesn't work for you?  Strange.  (Are you using openssh?)  I'm
not dead-set on running the wiki on SourceForge's servers, but my
understanding was the experimental PHP wouldn't be as much a problem as
experimental perl; the other advantage being, of course, that they take
care of a good bit of the administration for us.  OTOH, since our wiki
isn't getting an enourmous number of hits (that I'm aware of), clark's box
would work just fine.

> Why not point it at sourceforge and use their mailman setup?

	The jos-* prefixing means we'd have to do address aliasing if we
don't want to change anything, and we lose continuity in the
archives.  Helmut doesn't seem to mind mailman, so I don't see any reason
to inconvenience ourselves to move it.

	Ditto.  I'll be very busy for the next two weeks or so, then have
a nice two-week vacation.  After that, I should have more free time.

	*shrug*  Then we're still dependent on Helmut's machine being up,
which defeats the point of migrating the lists to SourceForge.  (Although
I guess we could always manually adjust our headers until his server came
back up.)

	As long as we have a plan for setting one up if we need it.

Summary?

	current plan:

cvs.jos.org -- at SourceForge
wiki.jos.org -- at clark's box
lists.jos.org -- at Helmut's box, which may redirect them to
	SourceForge lists.  (awaiting commentary)
ftp.jos.org -- unecessary for now.  Redirect to sourceforge anyway? (just
	so something will be there)
www.jos.org -- Helmut's machine

	backups:

cvs.jos.org -- none for now; could run on Clark's box.  keep CVS tarballs
	archived to Clark's box with a cron job.
wiki.jos.org -- none for now; me and Iain are discussing what to do with
	the wiki -- if we get clark's box, running the enhydra application
	server and doing the whole thing in Java.  We lean on SourceForge
	(nicely!) to handle servelets when they get stable.
lists.jos.org -- the other of whichever server ends up handling them
	now, or Clark's box.
ftp.jos.org -- since we don't really need it, none at all -- redirects
	to ftp.cdrom.com (et al) if/when we ever do.
www.jos.org -- SourceForge

Well, I'm on windows.  I found and am using some scp program but

The PHP version would consume much less resources.  And it 
would be nice for SourceForge to handle admin of the site 
infrastructure (server, patches, etc).  I'm just concerned that 
experimental code will cause problems...  Our wiki is getting pretty 
low traffic so I'm pretty sure any box will work.  I'd feel safer 
working in a sandbox like clark's box at first.

Agreed that we should keep mailman where it is for now.  But it 
usually craps out every once in a while and clark has to upgrade 
us.  Next time that happens, I would suggest just "moving" it by 
forwarding listname@jos.org to the sourceforge list addresses.  As 
far as archives, like I said before, we really should get a snap shot 
from spin and jos.org, generate static archive web pages, and put it 
on our website.

Cool.  I guess when either of us is ready to start work, we'll contact 
Clark...

Helmut's machine uptime has never been a problem.  In fact its 
quite stable because Helmut maintains his machines as a job so 
any problems are fixed in minutes.  So things like mail 
forwarding/aliasing on helmut's machine will work... pretty much 
guaranteed.  It's only the custom apps running on helmut's 
machine that's a concern for two reasons:

1) when one runs amok, it pisses helmut off and he kills the app 
(e.g. wiki, cvs_web)

2) we have to fix, update, upgrade the app (like mailman) which is 
always a low priority for us.

Remains at helmut's box until there are problems or someone has 
time.  Then consider and implement a migration to sourceforge.

I certifiable^H^H^H^Hed now (LCP) <g>

Oh, and I have some space at ccactus.com for web, ftp, and
mail  (pop , lists, aliases) if there's any use of it.  The host is
already running perl and php.

Let me know when all this gets rolling so I can cut a PR.
I want Wired to call me on my cell phone at school again :)
