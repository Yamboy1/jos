I did not mean to imply that a smalltime software author should not be
given commit access for their own project. What I meant to say was every
project leader should be given a CVS account, and possibly additional
trusted developers under the project leader.

I agree.

Yes, but eventually I'd like to try a double repository model - one
repository for the masses and one repository for very important code
that we can't risk being destroyed by crackers. - or some other model
that protects very important code.

I don't know the best way to organise multiple cooperating repositories,
but it's an interesting idea.

Wiki security can be increased and wiki can be put under CVS, but CVS
and wiki should still not share passwords -- unless you can propose a
safe way to do so.

PrettyPrinter is in cvs. Somewhere in /projects.

Subject: [JOS-Admin] Wiki update

Hello all,

The JOS wiki has been upgraded.  The new version
supports stricter rendering rules (should allow more freedome to write
what you want where you want it).  Basically, markups must be "stuck"
to words and surrounded by at least one space.
See http://jos.org/wiki/view/Wiki for more info.

In addition, the new wiki integrates version control into the
interface, and adds searching capabilities.  Please note that the
search abilities are currently pretty slow and resource intensive so if
you know your exact page name, please use the "Go" box instead of the
search form.  The wiki also supports categories for pages but I have
not exposed it until I've had a little more time to investigate it.

Any bug reports, comments, and improvement suggestions should be
emailed to me, webmaster@jos.org, or posted to the admin@jos.org list.

	I'll second this.  I'm not sure how the back-end of mailman works,
but it should be possible to create a unified subscription
box like openSSL's without too much trouble.

Agreed.  I'd actually like an advanced interface similar to mailman
(with admin options), with an initial interface that's simple like
openSSL's.  And instead of mailman (which, as I understand, uses its
own mailer), actually back it with majordomo doing the list work if
possible.  Then we can consolidate all our mailing lists together
(instead of having announce stranded due to too many subscribers).

Clark, since you set it up mailman, any idea how hard it would be to
port its functionality to support a majordomo backend and play well
with our planned (but waiting for me to have the time) centralized
"account" management system?  I haven't looked at the mailman source
and have not tried putting front ends on majordomo before so I'm not
sure how practical my idea is.

Would not be all that hard.... it would take some time
to go over what they are doing.  I'm sure if it was
contributed, they would support it.  It should be built
into the "public list" pages, adding a checkbox
next to each one if you want to subscribe.  Then,
using a POST to send it to the server.  Our version 
could be customized to add Wiki support as well.

i just don't have time now... *sigh*

Yeah.  I know what you mean about no time!  ;)  I may dig into the
MailMan sources then... I'm also going to investigate how difficult it
would be to move our announce list to mailman. I know that its still at
spin because of the huge subscription... 

However, I did some reading on list software and the primary reason
that Mailman-like software can't handle it is because you typically
want the entire list to recieve mail at the same time (or close to it).
 This is not a problem for us because the only really big list we have,
is one way.  Extremely low traffic announce only.  

So, even a timed perl script that slowly chugs through the list, giving
sendmail breaks between blocks would get the list out... Of course it
may be a day or more between the first people getting emails and the
last but who cares?  It may actually be good because then our website
won't get slaughtered if we make an announcement and 20,000 people hit
the site at once!  :)  Yeah, optimistic but possible.

Anyhow, it would really be nice to centralize the lists.  I was also
hoping to add list creation capabilities to "project lead" accounts so
that each project could create a private, announce, and public mailing
list specific to their project...

This bug should be fixed.  i.e., the mailman software
should be able to handle the large subscription list now.

This is nice, however, entries to /etc/aliases are added
in the subscription process, and then newaliases must
be run to re-create the sendmail database.... I guess
this could be automated, what are the security issues?

	Don't know if anyone has helped you this yet.  AFAIK, we have no
plans to allow anonymous write access to CVS. I'm forwarding this to the
admin list in hopes that someone there will know more about how we want to
do things like this.  (AFAIK, the JOS SourceServer is still around...)

	If all else fails, I can probably write you into the permissions
list; you might want to try committing your skeleton to a non-canonical
directory first.

Hi Sean.

There are currently two source code repositories. One is the
SourceServer which contains all of the java source code, the other is
the CVS server which hosts the JOS kernel sources. We are planning to
move everything over to CVS, but until we have worked out a plan, you
should continue to use the SourceServer (*).

Once CVS is ready for you, you will require a CVS account (username and
password). That will get rid of the "Access denied" message. Also (FYI)
the code you are trying to commit should be placed relative to
jos/library. So the jos/ui/core package would be stored in
jos/library/jos/ui/core.

(*) Unfortunately, the last I heard is that SourceServer has stopped
working. The person who set it up has disappeared.

Subject: [JOS-Admin] Seeking help obtaining "JavaOS for Business" documentation

Hi All;

I hope that this is the right forum for these queries.

In order to make more progress, I would like the jjos+decaf effort to "chase the
tail-lights" of IBM's "JavaOS for Business."  At one point in time, there were
about 500+ pages of PDF-format documentation on the APIs (e.g., guides for
writing device drivers, etc.).  I think it would really help our particular
effort if we just re-implemented these APIs.

However, the web site:
	http://www.ibm.com/developer/java/
seems to have undergone a substantial reorganization, and I can no longer find a
page for which I can post a URL to the kernel mailing list.  This is a real
drag.

This leaves me (us?) with 1 or 2 problems:

(1) How can I, or can anybody out there in the admin@jos.org community, find out
whether we can clone the "JavaOS for Business" APIs without getting sued?  Who
is our "point of contact" for the rest of the Java community?  If I can get
assurance that I am in the clear here, I will proceed with all possible haste. 
If not, we're back to square one, and I'll/we'll have to invent our own APIs
(which will hold things up quite a bit).

(2) If we *can* clone the APIs, as a practical matter, how can I make available
to the other jjos+decaf developers the information in the PDF-format "JavaOS for
Business" manuals I downloaded before the web-site reorg?

I appreciate any assistance that any of you can provide.

Thanks!
