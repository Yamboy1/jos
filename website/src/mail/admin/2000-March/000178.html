<PRE>I have been thinking about this:

What prevents us from replacing the Source Server?

1. We cannot shutdown Source Server until we have a corresponding
replacement. We don't have one yet. On the publishing side, we almost have
a feature-for-feature replacement for Source Server. On the contribution
side, we don't have anything.

2. Source Server sorts for interfaces, exceptions, errors, abstract classes
and classes. WebSource does not. How does Source Server do it? We should
put this feature in WebSource.

3. When we shutdown Source Server, there must be a corresponding /source
page that points to its replacement. Could requests for
<A HREF="http://www.jos.org/source">http://www.jos.org/source</A> be redirected?

4. Source Server enables you to download one source file at a time.
WebSource does not. WebSource does not yet publish a plain-text, non-HTML
version of each source file. An entire product is download-able as an archive.

5. The scope of the WebSource project has exceeded the Source Server. I
have included source code that has been submitted through CVS, Source
Server and individual archives.

6. Any member of the JOS Project can publish a product. If it is announced
on a mailing list or JOS Wiki page, it should be published on the
www.jos.org server, shouldn't it?

-----

It is easy to browse the Java source code for the Java project. The &quot;home&quot;
page for browsing is

&lt;URL:<A HREF="http://www.jos.org/redist/src/">http://www.jos.org/redist/src/</A>&gt;

I have been contacting individual authors to let them know their source
code is published on-line. Many have been glad to see it. They have been
working on their code but can't publish it on the www.jos.org server
because Source Server is &quot;broken&quot;.

-----

Just announced on the JOS Project website, WebSource is available for
immediate download. It is free-license and open-source. It created these
static source pages.

WebSource is compatible with Java servlet technology, too. A servlet is
planned. Source code in its original form (.java) can be published
dynamically as syntax-highlighted HTML pages. The WebSource servlet
requires Java 1 Platform and the Java Servlet Development Kit (JSDK).

If the WebSource servlet is running on the same machine with
/redist/mirror, it is possible to dynamically publish directly from .zip or
.jar archives.
