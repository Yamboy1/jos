</I>
There have been two ideas for this so far (that I know of):

1. Iain and I were going to write a user-friendly wrapper around CVS.
2. Someone proposed that we move to SourceForge. 

I am no longer sure how I would prefer to do it.

Let's look at some requirements:

1. Serious developers need full CVS capabilities and control over who
can edit their files.
2. The rest would just like to upload their changes without any hassles.

So, it looks like whichever proposal we choose, we are going to need two
separate repositories with different levels of security and different
management tools.

I am imagining a system in which serious/trusted developers are given
write access to selected parts of the developers' repository, while
everyone has write access to the contributors' repository. Some how,
official updates to the developers' repository are propagated to the
contributors' repository while leaving contributors' changes intact. CVS
(indirectly) provides the ability to do this.

If a contributor has contributed something that they think should be
integrated into the official version, an official developer will copy
the changes made to the contributors' tree and apply them to the
developers' tree.

In order to support automatic synchronisation of the two repositories,
the new SourceServer (the public contributors' repository) should be
based on CVS.

This is just a half-baked idea as yet. I need to think more before I
know it will work.

&gt;<i> 2. Source Server sorts for interfaces, exceptions, errors, abstract classes
</I>&gt;<i> and classes. WebSource does not. How does Source Server do it? We should
</I>&gt;<i> put this feature in WebSource.
</I>
The changes I'm making to your parser might make that easier to
implement.

&gt;<i> 4. Source Server enables you to download one source file at a time.
</I>&gt;<i> WebSource does not. WebSource does not yet publish a plain-text, non-HTML
</I>&gt;<i> version of each source file. An entire product is download-able as an archive.
</I>
I see a number cooperating components:

1. The developers' repository
2. The contributors' repository
3. Publishing tools for (2)
4. cvsweb (serves text/plain source files in CVS over HTTP)
5. WebSource (converting source files to HTML)
6. Javadoc

If WebSource needs to display plain text, it can link to cvsweb. If it
wants inline publishing and downloading capabilities, it can link to the
other systems, written in other programming languages.

SourceServer itself does not HTML'ify java files, it cooperates with
PrettyPrinter to do that. In the same way, WebSource does not need to
implement all of the functionality; Other components can take care of
that.

&gt;<i> 5. The scope of the WebSource project has exceeded the Source Server. I
</I>&gt;<i> have included source code that has been submitted through CVS, Source
</I>&gt;<i> Server and individual archives.
</I>
See above.

&gt;<i> WebSource is compatible with Java servlet technology, too. A servlet is
</I>&gt;<i> planned. Source code in its original form (.java) can be published
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically as syntax-highlighted HTML pages.
</I>
Do you mean java-&gt;HTML conversion on the fly?
