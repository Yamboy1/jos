<PRE>Hello,

Sorry for the lag.  My computer decided to die...

Agreed.  JOS.org should always remain the common, point of contact for jos
developers.  An organization not a company.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Agreed.  And if it had a half way decent PR department, JOS would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; really easy to push at the media.  It would also represent JOS at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; conferences and trade shows!

</I>&gt;<i> I don't know how big an organization would be required for something

In addition, a smaller company will put more focus on JOS and promoting
its long term goals than a larger company which may only have a short term
interest in the project.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; And simply serve as a legal entity when making deals.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Very important, but if JOS.com and JOS.org (this seems an easier way to
</I>&gt;<i> differentiate them) are separate the deals and contracts would be with
</I>&gt;<i> JOS.com so if it goes under JOS.org wouldn't be pulled down with it. (of
</I>&gt;<i> course I know little about law)
</I>
Of course.  jos.org shouldn't make commercial deals or be interested in
making money.  Even as a non-profit organization, this is a danger
(becoming too commercialized) so I think the best strategy is to keep
jos.org as it is.  Very hard to make decisions which is good and bad.  Bad
because decisions are hard to make, but good because it can't make bad
decisions.

&gt;<i> we need JOS.com to act as proxy, to handle the legalities of these
</I>&gt;<i> deals. Maybe e-toolz would like to invest in JOS.com (again, ignorance
</I>&gt;<i> on my part.) I imagine e-toolz isn't the only company that could help 
</I>
I don't think this would really work.  This structure us currently being
tried with well established open source projects like apache and perl and
I can see how the model may work for them.  But without a well established
and pervasive software package, it would seem wasteful and doomed to form
a company to support a product that doesn't exist.

Even if the company didn't do anything until JOS first comes out, you need
to pay taxes, do accounting, and handle other legal hassles just to exist.

&gt;<i> strategist. And I'd encourage you to do that just as long as they
</I>&gt;<i> understand they hold no special office in JOS.org.
</I>
Yup.  We plan to use it like we use linux (develop drivers, customize,
etc).  Further arrangements would need to be worked out (probably after
JOS is a shippable product.
