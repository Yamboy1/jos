For the &quot;sugar daddy&quot; model there are some rules too.
Nobody wants to deal with a bunch of disorganized anarchists except maybe 
to split one or two off the herd and exploit them individually.
A policy that has been agreed on at least a &quot;till further notice&quot; basis, 
should be top priority. While this could be a condensed version of the 
constitution, it should be nailed down, voted on and posted.

Second on the priority list should be a posted official contact list. Ian 
might be the obvious choice for that, however, he should be protected 
behind a volunteer that weeds out tech support and similar questions. If 
Ian is too busy, some spokesperson, not a decision maker, just a 
spokesperson, should be found to present one solid front. No matter how 
much arguing and debating is going on on the inside, the world should see 
only the results of that, and not have to wonder which member to listen to.

Third on the priority list should be a decision on what any funds or 
donations would be used for.

Fourth on the priority list should be a decision how funds are received and 
distributed.
&quot;Is that check to be for Ms Jos Org,  or is that Mrs ?&quot;
Yeah, right.

As long as I am not involved with point 3 and that is taken care of and 
nailed down,
I can take care of point 4 with the secure payment stations and carts on 
our servers. However, I would demand a total separation of point 3 and 4.

Once those 4 points are in place, that could be considered a major milestone.
