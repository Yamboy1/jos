I'm sorry to hear you are leaving us.  You will be sorely missed.

I understand this problem.  The rote response is to suggest that 
you ignore the doubters or criticizers and continue coding the way 
you see fit.  Of course, its hard to do when you feel your ideas 
(especially highly experimental ones) are being attacked.  

If others feel the same as Ryan and are tempted to 'throw in the 
towel' please let us know.  I'd like to try and convince you to stay.

Ryan, I wish you the best on your future work and would be very 
grateful if, when rheise.os finds a new home, to let us JOS'ers 
know so we can keep up to date on your work and hopefully 
integrate it into JOS in the future.
