<PRE>Hi, 

I thought this is actually more an admin issue than general discussion and
so I'm reposting it to the admin list.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't know if this is going to be a popular idea or not, but I feel
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to say something because I think it is something JOS needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; successful. All I ask is that it is considered and discussed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hey, people need to speak their minds, popular or not.  I'm glad you
</I>&gt;<i> brought it up (I was tempted to do the same and now I have the perfect
</I>&gt;<i> excuse to also chime in).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My proposal is that we create a small, symbiant, corporation: a JOS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; company to aid JOS the non-profit and live off its creations. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; corporation would (or rather: could) create and sell CD's of common
</I>&gt;<i> JOS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distributions similar to red-hat (although the differences would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; obvious) it could provide tech support, handle the more quotidian
</I>&gt;<i> tasks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of maintaining the JOS website perhaps it could even hold a small
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; payroll of professional programmers to do nothing but write for JOS.
</I>&gt;<i> Of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; course JOS the non-profit would be a separate organization, it would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stay much as it is, JOS the corporation would support itself on JOS
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grassroot open source project, the benefit to the project is the
</I>&gt;<i> company
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would market it, do press releases and the like. These two
</I>&gt;<i> organizations
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would act much like the yin and the yang on the JOS logo, it would
</I>&gt;<i> make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the net result not quite an open source project (which is almost by
</I>&gt;<i> its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nature doomed to obscurity) and a regular company (which is, well, a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; company.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also agree.  IMHO Our website for instance is a &quot;wasted&quot; resource. 
</I>&gt;<i> I've
</I>&gt;<i> been looking at our traffic and the types of visitors we have and have
</I>&gt;<i> always thought that we should be selling small ad space on it.  The
</I>&gt;<i> money
</I>&gt;<i> could be funneled back into the effort ... at the very least maybe to
</I>&gt;<i> sponsor members to attend java conventions like JavaOne.  As soon as you
</I>&gt;<i> get into money though, you start talking about needing some sort of
</I>&gt;<i> entity
</I>&gt;<i> to legally handle these issues.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I wouldn't even know to start with something like this, but I think it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would have several benefits:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *In its own self-interest it would create awareness of the JOS project
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.  And if it had a half way decent PR department, JOS would be
</I>&gt;<i> really easy to push at the media.  It would also represent JOS at
</I>&gt;<i> conferences and trade shows!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *Its products would be JOS-oriented, opening it up to a larger market
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (You know &quot;JOS for complete morons&quot; -- stuff like that :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> True.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *It could create alliances with or get contracts from governments and
</I>&gt;<i> --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more likely -- universities
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And simply serve as a legal entity when making deals.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *If possible, it would hire programmers who could work exclusively on
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (while still maintaing the open source grassroot nature of the
</I>&gt;<i> project,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that is to say they would be just like any other JOS member [hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they would have already been JOS members] and their code would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assayed on merit -- just like everyone else's)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.  And they could take on the 'dirty' tasks such as, if necessary,
</I>&gt;<i> packaging JOS with proprietary software in order to get a truely useful
</I>&gt;<i> product together...  (notice, this little 'wink wink wink' will become
</I>&gt;<i> clear later).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only con I can think of is that we'd have to go through the bother
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of creating a company...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> True.  This can be a problem.  We seem to shy away from the admin issues
</I>&gt;<i> (mostly in my observation because we have a hard time gaining consensus
</I>&gt;<i> and no one wants to make anyone else mad).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ultimately, I want what is best for JOS (long- and short-term) and
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is, after all, just an idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do too.  And now onto my own personal reason for pushing a commercial
</I>&gt;<i> arm of JOS.  A few weeks ago, I joined <A HREF="http://www.etoolz.com/.">http://www.etoolz.com/.</A>  We're
</I>&gt;<i> heavily involved in Java technology and our next product essentially
</I>&gt;<i> needs
</I>&gt;<i> to create a JOS-like system.  Of course, being a JOS member, I started
</I>&gt;<i> promoting JOS as the best solution and everyone here is very excited
</I>&gt;<i> about
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As such, we are interested in the JOS technologies and I've contacted a
</I>&gt;<i> few JOS members privately about possibly working on JOS as consultants. 
</I>&gt;<i> This is in both our interests as Etoolz just need code written and are
</I>&gt;<i> more than willing to keep the code GPL'd or NPL'd or whatever the public
</I>&gt;<i> license is that the code is currently protected by.  In fact, the reason
</I>&gt;<i> we want to pay these particular JOS developers is to have them work on
</I>&gt;<i> certain missing features we really need, and to hopefully accelerate
</I>&gt;<i> their
</I>&gt;<i> development schedules!  Nothing in ink yet, but we're working on it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> NOTE: This is not an open posting for job opportunities.  Just evidence
</I>&gt;<i> that a mutually beneficial commercial relationship should be possible.  
</I>&gt;<i> :) Of course, if you're a 'guru' at linux and java and Xwindows
</I>&gt;<i> programming and are willing to sign an NDA (non-disclosure agreement)
</I>&gt;<i> I'd
</I>&gt;<i> like to talk to you...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The other future benefit for JOS is that our company is licensing the
</I>&gt;<i> Sun
</I>&gt;<i> class libraries.  I see no reason why Etoolz can't port the class
</I>&gt;<i> libraries to JOS in the future to provide a certified class library
</I>&gt;<i> solution for JOS.  If and when classpath or some other library matures
</I>&gt;<i> enough, distributions can then choose what library to package with JOS. 
</I>&gt;<i> JOS developers can maintain cleanroom status by simply using the Etoolz
</I>&gt;<i> binary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the meantime, JOS can begin shipping with a fully complaint library
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> JOS members can concentrate on higher level OS details, tools, or even
</I>&gt;<i> work directly on classpath without being pressured to deliver the
</I>&gt;<i> library
</I>&gt;<i> for JOS so that other people (like the GUI folks) can get going.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as pushing JOS commercially and putting more dedicated time and
</I>&gt;<i> effort into the website and other PR efforts, I think Etoolz would be
</I>&gt;<i> interested in doing that in the future (perhaps early next year).  And
</I>&gt;<i> certainly, if our current product in the works is commercially
</I>&gt;<i> successful,
</I>&gt;<i> we'll be looking to expand our JOS development with possible full or
</I>&gt;<i> part-time dedicated JOS jobs becoming available.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We at Etoolz envision our future relationship to JOS to be similar to
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> of RedHat to linux, or probably more accurately, like Cygnus to gcc.  If
</I>&gt;<i> people in the JOS project feel comfortable with that type of
</I>&gt;<i> relationship,
</I>&gt;<i> I can start developing Etoolz official position on this (gotta talk to
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> boss).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let's keep this discussion on the general mailing list.  If you want to
</I>&gt;<i> contact me privately, please send email to my work address:
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -iain (etoolz software engineer)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ps - Please don't &quot;slashdot&quot; us.  We want to further develop our website
</I>&gt;<i> before really pushing traffic through our site.  Thanks.
