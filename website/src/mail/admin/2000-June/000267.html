<PRE>The first question should be about who will donate the time and the funds
for anything like that.
In 97 I tried raising awareness of JOS and money for JOS with a logo
contest and sale of tee shirts and caps. I spent quite a bit of time and
a money getting it all organized and the goods produced and ready.
The plan was that JOS members would start wearing them and that
friends and people around them would become aware of JOS and would
buy JOS tee shirts to show their support.

How many JOS members believed strongly enough in JOS to spend $10
on a JOS tee shirt or $12 on a JOS cap to get things started ?

Zero. (Except for me)

It does not look like anything has changed enough.
Who is going to play sugar daddy and will plunk down the cash to pay
for incorporation and pay some staff wages ?

If and when there is a sellable product, then the way to go is with JOS.org
members controlling JOS.com at arms length as directors and a paid
business manager running the day to day operation of JOS.com. Money
can then be funneled back to JOS.org easily and quite legally.

However, until there is a sellable product and at least a chance for
expenses to be paid, there is no point in discussing that.
