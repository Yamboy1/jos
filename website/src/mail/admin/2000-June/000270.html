I don't think I ever thanked you for doing that.

&gt;<i> How many JOS members believed strongly enough in JOS to spend $10

Yeah.  I actually started the order process but I hate t-shirts with the
logo on the front.  I asked the dude if he could put it on the back (was
even willing to pay more for it) but it was not an option.  Sorry, I
didn't lend support.

I'm unsure if this type of thing will work before you have a product. 
After a product, sure, its pretty normal.  But before...

Well, this started off with Etoolz proposing possibly filling this role
depending on our future product plans.  This is not something we want to
do now, but something we're discussing over lunch as a possibility
probably next year.  One of our biggest concerns is how the jos community
would react to such a proposal.  Remember, we're a company (many people
immediately don't lik ethat) and we are motivated by making money (as
every company should be).

&gt;<i> If and when there is a sellable product, then the way to go is with
</I>&gt;<i> JOS.org
</I>&gt;<i> members controlling JOS.com at arms length as directors and a paid
</I>&gt;<i> business manager running the day to day operation of JOS.com. Money
</I>&gt;<i> can then be funneled back to JOS.org easily and quite legally.
</I>
I completely agree.  the model only works if there is a sellable product. 
Until then, the only viable commercial involvement that makes sense, is
something like a &quot;sponsor&quot; or &quot;sugar daddy&quot; that has ulterior motives. 
Ours (Etoolz) would be to use the OS in various forms in our products (as
opposed to using an RTOS or linux).
