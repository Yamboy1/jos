<PRE>I guess I should tell you guys that I have left the project. I have
handed the <A HREF="mailto:arch@jos.org">arch@jos.org</A> administration role over to _Quinn who I'm sure
will handle things as smoothly as possible (if there are any objections,
Clark is able to override any changes I've made).

Before I completely vanish, I would also like to give some advice to the
project. There are many ways to design a Java Operating System, and in
many cases it is difficult to determine if one way is better than
another. In reality there are probably several designs that are just as
good as one another, but reality is unknowable. Because of the nature of
reality, it would seem pointless to argue over alternate designs if both
designs have potential. It would be more productive to split JOS up into
separate research groups and see how far people can get with each idea.
When you put all these people together in a single mailing list,
constant disagreements prevent any work from being done.

The reason I have left the project is so that I can continue research in
various areas without having to justify &quot;why&quot;. I will continue to work
on rheise.os, a Java layer for a Java operating system, and experiment
with various types of IPC such as direct object sharing and with various
process, security, user and file APIs. It should be obvious that I am
beyond accepting apologies for uncalled for remarks. I didn't join JOS
to be discouraged from writing a Java operating system. I would have
preferred criticism to come along with reasons. That said, I hope the
JOS project decides to run rheise.os over its kernel but I think it
would be best for me to work on rheise.os separately.

I am thankful to those who made JOS possible. I did benefit from my
experience on the project and I appreciate those who put in the
administrative effort and also those who contributed to the actual
development of JOS. But for now, I wish the project good luck.

Bye.
