</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I don't know if this is going to be a popular idea or not, but I feel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; have to say something because I think it is something JOS needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; successful. All I ask is that it is considered and discussed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hey, people need to speak their minds, popular or not.  I'm glad you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; brought it up (I was tempted to do the same and now I have the perfect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; excuse to also chime in).
</I>
Even when you know its the case its still reassuring to know your not
the /only/ person thinking it.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; My proposal is that we create a small, symbiant, corporation: a JOS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; company to aid JOS the non-profit and live off its creations. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; corporation would (or rather: could) create and sell CD's of common
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; JOS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; distributions similar to red-hat (although the differences would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; obvious) it could provide tech support, handle the more quotidian
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tasks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of maintaining the JOS website perhaps it could even hold a small
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; payroll of professional programmers to do nothing but write for JOS.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; course JOS the non-profit would be a separate organization, it would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; stay much as it is, JOS the corporation would support itself on JOS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; grassroot open source project, the benefit to the project is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; company
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would market it, do press releases and the like. These two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; organizations
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would act much like the yin and the yang on the JOS logo, it would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the net result not quite an open source project (which is almost by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; nature doomed to obscurity) and a regular company (which is, well, a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; company.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I also agree.  IMHO Our website for instance is a &quot;wasted&quot; resource.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; been looking at our traffic and the types of visitors we have and have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; always thought that we should be selling small ad space on it.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; money
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could be funneled back into the effort ... at the very least maybe to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sponsor members to attend java conventions like JavaOne.  As soon as you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get into money though, you start talking about needing some sort of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; entity
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to legally handle these issues.
</I>
Speaking of legal issues, I think it important that JOS stay as it is a
non-profit grassroots (un)orginization that is open to anybody. I think
any JOS corporation should act more as a gardener: help keep the ground
fertile (keep everyone motivated and the website/mailing-lists running),
making sure everything grows (polish abandoned code) and then every now
and then selling the fruit. A JOS corporation would basically be a
parasite on the JOS organization, it would take others effort and sell
it for its own profit; so it is important that this parasite be a
symbiot, that it give as much as it take. Also, if they're separate and
the JOS-corporation goes broke all JOS has to do is find a new web-host.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I wouldn't even know to start with something like this, but I think it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would have several benefits:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; *In its own self-interest it would create awareness of the JOS project
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Agreed.  And if it had a half way decent PR department, JOS would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really easy to push at the media.  It would also represent JOS at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conferences and trade shows!
</I>
I don't know how big an organization would be required for something
like this, but I think we should try to keep it as small as possible and
let it grow at its own rate, otherwise it'll get top-heavy before it has
strong enough roots (I am mister metaphor today.) We are by no means
guaranteed success even if JOS is a success so it should be use to
running on low system resources (there I go again)

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; *Its products would be JOS-oriented, opening it up to a larger market
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (You know &quot;JOS for complete morons&quot; -- stuff like that :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; True.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; *It could create alliances with or get contracts from governments and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; more likely -- universities
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And simply serve as a legal entity when making deals.
</I>
Very important, but if JOS.com and JOS.org (this seems an easier way to
differentiate them) are separate the deals and contracts would be with
JOS.com so if it goes under JOS.org wouldn't be pulled down with it. (of
course I know little about law)

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; *If possible, it would hire programmers who could work exclusively on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (while still maintaing the open source grassroot nature of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that is to say they would be just like any other JOS member [hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; they would have already been JOS members] and their code would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; assayed on merit -- just like everyone else's)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Agreed.  And they could take on the 'dirty' tasks such as, if necessary,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; packaging JOS with proprietary software in order to get a truely useful
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; product together...  (notice, this little 'wink wink wink' will become
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clear later).
</I>
That goes with company contracts like if RealPlayer made a RealPlayer
for Java they could pay us to put it on the JOS desktop distributions (I
believe that's how those things work, again I must confess ignorance)
which would work great for JOS.com and .org, since we'd be selling and
popularizing JOS at the same time.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The only con I can think of is that we'd have to go through the bother
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of creating a company...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; True.  This can be a problem.  We seem to shy away from the admin issues
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (mostly in my observation because we have a hard time gaining consensus
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and no one wants to make anyone else mad).
</I>
That's why I think JOS.com shouldnt &quot;own&quot; JOS.org, JOS.com professionals
would have no more say then the average JOS hacker (in fact they'd have
less since they would have specific tasks to work on.) Ideally, (and
with any luck, practically) they would be two separate entities with two
different but mutually beneficial goals. There's no point in lying any
corporations only goal is to make money, and JOS.com would be no
different but how it did it would benifit JOS.org greatly and that's why
I think its a good idea.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Ultimately, I want what is best for JOS (long- and short-term) and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is, after all, just an idea.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do too.  And now onto my own personal reason for pushing a commercial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arm of JOS.  A few weeks ago, I joined <A HREF="http://www.etoolz.com/.">http://www.etoolz.com/.</A>  We're
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; heavily involved in Java technology and our next product essentially
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to create a JOS-like system.  Of course, being a JOS member, I started
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; promoting JOS as the best solution and everyone here is very excited
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As such, we are interested in the JOS technologies and I've contacted a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; few JOS members privately about possibly working on JOS as consultants.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is in both our interests as Etoolz just need code written and are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more than willing to keep the code GPL'd or NPL'd or whatever the public
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; license is that the code is currently protected by.  In fact, the reason
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we want to pay these particular JOS developers is to have them work on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certain missing features we really need, and to hopefully accelerate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development schedules!  Nothing in ink yet, but we're working on it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The other future benefit for JOS is that our company is licensing the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sun
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; class libraries.  I see no reason why Etoolz can't port the class
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; libraries to JOS in the future to provide a certified class library
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solution for JOS.  If and when classpath or some other library matures
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enough, distributions can then choose what library to package with JOS.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; JOS developers can maintain cleanroom status by simply using the Etoolz
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; binary.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In the meantime, JOS can begin shipping with a fully complaint library
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; JOS members can concentrate on higher level OS details, tools, or even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work directly on classpath without being pressured to deliver the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; library
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for JOS so that other people (like the GUI folks) can get going.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As far as pushing JOS commercially and putting more dedicated time and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; effort into the website and other PR efforts, I think Etoolz would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interested in doing that in the future (perhaps early next year).  And
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certainly, if our current product in the works is commercially
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; successful,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we'll be looking to expand our JOS development with possible full or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; part-time dedicated JOS jobs becoming available.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We at Etoolz envision our future relationship to JOS to be similar to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of RedHat to linux, or probably more accurately, like Cygnus to gcc.  If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people in the JOS project feel comfortable with that type of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relationship,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can start developing Etoolz official position on this (gotta talk to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; boss).
</I>
While I don't disagree and am not strongly opposed to that, I think it
might not be the best way to handle it. I like the idea but I just think
we need JOS.com to act as proxy, to handle the legalities of these
deals. Maybe e-toolz would like to invest in JOS.com (again, ignorance
on my part.) I imagine e-toolz isn't the only company that could help us
like this, and Id hate to limit JOS (.com or .org.)

I applaud any company hiring programmers to work on an opensource
project that would benefit them, both from the standpoint of a
programmer who beliefs in open-source and free software and as a
strategist. And I'd encourage you to do that just as long as they
understand they hold no special office in JOS.org.

While I don't want to talk this thing into the ground, I do want to here
others opinions on these matters before anyone does anything (but still
talk to them; a possible relationship with a corporate entity willing to
further our goals is, of course, exciting.)

Cheers,
DigiGod
