My name is Dustin Tidwell.  I am CEO of the startpoint corporation.  I =
am contacting you today to inquire as to the status of your Java OS.
=20
The reason that I ask is that startpoint is a privately funded company =
(that means there isn't any money yet) which seeks the development of an =
all-in-one internet site.  Not only do we wish to provide access to =
every utility available on the internet, but we also want to build a =
Java OS into our site.  This would allow all of our users, which =
subscribe free of charge, access to numerous programs and facilities.  =
No longer would they have to buy the expensive program for one use and =
then be stuck with it. =20
=20
Where we plan to make our money is the advertising revenue and =
licensing.  Computer application developers such as IBM and Microsoft =
would develop applications to run in Java, then pay us to allow our =
users to access them.  The application developers would still make money =
by selling the full product, or upgrades to the products.
=20
We are currently in the process of developing our full access site, but =
are at a loss when it comes to the Java OS.  Our programmers are mostly =
versed HTML & Visual Basic.  What I propose is that we arrange a =
partnership between our company and you.  Once it is available from our =
site, you will receive a portion of the revenue collected from the =
developers and advertisers, or some such arrangement.
=20
I hope that you will consider this proposal carefully.

Subject: [JOS-Admin] An idea for increasing the number of code-writers

Hello All;

Sorry for the wide distribution, but, as should become clear from the rest of
this message, we're seeking programming help beyond just the "kernel" group.

In general, I get the feeling that we need to increase the number of people
writing actual code.  I'm sure there are people Out There who want to write
code, but don't know either where or how to jump in.  In specific, as Todd and I
work on jjos+decaf, we sometimes are held up because we have to build some
infrastructure first before building the Java-specific functionality we're
*really* after.

For example, as we think about building some method-lookup machinery for
"built-in" classes, we discovered we could *really* use a good hash-table C++
template.  

If Todd and/or I would put out requests for implementation of reasonably
well-defined pieces of toolsmithing (e.g., "Help! We need a good hashtable
template!"), would anybody Out There be interested in contributing?  

Right now, I can think of two obvious things we need:

(1) The hashtable template, for use with UTF8->function pointer mappings, and

(2) A Boehm-something-or-other derived conservative garbage collector (I can
provide references and pointers to other implementations).

Please reply either to the various lists or to me personally.

Thanks!

-jm

Subject: [JOS-Admin] Announce list?

Hello,

I was working on a new front page for the web site and found that we 
don't have an Announce only mailing list!  Or do we and I just can't find 
it?  Or are we to use Vote-Info? I can see arguements that maybe 
admin or general fill this role but both lists have too much traffic (such 
as this one) that aren't really announcements.

Anyhow, it seems that we really need a separate read-only, low traffic 
announce mailing list.  Only major announcements from "qualified 
people" can post to this list.  People only vaguely interested in JOS 
(such as members of the press) or those that want to "monitor" jos 
without having to deal with any "noise" can use this list to keep tabs on 
JOS.  

Clark.  Can you set this up?  I can't see why there would be any 
objections unless an announce only list already exists and I wanted to 
get this new front page posted to the web asap.  Thanks.

Aha.  I had a feeling we did.  I'm probably on the darn list and 
completely forgot.  Has any traffic been sent on that list lately?  The 
major problem now is, with the current web organization, there is 
absolutely no chance anyone new will find that list and subscribe.  

Clark, would it be feasible to setup an announce@jos.org list in 
mailman?  I think it will be worth the teething pains to force everyone to 
migrate.  Consistency and all that.  The current navbar points everyone 
to the main mailman page for info on mailing lists and there's no 
mention of the annouce group.

Otherwise, how about we edit the mailman pages on jos.org so it at 
least looks like the spin announce list is part of mailman?  On the new 
front page (it hasn't been posted yet), I've created a link to 
jos.org/mailman/listinfo/announce for people interested in subscribing to 
the announce list.  It would be nice if that worked...  I know I'm being 
demanding.  :)

There is an announce only mailing list already, running on
the SPiN servers. I did not know the subscribe information
did vanish. The reason we could not migrate the announce mailing
list to the new mailman lists is that it seems mailman could
not handle the 2000+ subscriptions on the announce list we
already have.

Hello all,

The front page (static page) at www.jos.org and the main wiki page have 
been updated (along with a few small cosmetic changes through out the 
site/wiki).  Please take a look and send comments and feedback either 
to the list or directly to me.  Thanks.
