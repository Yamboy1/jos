LGPL is not my license of choice, either, but for a different reason. I
chose it because it is less restrictive than the GPL and that is
important when other applications will be directly linking to it.
However, as Transvirtual have pointed out with Kaffe, the GPL may be
just as effective in this case. If we define a JOS spec and there are a
number of implementations of it, one LGPL'd and one GPL'd, Java's
dynamic linking allows you to run your program against either of them
without change, so it cannot be said that you are violating the GPL just
because you happen to be running your program with a GPL'd kernel.

As for whether or not JJOS and decaf are incompatible with rheise.os
(which is part LGPL and part GPL), it is an irrelevant issue if we can
convince the courts that rheise.os is not a derivative work of decaf or
vice versa. I'll look into this.

&gt;<i> OTOH, I plan to use classpath or another class
</I>&gt;<i> library for decaf,
</I>
With classpath, it's even less of an issue. Programs that use the
library do not need to be released under the same license. You just need
to make available the source code of the LGPL'd components you are using
under the LGPL.

&gt;<i>         Authors have an implicit copyright to their work.  Your code
</I>&gt;<i> remains your code until you choose to make it otherwise.  (I'm assuming
</I>&gt;<i> we're using American law for now.)
</I>
This is the same for Australian copyright law (which I was just pointing
out to Gilbert in a private discussion). Your work is copyrighted as
soon as it comes into existence. Placing a copyright notice helps inform
people who the copyright owner is. However, placing an incorrect
copyright notice on your work invalidates the copyright (from
memory...).
