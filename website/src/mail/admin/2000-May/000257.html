As a consultant, I write source code for hire. When I create something for
myself, I own it. When I create something for my employer, it is owned by
my employer. A copyright notice makes it clear to everyone involved who
owns the copyright.

I write source code for my own private use. I write source code for
publication. A copyright notice makes it clear that I own the copyright. A
reference to a license makes it clear what copyrights are reserved and/or
granted.

A copyright holder must take appropriate action to protect a claim of
copyright. Publishing without copyright notice is a bad thing. Publishing a
work without copyright notice is inappropriate. It makes it far more
difficult to protect a claim of copyright. Publishing a work without
copyright notice, including the posting on an Internet website or mailing
list, puts a work in the public domain. If it is your intention to publish
a work and make a claim of copyright, a copyright notice is not optional.

-----

JOS Wiki pages have a copyright notice at the bottom for a good reason. The
notice enables a JOS Wiki author to protect their claim of copyright.

Someone should add the year 2000 to its copyright notice. Everything
written since 1 January 2000 is not protected by the copyright notice on
JOS Wiki.
