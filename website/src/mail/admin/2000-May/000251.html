<PRE>Why do so many people have the same misconception about JOS Wiki articles?
What are we doing that encourages this misconception? Time and time again,
I'm told that JOS Wiki articles are out-of-date. Time and time again, I'm
told that they are obsolete. This is a common misconception. Articles
written this week are hardly out-of-date and obsolete. This misconception
keeps coming back, regardless of the dates on articles and on our home page.

What more do people want? They might want to know up-front that the JOS
Project is an on-going research project. It is not a newspaper. It is not
an entertainment site. We are trying to find out more about Java
technologies. We are writing about the things we have discovered so far and
proposals to fix omissions and errors in the Java Virtual Machine
Specification.

Even some of our own members seem to hold these misconceptions. Some
members seem to be unaware of new articles. They are un-informed about the
content of articles and their relevance to the project. It is not easy for
a member to keep everything straight. How do we improve this?

We must start some kind of campaign to set the expectation of our readers.
First, the website is a research site. Articles are written in such a way
that they bring historical perspective. Most of them do not need updating.
Second, we must encourage members of the project to read the articles, too.

We do not have hundreds of people working on a website. I think our primary
mission is to build software that works, not a website. After we have the
software, the website will follow.

I thought we were doing better. Are we? More Wiki articles are
cross-referenced. The glossary is up-to-date. News is announced on our home
page.
