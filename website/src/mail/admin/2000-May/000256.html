<PRE>&gt;<i> As for whether or not JJOS and decaf are incompatible with rheise.os
</I>&gt;<i> (which is part LGPL and part GPL), it is an irrelevant issue if we can
</I>&gt;<i> convince the courts that rheise.os is not a derivative work of decaf or
</I>&gt;<i> vice versa. I'll look into this.
</I>
	Issues like these need to be worried about, but I was mostly
thinking in more general terms, that the fewer licenses we distribute
under, the fewer potential problems there are.  *shrug*  I don't think
that rheise.os is a derivative of decaf -- considering that it doesn't use
any decaf code! -- and if you don't, I'd say we have a pretty good chance,
as the authors in question, of convincing the court of the same. :)

&gt;<i> With classpath, it's even less of an issue. Programs that use the
</I>&gt;<i> library do not need to be released under the same license. You just need
</I>&gt;<i> to make available the source code of the LGPL'd components you are using
</I>&gt;<i> under the LGPL.
</I>
	I know -- I was just noting this to say that we'd have at /least/
two licenses in the JOS distribution, so worrying about differenent
licenses may be counter-productive.
