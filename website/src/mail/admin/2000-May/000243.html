<PRE>to-do list:
	
	* Alias cvs.jos.org to cvs.jos.sourceforge.net.  cvs.jos.org is up
and steady at SourceForge; I'll be turning ACLs on for the whole CVS in
the next few days.

	* Alias lists.jos.org to jos.org, since people seem to be
expecting it.  Helmut's machine is running mailman beautifully, and he
doesn't seem to mind.  (BTW, is spin.de still sponsoring our mailing
lists, as we claim on our site?)  If his machine goes down, we can't do
redirects anyway, so it's not something we need to worry about.  If we
outgrow his machine, I imagine we could change the jos.org root DNS entry
:<i>)
</I>
	* Alias ftp.jos.org to jos.sourceforge.net; even if we don't need
it, we may as well have an alias in place.  If it comes to that, we can
always just have it point people to the proper mirror
sites.  (e.g. cdrom.com)

	AFAIK, we don't have any active links to ftp.jos.org, so we don't
need to make any website changes once it goes active.  Once the CVS
redirect goes active, we will have to update the CVS links in the site to
use cvs.jos.org.  W.r.t. to lists.jos.org, just start using it :)  If
mailman doesn't automagically adjust to the new hostname/redirect,
changing it shouldn't be too hard.

	* Alias wiki.jos.org to jos.sourceforge.net, which will be running
sfWiki, once it's done.  It's currently running an alpha version that's
not up to replacing the wiki running at metamech.  
(<A HREF="http://jos.sourceforge.net/wiki.php3">http://jos.sourceforge.net/wiki.php3</A>)  If won't be worth the trouble to
add this alias/redirect with this others if it just has to be redone,
don't bother.

Two status items:

	* planned backups: 

cvs.jos.org -- Clark's box.
wiki.jos.org -- Clark's box.
lists.jos.org -- none or Clark's box; see above
ftp.jos.org -- Clarks' box, or a mirror site, if it comes to that.
www.jos.org -- SourceForge.

All of these backups will require cron jobs running on Clark's box to keep
the backups up-to-date, but that shouldn't be a problem.  To-do list
w.r.t. to this is setting up his box.  I'll volunteer for this when I have
the time.  (Hopefully before June.)

	* www.jos.org is running fine as it as at Helmut's machine.  No
need for changes.
