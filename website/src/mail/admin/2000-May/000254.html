<PRE>&gt;<i> We should help other members of the JOS project to protect their copyright
</I>&gt;<i> and distribute under a open source and free software license. There are
</I>&gt;<i> additional guidelines for publishing source code under the GPL and LGPL.
</I>&gt;<i> The LGPL enables a commercial vendor to redistribute your product without
</I>&gt;<i> an additional license. The GPL requires a commercial vendor to negotiate an
</I>&gt;<i> additional license, and possibly a license fee.
</I>
	While we should help other members with this issue, I'm not sure
that the (L)GPL ought to be the license of choice, especially as the
license JM released JJOS under ( and which I adopted for decaf ) may not
be compatible with them.  OTOH, I plan to use classpath or another class
library for decaf, which we will be redistributing under its license, so
some license fragementation is necessary, unless JM and I agree to
relicense our code.  I have not spent enough time reviewing better-known
licenses to see how well they match the JJOS license, so I'm not sure as
to which, if any, it may be switched.

&gt;<i> Without a copyright notice, your source code file (.java) becomes part of
</I>&gt;<i> the public domain. As public domain software, others can redistribute it
</I>&gt;<i> and redistribute a modified version, too. You lose control of the software
</I>&gt;<i> you write.
</I>
	Authors have an implicit copyright to their work.  Your code
remains your code until you choose to make it otherwise.  (I'm assuming
we're using American law for now.)  It may be the opinion of the legal
system that by distributing your code in certain fashions, you have
implicitly entered it into the public domain, but it can not be the
general case that distributing a work without a copyright notice enters it
into the public domain.  Certainly, for instance, I retain rights to my
posts on slashdot, even without a copyright notice.  On the other hand, it
can't hurt to be careful.
