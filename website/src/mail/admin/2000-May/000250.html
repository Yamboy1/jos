<PRE>&gt;<i> This reminds me. I was looking at the issues with setting up ACLs within
</I>&gt;<i> CVS and I think it's not such a good idea to make the avail file
</I>&gt;<i> editable through CVS itself. I did figure out a way of preventing
</I>&gt;<i> certain users from ever being deleted, but the problem is that by making
</I>&gt;<i> it version controlled, anonymous users will be able to read the avail
</I>&gt;<i> file. This is a security hole because it gives crackers target accounts
</I>&gt;<i> to break into.
</I>
	The problem is that we don't have ssh access to the box CVS is
running on; that's part of the reason it took so long to get ACLs working
at all -- the perl script, with correct permissions, had to be added to
the checkoutlist in order to show up on the server in a non-versioned
form.  The same for avail.  (I blew each of them once and had to wait
for the SF admins to fix it.)  It may be possible to rewrite the cvs_acls
script to use ssh and read avail from some non-public directory at
sfwiki.sourceforge.net, but then that account's username/passwd would be
in the cvs_acls file, which is /also/ in the anonymous CVS.  Similar
problems exist for any secured method, I think.

	I don't think, however, that having a list of usernames available
is that much of a concern to the SF admins; the list of developers
(e.g. those who can log into the cvs machine in the first place, with or
without a later ACL phase) is already public at
