The list looks good.  Who's going to do all this aliasing. I assume it 
has to be helmut?

&gt;<i> doesn't seem to mind.  (BTW, is spin.de still sponsoring our mailing

Yes.  Officially the announce list is still hosted at spin and all our 
archives from the original lists are there too.  However, I don't know 
who has post permissions to the announce list (I don't have 
permission) so I don't know if the list can even be used any more.  
I'd like to migrate the announce list to mailman on helmut's 
machine at some point so we can finish with spin (after grabbing 
the archives) and at least eliminate one inconsistency in our setup. 
Plus, I bet most people don't even know about the official announce 
list on spin because its separate from all the other lists...
