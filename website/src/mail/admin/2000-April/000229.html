Helmut, the only problem that I've had with 
you currently and in the past is that you usually 
frame your e-mail in a derogatory manner; implying
that the deveopers in JOS are not adequite
programmers.  This is poor behavior; not that I've
acted much better... but it insites a hostile response
from me no matter what your message may be.

We use cvsweb.cgi (a perl front end to 
the cvs system which is written in c)
and wiki.cgi since the jos people are 
primarly concerned with building a java 
operating system... not a working environment 
for an interactive group. They are two entirely
different domains.  So; certainly 
you have a right to be upset about
perl scripts which go-wacko; but please
understand, we didn't write them for
the most part; and if we did, they are
of secondary concern... quick hacks.  
We are using what ever we can to keep
the project moving.  This is our focus.

As for mailman, it uses python, you had
mentioned &quot;python&quot; showing up high on your
&quot;top&quot; list... if this is a problem; then I'm
sure we can move.  I have mailman working
on my home box (DSL); so perhaps that 
coudl be the JOS.ORG MX.  However, IMHO,
Python is alot better than perl...

Best Wishes,

Clark
