Which is exactly why it's potentially dangerous. If you add someone to
that ACL, they can delete you. We could edit the cvs_acls.pl script to
define a set of users that cannot be deleted from this acl. I'll
experiment with it...

I found I was able to login to jos.sourceforge.net via ssh. When I
uploaded the old cvs files to the ftp area they didn't have the same
permissions as yours so I _had_ too ssh in to fix it. It seems your
test.txt file was automatically assigned to the &quot;jos&quot; group while mine
wasn't.
