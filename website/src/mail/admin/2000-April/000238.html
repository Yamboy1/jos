I'd prefer not pointing it at metamech.com since my hosting 
company changes $20 to setup the aliases.  So lets point it at 
Clark's box.  I'm not sure about hosting the wiki on SourceForge 
anytime in the near future for two reasons:
1) it will suffer from the same problems that makes Helmut kick us 
off every quarter or so... highly experimental code with long periods 
of neglect.
2) tweaking and adjusting code running on SourceForge's http 
server is a major pain (at least for me).  I can't use their ssh file 
transfer program so I'd have to hand edit everything over ssh.

So I vote for making clark's machine the main wiki server.  Plus, we 
can tweak it freely and not worry so much about security breaches 
getting us in major trouble...

&gt;<i> &gt; 	lists.jos.org: should point at Helmut's machine.  Currently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unaliased.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or mailman could be setup on cantor.clarkevans.com if helmut

</I>
Why not point it at sourceforge and use their mailman setup?

&gt;<i> &gt; 	ftp.jos.org: Does not seem to allow anonymous access?  (Helmut, am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I doing something horribly wrong, or is that the case?)  Currently points
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at Helmut's machine; could be redirected to jos.sourceforge.net if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hemut's suggestion about using tarballs with an http link
</I>&gt;<i> should work... thoughts?
</I>
I like it.  True ftp sites like cdrom.com, download.com, or some 
other personal sites can mirror our stuff for ftp functionality if it 
becomes an issue.

&gt;<i> &gt; 	Regarding backups: most things are up in the air.  First, ftp
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; backup -- if we have to move our primary to jos.sourceforge.net, it can no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; longer serve as a backup.  Second, CVS &amp; CVSweb.  Right now, we don't have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a backup plan in case disaster strikes at sourceforge, unless/until Clark
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sets them up on his new box.  (Clark, how is that coming along?) 
</I>
Not sure this is a problem.  sourceforge does backups and 
monitors for crashes.  They'll automatically backup from tape on 
disaster or backup on request (I think they keep a week's worth).  
So we really need to only backup the CVS tarball once a week.  I 
don't think we really need an active backup CVS and CVSweb 
system running...

I think this can either be cron job or simply ask someone to do this 
as a weekly task.  Anyone with a CDR can burn quarterly copies 
and archive it in a safe somewhere to be really paranoid.

I'm going to be absolutely swamped from now until at least June 
with possibly a break here and there.  So if I take it, its going to be 
stop and go (with a lot of stop until mid may).

So perhaps Todd better take it.  Or I guess we both can...  I would 
anticipate the two of us could work together without problems.

&gt;<i> Then, we could write a shell script that tars up
</I>&gt;<i> each box (cvs,mail,http,wiki) and ftps a copy
</I>&gt;<i> over to my box.  This could even be done as
</I>&gt;<i> a cron job... say 2am EST.
</I>
Yup.

&gt;<i> &gt; Mailing-list wise, sourceforge will provide them, but their names will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different, all prefixed with &quot;jos-&quot;; I don't see any way around this.  
</I>
Yeah, but can't we &quot;invisibly&quot; alias the lists?  So email to 
<A HREF="mailto:admin@jos.org">admin@jos.org</A> goes to helmut's machine, gets automaticaly 
forwarded to <A HREF="mailto:jos-admin@listst.sourceforge.net">jos-admin@listst.sourceforge.net</A> and hits the list 
normally....

&gt;<i> &gt; (That means it would probably be better to have Clark's machine handle the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mailing list backups.)  Fourth, a wiki backup.  This could also be run on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Clark's machine; as a PHP program, it shouldn't cause stability problems.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Helmut -- does dearwebby already run mySQL/PHP?  (I understand that it's a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bear to set up.)  What we can do w.r.t. backups right away is copy
</I>
It is not setup.  Helmut does not want MySQL on his machine (he 
suggests we use a commercial db) and was highly opposed to 
putting PHP on his machine as well.  I'd say any active pages of 
any sort should be kept off Helmut's machine until they are 
absolutely bulletproofed and coded in C.  We've killed his box and 
pissed him off enough.

&gt;<i> &gt; the static stuff from Helmut's machine to the sourceforge site and request
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a tarball of the current CVS archive, should we need to put it elsewhere.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes; I suppose that the box I have could be setup
</I>&gt;<i> as a backup of all of the other boxes.  It has 2 hard
</I>&gt;<i> drives; another cron job could be setup during the
</I>&gt;<i> day to replicate one drive to the other.
</I>
The tarballs are posted automatically I think.  I'm still unconvinced 
that we'll need a running backup of the CVS on another machine...  
i think just storing tarball archives is enough.
