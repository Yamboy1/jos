<PRE>OK.

If this needs to happen by this weekend, we need to do triage.

1) Website.  Well, who owns the jos.org name?  I assume we'll 
need cooperation to redirect the name to another machine.  For the 
moment, I'd say we should point it to your (Clark's) machine that 
already hosts wiki.jos.org and temporarily just relocate the 
index.html page, or redirect to my server (www.metamech.com).  
Since most everything is in wiki and its hosted in metamech the 
website is pretty unaffected (other than the home page) by the 
move.  If helmut is bowing out and is the official point of contact for 
the jos.org name, we should have an active member gain 
&quot;ownership&quot; of the jos.org name (internic entry).

2) Mailing lists.  We can use the sourceforge mailman services to 
take over mailing lists.  The only trick is having the jos.org machine 
forward mailing list traffic to the appropriate sourceforge mailman 
email addresses.  I don't have much time to do this this weekend 
so unless someone else is willing to do this, I think mailing lists 
will just have to be shutdown for at least this weekend.  I can work 
on this next week.

3) CVS.  We've already started moving the core kernel code into 
the sourceforge cvs server.  I say we simply shutdown the jos.org 
cvs.  Any references to the jos.org cvs server needs to be updated 
to point to the sourceforge cvs.  Kernel code goes into sourceforge 
(Todd &quot;_quinn&quot; is taking care of this).  Other subprojects will have 
to open up new sourceforge accounts and check their sources into 
those sourceforge project cvs repositories.  We'll have to 
coordinate to get the webpages to tie the sub-projects back 
together...

Am I missing anything?
