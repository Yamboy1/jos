<PRE>I agree with Ian. Since you got a working cvs on sourceforge,
and since the cvs on jos.org is probably way too flakey to be
worth trying to fix it, the only reasonable solution is to move
it's content to the working cvs.

Any scripts that are a potential embarrassment should not be
on a multi client server. You can't expect dozens of people who
each PAY for 200 to 500 GIG traffic and high reliability to just
ignore it when ONE non-commercial client denies service to
everybody else with flakey and sloppy code.

And that is exactly what happened yesterday.
/sites/jos/www/cvsweb.cgi  performed a Denial Of Service
attack from the inside out and denied service to many
thousands of visitors to the sites of over a hundred clients.

NOBODY can be allowed to do that on a multi-client server.
Scripts like that belong on home machines, not public servers.

Jos.org should carry the public information and be the central
index or gateway to the different home machines that use
potentially embarrassing scripts.

</I>&gt;<i>moment, I'd say we should point it to your (Clark's) machine that

</I>&gt;<i>Since most everything is in wiki and its hosted in metamech the

</I>&gt;<i>move.  If helmut is bowing out and is the official point of contact for
</I>&gt;<i>the jos.org name, we should have an active member gain
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;ownership&quot; of the jos.org name (internic entry).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2) Mailing lists.  We can use the sourceforge mailman services to
</I>&gt;<i>take over mailing lists.  The only trick is having the jos.org machine
</I>&gt;<i>forward mailing list traffic to the appropriate sourceforge mailman
</I>&gt;<i>email addresses.  I don't have much time to do this this weekend
</I>&gt;<i>so unless someone else is willing to do this, I think mailing lists
</I>&gt;<i>will just have to be shutdown for at least this weekend.  I can work
</I>&gt;<i>on this next week.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>3) CVS.  We've already started moving the core kernel code into
</I>&gt;<i>the sourceforge cvs server.  I say we simply shutdown the jos.org
</I>&gt;<i>cvs.  Any references to the jos.org cvs server needs to be updated
</I>&gt;<i>to point to the sourceforge cvs.  Kernel code goes into sourceforge
</I>&gt;<i>(Todd &quot;_quinn&quot; is taking care of this).  Other subprojects will have
</I>&gt;<i>to open up new sourceforge accounts and check their sources into
</I>&gt;<i>those sourceforge project cvs repositories.  We'll have to
</I>&gt;<i>coordinate to get the webpages to tie the sub-projects back
</I>&gt;<i>together...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Am I missing anything?
