<PRE>&gt;<i> 1) Website.  Well, who owns the jos.org name? 
</I>
Currently Helmut is the legal owner of the name.  

Helmut, what exactly do you require for ownership
to be transfered; I tried last year (I went through
all the effort to setup an LLC and everything), but 
I did not meet your requirements.

&gt;<i> I assume we'll need cooperation to redirect the 
</I>&gt;<i> name to another machine. 
</I>
I hope so.

&gt;<i> For the  moment, I'd say we should point it to your (Clark's) 
</I>&gt;<i> machine that already hosts wiki.jos.org and temporarily just 
</I>&gt;<i> relocate the index.html page, or redirect to my server (www.metamech.com).
</I>
Perhaps re-directing to your server would be better...
  
&gt;<i> Since most everything is in wiki and its hosted in metamech the 
</I>&gt;<i> website is pretty unaffected (other than the home page) by the 
</I>&gt;<i> move.  If helmut is bowing out and is the official point of contact for 
</I>&gt;<i> the jos.org name, we should have an active member gain 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ownership&quot; of the jos.org name (internic entry).
</I>
This makes sense to me.
 
&gt;<i> 2) Mailing lists.  We can use the sourceforge mailman services to 
</I>&gt;<i> take over mailing lists.  The only trick is having the jos.org machine 
</I>&gt;<i> forward mailing list traffic to the appropriate sourceforge mailman 
</I>&gt;<i> email addresses.  I don't have much time to do this this weekend 
</I>&gt;<i> so unless someone else is willing to do this, I think mailing lists 
</I>&gt;<i> will just have to be shutdown for at least this weekend.  I can work 
</I>&gt;<i> on this next week.
</I>
Well, if it was setup at my box; I could have the forwarding
take place. 

&gt;<i> 3) CVS.  We've already started moving the core kernel code into 
</I>&gt;<i> the sourceforge cvs server.  I say we simply shutdown the jos.org 
</I>&gt;<i> cvs. 
</I>
I belive that it is already shut down.

&gt;<i> Any references to the jos.org cvs server needs to be updated 
</I>&gt;<i> to point to the sourceforge cvs.  Kernel code goes into sourceforge 
</I>&gt;<i> (Todd &quot;_quinn&quot; is taking care of this).  Other subprojects will have 
</I>&gt;<i> to open up new sourceforge accounts and check their sources into 
</I>&gt;<i> those sourceforge project cvs repositories.  We'll have to 
</I>&gt;<i> coordinate to get the webpages to tie the sub-projects back 
</I>&gt;<i> together...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Am I missing anything?
</I>
I think you got the bulk of it.

Sorry once again,

Clark
