Sure.  Point wiki.jos.org to metatech.com.  Alternatively, Iain,
you can have the root password to the box here (cantor.clarkevans.com)
and set it up as you please.  In either case, the DNS entry
needs to be changed once again...

I'm sure Helmut can add this entry.

</I>&gt;<i> unaliased.

Or mailman could be setup on cantor.clarkevans.com if helmut
has a probem with python running on his box.

</I>&gt;<i> necessary.
</I>
Hemut's suggestion about using tarballs with an http link
should work... thoughts?

&gt;<i> 	www.jos.org: running beautifully, pointing at Helmut's machine.
</I>
Cool.

&gt;<i> 	Regarding backups: most things are up in the air.  First, ftp
</I>&gt;<i> backup -- if we have to move our primary to jos.sourceforge.net, it can no
</I>&gt;<i> longer serve as a backup.  Second, CVS &amp; CVSweb.  Right now, we don't have
</I>&gt;<i> a backup plan in case disaster strikes at sourceforge, unless/until Clark
</I>&gt;<i> sets them up on his new box.  (Clark, how is that coming along?) 
</I>
I have backed up the items I need from that box onto 
another box.  If someone wants the passwd and take
ownership of it great.... otherwise I could easily
setup an ftp account on one of the boxes.  

Then, we could write a shell script that tars up
each box (cvs,mail,http,wiki) and ftps a copy
over to my box.  This could even be done as
a cron job... say 2am EST.

 
&gt;<i> Mailing-list wise, sourceforge will provide them, but their names will be
</I>&gt;<i> different, all prefixed with &quot;jos-&quot;; I don't see any way around this.  
</I>&gt;<i> (That means it would probably be better to have Clark's machine handle the
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list backups.)  Fourth, a wiki backup.  This could also be run on
</I>&gt;<i> Clark's machine; as a PHP program, it shouldn't cause stability problems.  
</I>&gt;<i> Helmut -- does dearwebby already run mySQL/PHP?  (I understand that it's a
</I>&gt;<i> bear to set up.)  What we can do w.r.t. backups right away is copy
</I>&gt;<i> the static stuff from Helmut's machine to the sourceforge site and request
</I>&gt;<i> a tarball of the current CVS archive, should we need to put it elsewhere.
</I>
Yes; I suppose that the box I have could be setup
as a backup of all of the other boxes.  It has 2 hard
drives; another cron job could be setup during the
day to replicate one drive to the other.

Clark
