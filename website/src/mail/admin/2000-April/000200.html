If you mean the anonymous FTP area, I don't seem to have write access to
it.

Is it possible to restrict CVS write access for each developer to
different directories, as I was doing on jos.org?

Exactly. The &quot;java&quot; module would be the directory containing the top
level java package names.

&gt;<i> yet.)  If you want more priviliges on a particular part of the site
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. bugtracking, forums, task manager, patch manager, or support

</I>
I'll have to read up on what these are before I know if I need them.
patch manager sounds interesting. I'd like to know if there is a way to
manage restricting CVS write access to certain subdirectories (as I
described above).

Thanks.
