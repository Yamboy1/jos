<PRE>&gt;<i> 1) it will suffer from the same problems that makes Helmut kick us 
</I>&gt;<i> off every quarter or so... highly experimental code with long periods 
</I>&gt;<i> of neglect.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) tweaking and adjusting code running on SourceForge's http 
</I>&gt;<i> server is a major pain (at least for me).  I can't use their ssh file 
</I>&gt;<i> transfer program so I'd have to hand edit everything over ssh.
</I>
	scp doesn't work for you?  Strange.  (Are you using openssh?)  I'm
not dead-set on running the wiki on SourceForge's servers, but my
understanding was the experimental PHP wouldn't be as much a problem as
experimental perl; the other advantage being, of course, that they take
care of a good bit of the administration for us.  OTOH, since our wiki
isn't getting an enourmous number of hits (that I'm aware of), clark's box
would work just fine.

&gt;<i> Why not point it at sourceforge and use their mailman setup?
</I>
	The jos-* prefixing means we'd have to do address aliasing if we
don't want to change anything, and we lose continuity in the
archives.  Helmut doesn't seem to mind mailman, so I don't see any reason
to inconvenience ourselves to move it.

&gt;<i> I like it.  True ftp sites like cdrom.com, download.com, or some 
</I>&gt;<i> other personal sites can mirror our stuff for ftp functionality if it 
</I>&gt;<i> becomes an issue.
</I>
	Very true.  Let's go with it, then.

&gt;<i> I think this can either be cron job or simply ask someone to do this 
</I>&gt;<i> as a weekly task.  Anyone with a CDR can burn quarterly copies 
</I>&gt;<i> and archive it in a safe somewhere to be really paranoid.
</I>
	I've got one of those :)

&gt;<i> So perhaps Todd better take it.  Or I guess we both can...  I would 
</I>&gt;<i> anticipate the two of us could work together without problems.
</I>
	Ditto.  I'll be very busy for the next two weeks or so, then have
a nice two-week vacation.  After that, I should have more free time.

&gt;<i> Yeah, but can't we &quot;invisibly&quot; alias the lists?  So email to 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="mailto:admin@jos.org">admin@jos.org</A> goes to helmut's machine, gets automaticaly 
</I>&gt;<i> forwarded to <A HREF="mailto:jos-admin@listst.sourceforge.net">jos-admin@listst.sourceforge.net</A> and hits the list 
</I>&gt;<i> normally....
</I>
	*shrug*  Then we're still dependent on Helmut's machine being up,
which defeats the point of migrating the lists to SourceForge.  (Although
I guess we could always manually adjust our headers until his server came
back up.)

&gt;<i> It is not setup.  Helmut does not want MySQL on his machine (he 
</I>&gt;<i> suggests we use a commercial db) and was highly opposed to 
</I>&gt;<i> putting PHP on his machine as well.  I'd say any active pages of 
</I>&gt;<i> any sort should be kept off Helmut's machine until they are 
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely bulletproofed and coded in C.  We've killed his box and 
</I>&gt;<i> pissed him off enough.
</I>
	This is probably very wise.  I'll just shut up now and go hack :)

&gt;<i> The tarballs are posted automatically I think.  I'm still unconvinced 
</I>&gt;<i> that we'll need a running backup of the CVS on another machine...  
</I>&gt;<i> i think just storing tarball archives is enough.
</I>
	As long as we have a plan for setting one up if we need it.

Summary?

	current plan:

cvs.jos.org -- at SourceForge
wiki.jos.org -- at clark's box
lists.jos.org -- at Helmut's box, which may redirect them to
	SourceForge lists.  (awaiting commentary)
ftp.jos.org -- unecessary for now.  Redirect to sourceforge anyway? (just
	so something will be there)
www.jos.org -- Helmut's machine

	backups:

cvs.jos.org -- none for now; could run on Clark's box.  keep CVS tarballs
	archived to Clark's box with a cron job.
wiki.jos.org -- none for now; me and Iain are discussing what to do with
	the wiki -- if we get clark's box, running the enhydra application
	server and doing the whole thing in Java.  We lean on SourceForge
	(nicely!) to handle servelets when they get stable.
lists.jos.org -- the other of whichever server ends up handling them
	now, or Clark's box.
ftp.jos.org -- since we don't really need it, none at all -- redirects
	to ftp.cdrom.com (et al) if/when we ever do.
www.jos.org -- SourceForge
