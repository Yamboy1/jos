Well, I'm on windows.  I found and am using some scp program but 
it keeps crapping out on me.

The PHP version would consume much less resources.  And it 
would be nice for SourceForge to handle admin of the site 
infrastructure (server, patches, etc).  I'm just concerned that 
experimental code will cause problems...  Our wiki is getting pretty 
low traffic so I'm pretty sure any box will work.  I'd feel safer 
working in a sandbox like clark's box at first.

&gt;<i> &gt; Why not point it at sourceforge and use their mailman setup?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	The jos-* prefixing means we'd have to do address aliasing if we
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to change anything, and we lose continuity in the
</I>&gt;<i> archives.  Helmut doesn't seem to mind mailman, so I don't see any reason
</I>&gt;<i> to inconvenience ourselves to move it.
</I>
Agreed that we should keep mailman where it is for now.  But it 
usually craps out every once in a while and clark has to upgrade 
us.  Next time that happens, I would suggest just &quot;moving&quot; it by 
forwarding <A HREF="mailto:listname@jos.org">listname@jos.org</A> to the sourceforge list addresses.  As 
far as archives, like I said before, we really should get a snap shot 
from spin and jos.org, generate static archive web pages, and put it 
on our website.  

&gt;<i> &gt; So perhaps Todd better take it.  Or I guess we both can...  I would 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anticipate the two of us could work together without problems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Ditto.  I'll be very busy for the next two weeks or so, then have
</I>&gt;<i> a nice two-week vacation.  After that, I should have more free time.
</I>
Cool.  I guess when either of us is ready to start work, we'll contact 
Clark...

&gt;<i> &gt; Yeah, but can't we &quot;invisibly&quot; alias the lists?  So email to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="mailto:admin@jos.org">admin@jos.org</A> goes to helmut's machine, gets automaticaly 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forwarded to <A HREF="mailto:jos-admin@listst.sourceforge.net">jos-admin@listst.sourceforge.net</A> and hits the list 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; normally....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	*shrug*  Then we're still dependent on Helmut's machine being up,
</I>&gt;<i> which defeats the point of migrating the lists to SourceForge.  (Although
</I>&gt;<i> I guess we could always manually adjust our headers until his server came
</I>&gt;<i> back up.)
</I>
Helmut's machine uptime has never been a problem.  In fact its 
quite stable because Helmut maintains his machines as a job so 
any problems are fixed in minutes.  So things like mail 
forwarding/aliasing on helmut's machine will work... pretty much 
guaranteed.  It's only the custom apps running on helmut's 
machine that's a concern for two reasons:

1) when one runs amok, it pisses helmut off and he kills the app 
(e.g. wiki, cvs_web)

2) we have to fix, update, upgrade the app (like mailman) which is 
always a low priority for us.

&gt;<i> 	current plan:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> cvs.jos.org -- at SourceForge
</I>&gt;<i> wiki.jos.org -- at clark's box
</I>&gt;<i> lists.jos.org -- at Helmut's box, which may redirect them to
</I>&gt;<i> 	SourceForge lists.  (awaiting commentary)
</I>
Remains at helmut's box until there are problems or someone has 
time.  Then consider and implement a migration to sourceforge.
&gt;<i> ftp.jos.org -- unecessary for now.  Redirect to sourceforge anyway? (just
</I>&gt;<i> 	so something will be there)
</I>
Sounds good.

&gt;<i> www.jos.org -- Helmut's machine
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	backups:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> cvs.jos.org -- none for now; could run on Clark's box.  keep CVS tarballs
</I>&gt;<i> 	archived to Clark's box with a cron job.
</I>&gt;<i> wiki.jos.org -- none for now; me and Iain are discussing what to do with
</I>&gt;<i> 	the wiki -- if we get clark's box, running the enhydra application
</I>&gt;<i> 	server and doing the whole thing in Java.  We lean on SourceForge
</I>&gt;<i> 	(nicely!) to handle servelets when they get stable.
</I>&gt;<i> lists.jos.org -- the other of whichever server ends up handling them
</I>&gt;<i> 	now, or Clark's box.
</I>&gt;<i> ftp.jos.org -- since we don't really need it, none at all -- redirects
</I>&gt;<i> 	to ftp.cdrom.com (et al) if/when we ever do.
</I>&gt;<i> www.jos.org -- SourceForge
</I>
I second the motion.
