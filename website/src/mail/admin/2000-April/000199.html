<PRE>&gt;<i> Any objections?
</I>
	No.  Also, while you may want to write the current CVS tarball
into our storage space at sourceforge -- so we won't lose the code! -- we
may want to wait on adding inactive trees to the active CVS.

&gt;<i> Also, _quinn, I have created myself an account on sourceforge. I suspect
</I>&gt;<i> I'll need to be made a JOS admin on sourceforge in order to be helpful
</I>&gt;<i> here. Is that do-able?
</I>
	Actually, administator priviliges are separate from CVS write
priviliges, which you now have.  (Enjoy!)  The CVSROOT, BTW, is
&quot;/cvsroot/jos&quot;, so when doing the imports, import from the directory above
the import and with a module name of that directory.  (For practice, there
/is/ a 'test' directory toplevel in the CVS (along with JJOS).)  I don't
object to having 'jos'-prefixed paths, but it does seem rather redundant
-- unless the project is supposed to go in the jos namespace, perhaps.

	If you need add'l stuff done, talk to me or Iain.  (Both of us
have to approve of you becoming and admin, and haven't heard from him
yet.)  If you want more priviliges on a particular part of the site
(e.g. bugtracking, forums, task manager, patch manager, or support
manager), let me know; I don't think Iain would object.
