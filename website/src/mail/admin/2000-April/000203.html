It still says permission denied. I guess it's because the cron system
hasn't copied across my password information yet.

The way I set it up, avail was not being version controlled by CVS so it
wasn't technically part of the CVSROOT module. That was just a security
measure. It looks like the file can be added to CVS and the plain text
file will be generated automatically, meaning that if we wanted to we
could administor the avail file through CVS. We just need to make sure
only one or two people have write access to this file!

Editing it through shell access would be more secure, though. Do I have
permission to log in and edit CVSROOT files using ssh? I wouldn't know
since even scp doesn't work for me yet.

&gt;<i> Unfortunately, when I tried it, it didn't work at all;

</I>
Yes, cvs_acls.pl is distributed with CVS in the contrib directory.
