<PRE>Hi Ian

All we did was chmod cvsweb.cgi to be non executable and announce that we 
can not risk  to have that one flakey script running amok again during the 
Easter rush and that that ONE file will remain turned off till after the 
Easter rush, and that we hoped it will be fixed or replaced by then. No 
other file was touched by us.

Setting things up like a proper development environment with the Sun for 
the gateway and central back-up, and disposables for experimental and 
potentially embarrassing stuff, that was just a recommendation.

Especially until wiki and cvs can be upgraded to C, it would be best if 
they each were on separate PC's, so that neither of those two can lock out 
the other one. In time any number of PC's can be added as satellite 
machines and accessed from the gateway like subdirectories.

FTP is absolutely no problem and never has been.

With the mailman, as long as there are no tangled loops, there is no 
problem. As far as I know there have not been any of those for a couple of 
years.
