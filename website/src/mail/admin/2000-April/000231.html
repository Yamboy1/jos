<PRE>	wiki.jos.org: should currently point at www.metamech.com; will
eventually point to something on a SourceForge server, once we (Iain
and/or I) get PHP wiki running.  For some reason, it looks like this
currently points at &quot;appletreedesign.com&quot;.  (Huh?)

	cvs.jos.org: should point at cvs.jos.sourceforge.net.  Though the
links on the default project page don't point here for CVSweb, they seem
to work just fine.  Currently unaliased.
(cvs.jos.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/JJOS/?cvsroot=jos)

	lists.jos.org: should point at Helmut's machine.  Currently
unaliased.

	ftp.jos.org: Does not seem to allow anonymous access?  (Helmut, am
I doing something horribly wrong, or is that the case?)  Currently points
at Helmut's machine; could be redirected to jos.sourceforge.net if
necessary.

	www.jos.org: running beautifully, pointing at Helmut's machine.


	Action summary: wiki.jos.org needs to be corrected; cvs and
lists .jos.org need to be created.  Question about ftp.jos.org needs to
be resolved.

	Regarding backups: most things are up in the air.  First, ftp
backup -- if we have to move our primary to jos.sourceforge.net, it can no
longer serve as a backup.  Second, CVS &amp; CVSweb.  Right now, we don't have
a backup plan in case disaster strikes at sourceforge, unless/until Clark
sets them up on his new box.  (Clark, how is that coming along?)  
Mailing-list wise, sourceforge will provide them, but their names will be
different, all prefixed with &quot;jos-&quot;; I don't see any way around this.  
(That means it would probably be better to have Clark's machine handle the
mailing list backups.)  Fourth, a wiki backup.  This could also be run on
Clark's machine; as a PHP program, it shouldn't cause stability problems.  
Helmut -- does dearwebby already run mySQL/PHP?  (I understand that it's a
bear to set up.)  What we can do w.r.t. backups right away is copy
the static stuff from Helmut's machine to the sourceforge site and request
a tarball of the current CVS archive, should we need to put it elsewhere.

	Feedback?
