<PRE>Clark, you are full of shit !
YOU are the one using static web pages,  and flakey PERL code.

The grown-ups use dynamic web pages that are generated by SSI or by fast
and clean C code. Look at any of the card sites on any of our machines !
All you see is templates, compact C programs, thousands of image files and
millions of little data files. Lots of disk access without ANY problem.

The problem was NOT drive access, but ONE flakey program hogging RAM
and processes. I have suggested to you for years to find a programmer and
get that ancient stuff ported to C where you have proper error checking
routines built in.

I have NEVER discouraged the use of executables. We are one of the few
places that allow executables outside of a baby-pen or cgi-bin.
We probably have the highest rate of active executables per domain of any
high traffic web host.

We have always encouraged the use of executables, but we can't allow
sloppy code from ONE domain denying access to everybody else.
