<PRE>Hello all,

Sorry for the lack of communication.  I'm really swamped.  

OK, the main crises is that helmut wants cvs off his machine 
NOW.  This has already been accomplished since helmut has shut 
down csv_web on his machine (and I assume cvs as well).

The kernel sources have been moved to sourceforge.net so go 
there for the latest cvs.  All other sources are available via Gilbert's 
jos distribution.  CVS for these projects should be checked into 
separate sourceforge projects for now.  We'll worry about re-
integration later.

Mailman.  Helmut, I assume we can leave this running on your 
machine at least for this weekend?  If so we'll do that.  Then, when 
people have time, we should activate the sourceforge mailman 
service and alias the mailing list email addresses to the 
sourceforge mailing list addresses.  Users should see no difference 
except the list admin pages are on sourceforge and the archives 
will start showing up in sourceforge.  We should make a static 
archive of the spin.de and current mailman archives on helmut's 
machine and post them to the jos static site to keep the rest of the 
list archives available.

ftp.  we'll continue using helmut's machine for this purpose for now 
(if that's alright with helmut).

I agree that the machine naming should be improved asap to make 
these infrastructure changes invisible to end users.

I'd like to get it off metamech at some time.  The wiki is not very 
nice as is.  Right now its leaking about 20-25 MB of error logs a 
month because of some very minor perl code errors (probably due 
to my hacking to get it to behave).

Since its so finicky, I think migrating it to a separate box that won't 
hurt anyone other than itself is a Very Good Idea (tm).

Yup.

This sounds good.  Although, there really is nothing to the static 
web serving (a single page) so I see no reason to phyiscally 
separate it from the wiki machine.  The FTP machine on the other 
hand should be a separate machine (and mirrored if possible).

I would actually suggest moving this to sourceforge.  They are 
using mailman and are paying someone to maintain the 
installation.  It basically offloads this responsibility from any jos 
member (I'm totally for less work).  It should be easy to alias the 
present list addresses to work seamlessly with the sourceforge 
hosted lists.  Plus, one less machine for us to worry about.

</I>
Well, sourceforge handles most shortterm backups, so we only 
need to do &quot;golden&quot; backups.  Probably safest if we just ask some 
members to grab certain daily backups say once a month and burn 
it onto a cdr and store it somewhere.

Yes.  I've already ported wiki to PHP which works about 10 times 
faster, and has a bunch of new features (including search!).  Just 
haven't had time to roll it out.  And won't until late may.  If someone 
wants to take my (very ugly) code and try and get it running now, 
you're welcome.  Otherwise, I say we keep the perl version limping 
along until I have time in may to upgrade the wiki.  I agree we 
should move this to a separate development box sometime in the 
future.
