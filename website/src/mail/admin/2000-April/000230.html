<PRE>Hi Clark
if a Formula 1 race car driver does a quick hack on his pick-up,
and the freeway has to get shut down because a quick hack
didn't work out as planned, he's going to get yelled at.

Just like duct tape is not intended for the freeway, PERL hacks
should not be used beyond prototyping, unless they have been
very thoroughly tested. Because PERL has to load the interpreter
for each routine or function, any run-away or uncontrolled loop
spreads the problem as fast as an oil pan full of hot oil on a
freeway curve.

No matter who causes that, somebody will be yelled at for that,
and driving a race car for a living is not an acceptable excuse.

The same applies on the servers. It makes no difference if
somebody is a recent AOL graduate or a professional programmer.
The only difference you might notice is that if the same outfit
needs to get yelled at repeatedly for the same reason, the
yelling tends to get louder with each occurrence.

Try to put it into perspective. This weekend we pumped over
3 Million multimedia postcards, many of them including Java
applets. All of them were active pages generated on the fly.
At Midnight, when the Send-Later parsers cut loose and sorted
through millions of files and picked out all the cards that had been
pre-sent in the last 2 months for delivery today, and then wrote
the pick-up notices for those cards into the mail queue,
there was no problem, even though card sending and picking
was proceeding normally. (In Europe it was already Sunday
morning  at that time and a LOT of last minute cards were sent)


Re Python: Much better than PERL. And you can watch it easily.
If it hangs in TOP, you should optimize and tune your script a bit.
But I have not heard of it ever stalling a server.
