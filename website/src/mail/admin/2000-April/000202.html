<PRE>I agree, stuff like that should be on a separate box.
When Wiki runs OK, a 486 is more than enough.
That's what it was written on. However, when it goes wild, even a big
Sun server can't handle it.

The same goes for your cvs.
Code like that should each be on a separate box, preferably with a
phone-in X-10 switch for hard rebooting it if nobody is around. The
way those programs hog resources when they go wild you probably
will need that occasionally.

Neither one of those two programs should be allowed to drag down the
public or other areas of JOS.

Ideally in a development environment you would have a &quot;public&quot;
machine that is the gateway to the different &quot;private&quot; development
machines. None of the development machines can drag down the
public machine, so that one is used not only for a gateway but also
for safe storage of encrypted back-ups. Timed incremental back-ups
from the development machines ensure that even a complete
hardware failure of any one of them does not loose more than a few
hours of work.

Each of the development machines should have the programs of the
other ones set up and ready, so that in a pinch the data from the
gateway machine can be restored onto it and so that it can carry
the functions of a dead development machine until that one is fixed.

With a set-up like that cheap &quot;disposable&quot; 486, 586 and Pentium
machines can be used for all but the main gateway and back-up
storage.
