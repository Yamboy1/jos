<PRE>Helmut is right about a &quot;gateway&quot; machine. We must try to understand what
he is saying. Helmut is rightfully complaining about CVS and CVSWeb, just
as he rightfully complained about JOS Wiki.

It doesn't sound to like Helmut is complaining about maintaining a
&quot;gateway&quot; machine for the JOS Project. A &quot;gateway&quot; machine on the Internet
is the main &quot;www&quot; machine. It is where you look for our home page. It is
&lt;URL:<A HREF="http://www.jos.org/">http://www.jos.org/</A>&gt; and, should continue to be.

Auxilliary machines, or &quot;developer&quot; machines, can be added, removed,
upgraded, downgraded, reorganized, change and redesigned -- without
affecting the &quot;gateway&quot; machine.

We need to learn this lesson. We should use machine names like they are
supposed to be used. A machine's physical location is irrelevant. A
machine's IP address is irrelevant. Who owns the box is irrelevant. How
many boxes we need is irrelevant. Transparency is the entire purpose of
machine name resolution services on the Internet.

1. &quot;jos.org&quot; is a domain, not just a machine name.

2. JOS HTTP should /always/ run on a machine called &quot;www.jos.org&quot;.

3. JOS FTP should /always/ run on a machine called &quot;ftp.jos.org&quot;.

4. JOS Wiki should /always/ run on a machine called &quot;wiki.jos.org&quot;.

5. JOS CVS and CVSWeb should /always/ run on a machine called &quot;cvs.jos.org&quot;.

6. Additional names can be added, as needed.

It is neither necessary nor desireable to run HTTP and FTP and Wiki and CVS
and CVSWeb on the same machine. We need a server farm, not one big server.

Broken links are hazzardous. We would give people the repeated impression
that the JOS Project is dead by constantly moving services around. We must
never do that. If we're going to fix this, we should fix it right -- so
that it never happens again.
