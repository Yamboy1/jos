<PRE>&gt;<i> Helmut, what exactly do you require for ownership
</I>&gt;<i> to be transfered; I tried last year (I went through
</I>&gt;<i> all the effort to setup an LLC and everything), but 
</I>&gt;<i> I did not meet your requirements.
</I>
	Let me know what if there's anything I can do to help.

&gt;<i> Perhaps re-directing to your server would be better...
</I>
	I agree.  We can ask SourceForge if they'd be willing to host
the wiki, as well.	

&gt;<i> &gt; Any references to the jos.org cvs server needs to be updated 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to point to the sourceforge cvs.  Kernel code goes into sourceforge 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Todd &quot;_quinn&quot; is taking care of this).  Other subprojects will have 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to open up new sourceforge accounts and check their sources into 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; those sourceforge project cvs repositories.  We'll have to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; coordinate to get the webpages to tie the sub-projects back 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; together...
</I>
	We should be able to add other sub-projects to the 'JOS'
repository.  If everything on the current/old jos.org box is in the CVS,
it can be tarballed and mailed to sourceforge for inclusion... but it may
be better just to take that tarball and see whose subprojects are still
active?  (e.g. by waiting around for them to ask what happened to
CVS)  (How does the SourceServer work?  Can we tarball its repository the
same way?)
