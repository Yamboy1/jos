It would be more efficient in C, but the problem is that cvsweb.cgi has
to be able to reconstruct any version of any file from the diffs CVS
stores. This is an intensive operation in any language - just less
intensive in C.

As for the CVS server itself, the latest version was rewritten entirely
in C for speed. Maybe that would have helped. But we all seem to agree
on moving our CVS repository over to sourceforge.net anyway. Sorry for
putting such a load on your server.
