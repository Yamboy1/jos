Subject: [JOS-Admin] cvs permissions fix

_quinn (or whoever owns the cvs process by the time you read this),

I have created a new startup script called pserver-new which should fix
some file permission problems. Unfortunately I can't restart the server
when the existing process is owned by someone else (maybe we could do
this with sudo - Helmut?)

The problem occurs if you create new files or directories. If your umask
isn't set properly, the correct permissions are only granted to the user
under which the cvs process is running. They are not granted to the
whole jos group which is a problem if someone else in the jos group
tries to restart the server (with the wrong umask).

The new script tries to set the umask for you.

Could you (or whoever owns the cvs process) please test if the new
script solves the problem? Thanks.

passwd can be left the way it is. The other two files should be
chmod'ed. I guess to:

-r--r--r--

ie. chmod 444 filename

	Well, we can't use the new start-up file because cvs chokes on
--allow-root when a remote user tries to do anything.

Hello all.

Who is "in charge" of CVS?  I'm starting to get
questions and requests concerning CVS that I need
to forward to the correct person.  I could really use
a list of all the JOS resources and who is the
point of contact for each... It should be in the 
Wiki (which I can setup).

Of primary importance, is anyone in charge of, or interested in being
in charge of SourceServer?  I don't
think parts of it works any more (i.e. adding new 
source).  Probably due to the change of environment 
that happened a few months ago which temporarily 
disabled RCS on the wiki (that has been fixed).  
Ideally, we could use the PrettyPrinting code to modify 
the webcvs.cgi interface and not have two separate 
(redundant?) source repositories.

Subject: [JOS-Admin] WikiWeb upgrades... testers wanted

Hello everyone,

I've upgraded the wiki to use the new version of Wiki
(twiki) developed by Peter Thoeny (based on Markus's 
JosWiki).

I'd like people to test the installation and see if
everything works.  Notice that this is running on
the same wiki documents as the normal wiki so making
changes in either one affects the other... be careful.

Basically all you need to do is to substitute "twiki"
for "wiki" in a url to use the new twiki engine.  So

http://jos.org/wiki/view/main/WebOverhaul
becomes
http://jos.org/twiki/view/main/WebOverhaul

This will let you see the same pages, rendered with
the new engine.

If you want to see the new features of the twiki
substitute Main for main in the url's so as above:

http://jos.org/twiki/view/main/WebOverhaul
becomes
http://jos.org/twiki/view/Main/WebOverhaul

We get RCS integration back into wiki, searching,
indexing, referenced-by and stricter wiki markups.  
Notice that the stricter markups will not render
"_italic_." or "_italic _" the way the way the old
wiki did (italicizing it).  Instead you have to do
"_italic_ ." to get the same behavior.  This allows
us to use regular _'s where we want by simply not
"sticking" them to words and leaving blanks around.

There is also some category/topic features of the
new Wiki which I have not exposed yet.  To learn
more about the wiki in particular use:

http://jos.org/twiki/view/Wiki

If you have questions or comments, send them to 
admin@jos.org or directly to me webmaster@jos.org.

	AFAIK, no one's "in charge" of the CVS, and John Morrison and I
asked for a "sourcemaster" volunterr to take care of running it for us a
while back, with no result.  However, myself, Ryan, John, and Robert
Fitzsimmons (I believe) all have accounts on the jos.org server, so any of
the four of us should be able to handle things.

You can remove that option. cvs 1.9 seems not to support that. I have
been testing cvs 1.10 and I think we might move over to it soonish.

CVS admin requests should be sent to this list. As Todd L. Miller
pointed out, many of us are able to fix most problems so posting to this
list will get the fastest response.

However, I would be what you would call the "cvs admin guy" - if you
need to know.

..

For those who don't know (!!) about a year ago I proposed and installed
(in cooperation with Borko) the JOS CVS server initially for kernel
development. He's disappeared off the JOS scene so I'm the only person
left with cvs administration experience. JM/_Quinn and Robert
Fitzsimmons pretty much handle their own modules these days while I
handle general cvs administration tasks including:

- cvs configuration and maintenance
- creation of top-level modules and any modules under jos/* (including
account creation for new developers under those modules)

Since jm and _quinn are using cvs a lot now we should work out how not
to step on eachother's toes. For example, we don't want two people
editing the same configuration file at the same time.

> Of primary importance, is anyone in charge of, or interested in being

I think Thomas Winzig wrote that. I'm not sure who took over. Does
anyone here know **anything** about SourceServer? (Clark?)

I would like to know one thing about it ...

Some people have proposed that everything in SourceServer be moved
across to CVS. To do this I need to know how to access plain source
files from SourceServer. I don't think it is feasible to move everything
across in one go - we would need to chase up each individual developer
and create accounts for them. I'd rather create the appropriate
directories in jos/library as developers are ready to move across.

This is something I have been working on. The latest version of
PrettyPrinter does hyperlinking but I still have a few bugs to iron out.
After that I can integrate it into cvsweb.

I did reply to that. I don't know whether you don't remember, or whether
this is a hint that you're not happy with my service, but here's what
happened.

At the time jm sent his email to the list complaining that CVS was not
working, I had just left for a two week vacation. I read his email from
an Internet Cafe and explained the situation. jos.org had just moved to
a new machine shortly before I had to leave - in fact the night before I
was up until 4:00am replicating the old cvs environment on the new
machine. I finally got it working and nodded off. When jm complained
that his remote client wasn't working, I explained (from a distant
Internet Cafe) that the cron job wasn't working properly and where to
find the pserver script. On the old machine, Borko and I would patrol
cvs day and night from opposite sides of the globe but Borko was never
given an account on the new machine and so he couldn't handle things
while I was away. He still does not have an account and he has now left
the jos project (as far as anyone can tell).

As for that cron job, that's still a mystery. Of course a script in
/etc/rc.d would be better. From memory Helmut had something against
that. Debugging cron jobs is pretty time consuming, especially over my
slow link but maybe I'll have another look at it.

Back to your comment: "no one's in charge", you seemed quite happy to
assume responsibility for the JJOS module so I was happy to have one
less thing to do. I haven't really touched the JJOS module since it was
created. If you want someone else to be in charge of managing JJOS,
that's fine. Administering cvs itself requires another level of
expertise. If you want someone else to take over from that too, that's
also fine. I'll stop when you find someone else.

(I haven't had time to proof read - if I've pissed anyone off, sorry!)

	Honestly, I had forgotten, probably since we haven't had any
problems with the CVS server!  My apologies.

	The problem is that I don't have *either* level of expertise.  I
really don't know the full capabilities of CVS, and in part that's
because we haven't needed it -- a remote RCS usage has sufficed for us
so far.  As I noted above, since I haven't noticed any problems with CVS,
you're doing a good job administering it.  And I believe the original
question about "who's in charge" was directed at the tree as a whole,
not the individual modules, although I lost that point writing the email.
At any rate, given the amount of work I'm doing to administer the module,
it could just as easily be said that anyone with an account on the jos.org
server is administering the JJOS module :)  Again, my apologies for 
my hastily-written and ill-considered previous reply.

	On the other hand, do you have any good references for CVS module
maintainers?  I imagine I'll like a break from coding up throws pretty
soon.

	Okay, removed the option and moved the current pserver to
pserver-old, and the modified pserver-new to pserver, and restarted it.
Hope this works.

Subject: [JOS-Admin] Alternative approach to "memory" classes...

Hi All;

Sorry for the wide distribution, but I am interested in hearing your
thoughts on the following, JOS-wide, and (unfortunately) related
issues...

Issue #1:

Just bought the "Inside JavaOS" book.  Haven't had time to read the
whole thing (you know how it is).  JavaOS has a quite different (and
much more comprehensive) approach to memory classes than any of the ones
I wrote about in my recent message to the kernel list (those of you who
aren't on the kernel list can check the archives if you're really
interested, but I really need your inputs on Issue #2...)

Seems they have opaque (to Java, anyways) address32 and address64
classes.  They also have "address range" classes, DMA address space
classes, and even (seems to me) I/O space classes (as a 16-bit address
space).  I haven't exactly figured out and/or read far enough to know
if/how they handle the *contents* of addresses as unsigned quantities,
although I'm sure they can handle it also via opaque classes.  Finally,
they even seem to have an approach to handling physical<->virtual
mapping machinery.

So, I guess this comes down to either of two options (please excuse the
hyperbole):

(1) inventing our own, unique, simplistic, must-be-upgraded-later
approach, which will be expedient in the short term, but will never be
able to use JavaOS drivers/software, and will be much harder for us to
get consensus upon (e.g., agreeing upon driver, system, OS, and "kernel"
APIs), or

(2) implementing something as close as is humanly possible to the JavaOS
API(s), which will be more work in the short term, but maybe less in the
long term, and which will obviate the consensus-building group-grope
problem we currently have, which makes it much harder to get anything
done that involves more than one person...

Basically, option (1) is the "let's re-invent the wheel" approach, and
(2) is the time-honored, Open Source "chase the tail-lights" approach. 
As much as I like designing my own APIs (of course, they would be far
superior to and more aesthetically pleasing than the JavaOS ones --
*N-O-T*), I'm kind of leaning towards option (2).  I mean, hell, we're
not redesigning the Java language, the bytecodes, or the java.* classes,
so...

Issue #2:

Are there any legal ramifications of cloning the JavaOS APIs?  Is
anybody in a position to find out?  If there are issues, I'd sure like
to know about them right now so that we can do option (1) instead...

	Paired with this issue: does anyone know what the
kind of redistribution of the JavaOS drivers is allowed?  I would guess
that individual manufacturers don't particularly care, but Sun might have
something against letting the drivers it ships with JavaOS spread to the
four routers of the internet.

	As for the legal ramifications of cloning the JavaOS APIs, we'll
be engaged in an even more time-honored approach than Open Source
"tail-light chasing" -- reverse engineering!

OK. Despite our excellent community process, its nice
in some situations to be able to point to someone when 
told "Take me to your leader!".  :)

OK.  Could you (Ryan) please contact kevinr@spin.com.mx
KevenRaul.  He's writing the CommandLineUtilities
and wants to put them into the CVS and use that
for development.  I've Cc'd him so he may contact
you...

Also, speaking of adding/maintaining CVS accounts,
how hard would it be to automate the process?  I think
we're "scaring" away developers because there are so
many things you need to do to get started.  First 
you need a WikiName and password, then you need to
add yourself to the MemberList, and join the right
mailing lists, and then get a separate CVS account.
I was thinking about trying to create a central
"account" management page/script that will allow
a person to manage all account information in a
single place.  Ideally choose/edit one WikiName,
account info, and password, set some check marks, and everything is
configured.  CVS commit access would have 
to be "approved" by module "owners" for pre-existing
CVS modules, but creating new modules (following
certain rules) should be easy/automatic.  Do you
think this is possible?

I hope someone does!  At present it appears broken.
It can read files but can't add any.

I'm one of the more vocal in this group.  It's 
confusing where to put source and why.  Once again, 
a finger pointing problem.  When asked, "Where do I 
put my source I want to contribute to JOS", I'd like 
to have one place to point...

All the source is in the /source dir of the jos.org
account.  The dir structure is arranged per package
name I believe.  There is a raw (as submitted java
source), java source (pretty printed), and html version 
of each file.  If we could move them over to CVS,
it may be best to do so (just to remove the confusion
of having two source repositories, with no correlation
between what's in which).  I propose simply putting
them in the CVS (the pretty printed version of the
source) with only the CVS admin having commit access
to them.  Then as the authors start contributing,
they can be granted commit access.  Since SourceServer
has been broken since, I believe March 1999, and I
have only had one person ask why its broken, I don't
think the source in the SourceServer is currently
under active development (or if it is, its being
developed outside of JOS).

Very cool.  Let me know when that's done so I can
announce it on the front page.  I also would like to 
modify the HowToSubmitSoftware and related pages if you 
think that we can move 100% of JOS source to CVS.
Basically, when SourceServer is fully "replaced".

This would be cool.  I don't have a ton of time
to toss at it, but I think it would be very useful.

As I understood, we were moving to CVS.  It would
be cool to have some of the SourceServer features
on top of CVS though... this could be a nice
"JavaCVS" project and would be welcome to the
Java development community.

It could also do things like automagically
run JavaDocs and such.

CVS

Altough a nice submission process would 
be cool.  Did we install webcvs.cgi?

It would be cool to have some way
to have submissions be approved by
someone who is a "committer".

A patch queue would be slick too,
many projects, like PostgreSQL
could use something like that.

Yes, whenever SUN is involved, watch out! Their lawyers sue their own
fathers for using their name, just to piss them off. Unlike M$ who goes out
of their way to foster community spirit and will do anything to get you to
use their stuff, with SUN you better count on their lawyers hassling you
and trying to chase you to the M$ camp.

Unless you have it in writing PRECISELY how much can be cloned in the
interest of standardization, you better stick to clean room procedure all
the way and re-invent the wheel.

No worries. I faulted in trying to read your thoughts (I'm not very good
at doing that).

There isn't really any documentation on this because each cvs project is
set up differently. With the way it's set up on jos.org you just need to
know how to create new accounts and grant them permissions (which you
already know how to do). If I change the way it works I will let you
know.

If you read any documentation, you should read a CVS user manual which
describes all the features you might use as a CVS developer. This is
something that all CVS developers should read. You can read
documentation comes with the cvs 1.10 distribution (I haven't checked
1.9). If you don't have it, you can get it from http://www.cyclic.com/ .
There are also several CVS reference manuals on the web in HTML format.

I think it is important to keep cvs accounts separate from wiki accounts
to keep security tight. New CVS accounts are created with the same wiki
name but a different password. I have asked people to encrypted their
desired passwords before sending them to me rather than just sending
plain text.

I also want to keep the number of CVS accounts to a minimum. It is
typical for there to be only a few people with CVS accounts (the inner
circle), while other contributers (the outer-circle) just send in
patches (eg. bug fixes) to the main developers. In our case, each
project leader definately has a CVS account. Other developers for that
project can be given an account if they are trusted.

There may be other ways - you're welcome to think of any. Perhaps we
could have two CVS servers - one for main developers, and another for
untrusted developers. It would *somehow* be automatically updated to
reflect changes in the main repository. I don't see this happening any
time soon though :-)

It might be useful to have some commandline tools to assist with the
administration process. If we have a web interface, any actions the user
wishes to do are postponed until a CVS admin approves the action (via
the commandline).

Thanks.

Do you mean put the pretty printed file in CVS? There is no point in
keeping version history of generated files. We just need to put the
source files in CVS and when pretty printed files are out of date and
need to be regenerated, they can just be written over.

It is possible (but difficult) to merge the javadoc and PrettyPrinter
output so that source code is pretty printed and the method headers are
displayed in html format. For now, automatically generating javadoc is a
good idea. It may even encourage Java developers to write comments :-)

I installed cvsweb.cgi. It's perl so it is easy to modify. Were you
thinking of submitting changes to source code through cvsweb.cgi?

If we did allow people to submit code through cvsweb.cgi we would need
something like a committer or reviewer.

I just had an idea.  Could we put the source for the wiki/twiki and the
Source Server, the pretty printer and any other such tools that we have in
our CVS repository?  Right now it is quite difficult to find the source for
the tools that make our site work.

I'm working on convincing Peter Thoeny (TWiki developer) to make JOS's
CVS our central repository for
the source.  I suppose we can always put our version
in there (but it would be better to have the main
repository on our CVS server).

As far as pretty printer, it would be a great idea IMHO.  I think it
would depend on what Ryan (or any other volunteers) are going to do
with integrating it into the cvsweb.cgi script.  If he/they are going
to do that, it would be better to just put cvsweb.cgi into the source
server and start integrating the java pretty printer.. probably as a
separate perl module.  Then the pretty printing functionality can be
used by others for whatever...

This sounds reasonable.  See below though.

The only problem with this approach is that we really need an active
commit administrator then.  I know that the original setup was intended
to host the kernel and main JOS OS code.  This system works well for
that.

The new problem is we have a ton of little utilities that people write
that should be put into CVS. The utility's author would like to be the
"commit admin" for that utility.  So we would end up with the need for
many small CVS projects managed by many accounts.  The only way around
this is to have a few priviledged commit managers that these utility
authors would have to go through to check files in and out of their
utility's source.  

I think that not giving an author direct control over their own source
(for a separate small project) may be prohibitive.  Both for the author
that does not like to have to go through an approver for their own
code, and for the commit admin that would have to be approving commits
to tons of projects.

So I am hoping that there's an easy way (i.e. automated) to allow
anyone to start a "project" which creates a separate CVS "area" for
which they become the commit admin for.  They have no special access to
any other part of the CVS, just their own.  They have the power to
grant commit priviledges for others (to invite other trusted developers
into the project) and to revoke them.  Is this possible?  

If not, I'm not sure that the general use of CVS for JOS source (other
than central code like the kernel) is necessarily a good idea.  If
things go well, we should be expecting hundreds of separate "OS
support" projects to pop up for everything from commandline utilities,
to little jos desktop clocks and other desktop applets, to
test/analysis tools.  I'm not sure that we can centrally create a
single JOS CVS for all this without fully automating the process.

We my have to have a "you're on your own, just provide links to your
source/binaries" policy like linux has.  And rely on authors to find
their own resources for version control and hosting... or hope that
bundlers like RedHat come along to organize things...

I would much prefer it, if we could, to centralize
these facilities and provide the infrastructure for all the JOS related
sources.

I don't think this will work so well.  Perhaps a separate CVS for the
kernel and one for the rest if security is a major issue...

No.  Just the raw source.

Agreed.  Both the pretty printed source, and generated javadoc would be
replaced when the raw CVS source is updated.

This is a great idea.  You need the same thing for the Wiki too...

Every open source project needs something like this.
