Well, I don't own a TV which means I have a TON of free time... I wish I 
did.  Somehow even without a TV I manage to have way too much to do!  :)

I do think a chat would be a good idea.

Oh, and nice to hear from you again Robert.  Long time no email!

&gt;<i>I'm keen, should we discuss what we want to discuss on the list so long?
</I>
It would be nice to put together an agenda if we have any important topics 
to discuss.  Of course, if we go that far, we might as well make it an 
&quot;official JOS meeting&quot;.  Shall we set a day/time so I can announce it on 
the jos website?  I was also thinking it wouldn't be a bad idea to restart 
the monthly JOS meetings if we can get a big enough group to attend.

I personally do have an agenda I'd like to promote:

1. State of the Union - It would be nice to create a JOS quarterly report 
or at least discuss the current state of JOS.  I have a vague idea of 
what's going on but it would be nice to get other people's impressions/input.

2.  JOS.org - creation of an official legal non-profit entity to enable 
fund raising and to formulate agreements/partnerships etc on behalf of the 
JOS project.  This was discussed as a &quot;Good Thing To Do (tm)&quot; a few weeks 
ago on the admin list.  Funds can be used to defray costs which are 
currently coming out of JOS member pockets, and perhaps sponsor 
trips/meetings/conferences, etc.  I guess ultimately, we may even be able 
to do something like FreeBSD and hire a minimal full time staff of 
programmers to work on JOS full time.  The timing is good because of point 3.

3.  Sponsorship - pushing forward, Etoolz (the company I work for) has 
contacted our parent company Eagle Wireless and both companies are very 
interested in forming a relationship and sponsorship with the JOS 
project.  This would dovetail nicely with a JOS.org if it existed.  I would 
like to discuss how this might work, people's opinions on such a 
relationship, etc.

4.  Website - I'm about 75% done with a rewrite of the jos 
website.  Hopefully, I'll get a prototype setup so you can give me some 
feedback.  If not, at least get some ideas on what people see as being 
needed additions/changes from the current site design.
