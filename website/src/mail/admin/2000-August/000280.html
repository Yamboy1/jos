Agreed.

&gt;<i>Reorganizing our website

Agreed.  It is the beginning of a process to make jos more accessible and 
more friendly to new users and developers.

&gt;<i>Are we doing anything that works? I think so. I would

</I>
I would too.  But what are we doing that works?  Right now, I think JOS is 
very broken.

&gt;<i>1. Eliminate the redundent mailing lists.
</I>
I agree.  I want to switch them all over to sourceforge and cut it down to 
maybe 4 total:

announce - extremely low traffic
general - advocacy and general discussions of a non-technical nature
admin - the bureaucracy of running jos.  shouldn't concern developers or users
developers - technical discussions.

&gt;<i>Why have more than one mailing list when one mailing list will do?
</I>
When jos was first formed, the mailing lists were needed because there was 
too much discussion.  Now that the JOS project is essentially in 
hibernation mode, we certainly can re-consolidate the mailing lists.  This 
is something that should be discussed on the admin list.

&gt;<i>Have you seen all of the JOS-related mailing lists on e-Groups?
</I>
Yes.  It's the archive of the original or second home for the jos mailing 
lists.  Essentially the lists have lived in 3 separate places to date, and 
the former two are archived in two spots, egroups and on spin.

&gt;<i>2. Carefully edit the static HTML pages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>There should be more discussion on the admin/biz mailing list about what
</I>&gt;<i>pages should be created and what they should say.
</I>
Agreed.  Please discuss it there.

&gt;<i>I reviewed your JOS
</I>&gt;<i>Project pages on SourceForge. Actually, I like it less than the pages on
</I>&gt;<i>jos.org.
</I>
Why specifically?  It's very much in a formative stage right now so if you 
give specifics, it will probably be changed.

&gt;<i>The review of static HTML pages should be an on-going process. Let's start
</I>&gt;<i>the process now. I like the idea of a separate HTML page for &quot;old&quot; news. It
</I>&gt;<i>is a lot of responsibility to create static HTML pages for the project that
</I>&gt;<i>are off Wiki.
</I>
The wiki is a very poor resource for providing structured content to new 
people and people that are just &quot;looking around&quot; (i.e. the press).  It 
takes time and patience to find anything in particular in the wiki, and to 
use it to learn.  As an example, if i were a member of the press and wanted 
to find out how to contact &quot;some one in charge&quot; by telephone can I find 
that in our current website?  The answer, &quot;good luck&quot;.  You may hunt around 
for as long as you like and think you kind of know possibly who your best 
bet is, and then most likely either give up or send email to 
<A HREF="mailto:webmaster@jos.org">webmaster@jos.org</A> as its the only contact email for the group really 
anywhere...  This is Very Bad (tm).

I agree that there is a lot of responsibility in creating static pages for 
the group, but I think it must be done.  The current website is pretty 
unfriendly to anyone not already fully devoted to jos and willing to really 
&quot;work with it&quot;.
