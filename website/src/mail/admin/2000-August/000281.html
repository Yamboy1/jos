<PRE>At 09:22 AM 8/16/00 -0400, you wrote:
&gt;<i>Have you read all of the articles on JOS Wiki?
</I>
No.  I haven't had the time.

&gt;<i>I set a goal to read all
</I>&gt;<i>articles. I thought I was done. Only recently, I discovered a long list of
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;lost&quot; articles. &quot;Lost&quot; articles are not referenced by any other article.
</I>&gt;<i>Imagine how I felt. I thought I finished reading all articles. I thought I
</I>&gt;<i>had an good idea what other members had written and the work other members
</I>&gt;<i>had done. To discover all these lost articles, it is disconcering. I wonder
</I>&gt;<i>how many other articles are still &quot;lost&quot;.
</I>
Probably quite a few.  When Todd Miller's sfWiki project is completed the 
wiki system itself should be able to identify and alert use to orphaned pages.

&gt;<i>I also set a goal to read all messages posted in JOS-related mailing lists.
</I>&gt;<i>I read everything on jos.org. I thought I was done. Then, I remembered the
</I>&gt;<i>mailing list archives on eGroups. I started reading those messages. They
</I>&gt;<i>are filled with very important information about what others want, what
</I>&gt;<i>others think and what others have already tried.
</I>
Oh, well if that's the case, you'll also want to read the articles posted 
to spin.de.  You should be able to find a link on the MailingLists wiki 
page or following the spin link on our home page.  After we settle the 
mailing list issues, we should consolidate all jos mail archives to one 
location on _our_ website, then shut down these other achives to eliminate 
confusion.

&gt;<i>I am very irritated about the &quot;back-door&quot; editing of JOS Wiki articles,
</I>&gt;<i>such as the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.metamech.com/wiki/view/Main/TheGlossary">http://www.metamech.com/wiki/view/Main/TheGlossary</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I suspect that a few members of the JOS Project can replace Wiki articles
</I>&gt;<i>through a back door, without using an HTML browser. The Glossary article
</I>&gt;<i>obviously has been edited; but, it still shows revision 1.1 and still shows
</I>&gt;<i>my name as the last one who edited it. It is impossible to see from the
</I>&gt;<i>website what the article used to look like.
</I>
No.  It should be impossible to edit pages outside of the web form.  I'm 
the only one with access to the raw data without using the web forms.  I 
use this access only to do RCS operations on pages that have been 
completely destroyed.  I have not touched TheGlossary so if it has been 
damaged recently, its due to a bug either in my RCS setup or the wiki 
itself (I'd guess the later).

&gt;<i>I suspect that this explains the missing MemberList article. Somehow the
</I>&gt;<i>entire revision history of the MemberList article was erased. The article
</I>&gt;<i>was damaged. It require extraordinary measures to bring the article back.
</I>
Yes.  I think the wiki code is misbehaving.  There is no plans to find and 
patch bugs in the current wiki as we hope to move to the new sfwiki soon.

&gt;<i>It is rude. It is unacceptable to destroy the revision history of a Wiki
</I>&gt;<i>article, replace Wiki articles without using an HTML browser, change an
</I>&gt;<i>article while keeping someone else's name. It is the policy of the project
</I>&gt;<i>that an author retains copyright of contributed articles. Erasing the
</I>&gt;<i>revision history makes it difficult for a contributor to prove his or her
</I>&gt;<i>copyright.
</I>
Actually this is misleading.  I've been wanting to change the copyright 
notice at the bottom of the page to reflect the reality but have been 
hesitating because we'll be moving soon (and the page templates will change 
then).  The wiki is a collaborative document system.  Anything in the wiki 
is the property and copyright of the wiki.  If you want to retain copyright 
or editorial/layout control of a pages content, it should not be put in the 
wiki.  Because at any time, anyone can come along and change 
it!  Essentially words on the wiki are &quot;public domain&quot;.  Otherwise, there's 
no point in allowing other people to edit pages that someone else 
created.  We should just allow annotations to a page if that were the case.

As for the revision history of wiki articles.  That is a convenience to 
make accidents less costly.  It was never designed or intended to create 
snapshots or historical records of the wiki.  The wiki is constantly 
changing.  Think of it as &quot;oral history&quot; in written form.  Just as a story 
changes as its passed from storyteller to storyteller, so to does the wiki 
change from moment to moment as pages are added, deleted, and edited.  The 
extreme example of this is the c2 wiki (the original wiki which we try and 
emulate in spirit).  It has no revision history at all.  I think it makes a 
hidden copy of each page that the administrator can use to restore a page 
if its been gutted.  c2 wiki is also completely open and doesn't require a 
login or password to edit.  The sfWiki will return to this original c2 wiki 
as the jos wiki seems to be too far from the original intent of the 
original wiki.  There is too much a sense of individual ownership, 
permanence, and &quot;members only&quot; feel in the current wiki.  It's being used 
for more than it should be and that over extension is showing (in the 
problem with poor organization for example).

This is also the reason I think the important and fundamental documents 
need to be moved to a static site as we have a lot of technical information 
in the wiki that we can't afford to lose!

For historical reasons, a &quot;snap shot&quot; of the wiki seems a good idea and 
your distributions are filling this need.  Todd hopes to get snap shotting 
of the wiki as a set of html pages as a feature of the sfwiki...  Probably 
in a 1.1 version.
