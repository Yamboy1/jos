The SourceServer contents have been put into a compressed tar 
ball (2.7 MB) located at:

http://www.jos.org/source/jos1c_srcserv.tar.Z

This has also been announced on the main jos webpage.  
Hopefully someone will integrate it into the normal distribution as 
there is a lot of extra content in that tar ball (3 copies of every 
source file, and the SourceServer code itself for example).  If 
someone does, let me know.  I think I'll want to remove the tar ball 
as well as take the SourceServer offline.

This is what I had in mind too.  :)  It's on the to-do list after getting 
the current next gen website online.  The current next gen website 
is about 80% of the way to beta state.  It's basically going to 
exhibit the same functionality as the current wiki. But the big 
unseen infrastructure addition is a fully integrated user/session 
management foundation.  With this in place, permission issues 
(esp. upload and edit permissions) will be much easier to address 
for things like source repositories.

My experience as webmaster answering questions for JOS is that 
most open source programmers are not comfortable with using 
CVS.  Especially those that are writing small utilities.  (Or those 
that want to download source for anything).  

This is the reason that the SourceServer even with all its 
shortcomings, was so popular.  No CVS tools, no new techniques 
to learn.  Just upload your jar and SourceServer displays source for 
that jar and that's it.  No merging, no client software, no 
updating/commiting etc.  What's in SourceServer is the latest and 
"canonical" version of that source.

The big question is, what should be JOS' "canonical" source 
repository?

IMHO, it should be a tool like SourceServer (let's call it SSTNG for 
SourceServer: The Next Generation) not CVS.  All JOS source 
should be checked into SSTNG, even if that means there's also a 
version in CVS.  The source in SSTNG basically serves as "official" 
snapshots of the JOS source.  This simplifies things for most 
people.

CVS becomes a working repository only used by those projects 
that require collaboration between several developers (such as the 
kernel group) that isn't feasible to handle by more traditional (if less 
technical) methods such as emailing diffs to a "lead" programmer.  
CVS will still allow adventurous and bleeding-edge people to 
anonymously get CVS source that is basically "daily build" source. 

Groups that use CVS appoints a "lead" programmer that 
periodically checks out CVS sources and inserts it into SSTNG.

SSTNG only stores 1 copy of source.  If new source is checked in 
by users with permission, it replaces the version in SSTNG.  This 
follows the behavior of the old SourceServer and keeps things 
simple for everyone.

For record keeping purposes, every so often, someone from the 
distribution group takes a snapshot of the entire SSTNG contents.  
The last x number of snapshots and other "signficant" snapshots 
can then be made available for download.

Within SSTNG itself, we have functionality as per Gilbert's 
suggestions:

You upload source as "distributions".  For clarity, I'm going to call 
them source jars.  Basically, a jar of all the source needed to build 
a single product (the product being a java application, a library, 
etc).  A source jar can be linked to other source jars to indicate 
dependence on other JOS products (such as shared class library 
jars).

SSTNG handles uploads and downloads at the source jar level.  It 
is up to the "lead" developer(s) how many source files belong to a 
single product (and thus a single source jar).

SSTNG will display source on a source file level via pretty printed 
HTML.  

Each pretty printed source file is linked to the raw source file, and 
its associated source jar.  Anyone is free to view/download source 
file by file via their web browser, or via the entire source jar using 
the link to its associated sourcejar.

For a project you have a "lead" developer or developers that has 
upload permissions to SSTNG for a project.  Each project can have 
as many source jars as they want (within reason).  If you replace 
one of your source jars with a new one, SSTNG delete's all source 
associated with the old jar and replaces it with the new one.  

So to browse source, you first choose a project, then a source jar, 
then navigate via package names.  This does allow for overlapping 
package names/spaces/classes so developers should be careful of 
package name usage.  A JOS Package name reservation system 
is also planned at some really future date for the website...

Each uploaded source jar will be exploded into individual source 
files, pretty printed HTML versions can be auto-generated, as well 
as javadoc'd.

Anything I missed or got wrong?  Let me know.  I'm obviously not 
working on this right now but it is a future project or my list.  If 
anyone wants to help out, let me know.

Uh oh. I can't find our most recent messages on the architecture mailing

Inside a JOS Wiki article, I would like to put a *link* to a recent e-mail
message in the architecture archives. I don't think its a good idea to
copy-and-paste e-mail to JOS Wiki. That is a practice that should be
generally discouraged.

I was surprised to find none of the recent e-mails displayed in the
archives, especially the thread called "[JOS-Arch] What is JOS?"

The emails are archived but the index page that links to them seems to
be broken. The end-of-file is encountered prematurely. There is one
"What is JOS?" message accessible from the index so you should be able
to reach the follow-ups by clicking "next message".

Clark, can you please have a look at mailman and see what the problem
is? - Thanks.

This is my experience, too. As members of an open source project, we should
develop a hassle-free policy for downloading distributions.

Downloading is a far more frequent activity than uploading (or patching).
Because of its frequency, it should be optimized for our target market to
get in and get out with a minimum of hassle.

-----

Now about Source Server...

I downloaded jos1c_srcserv.tar.Z. I uncompress'd it, something like this:

$ uncompress jos1c_srcserv.tar.Z

Uncompress created jos1c_srcserv.tar.

I untar'd it, something like this:

$ tar xvf jos1c_srcserv.tar *.raw

I am working on the assumption that these .raw files are the original,
unprocessed source code that members of the JOS Project uploaded to the
Source Server.

I wrote a raw package copier in Java to copy all *.raw files to *.java files.

$ rawpackagecopy path=/linux/srcserv package= show=all

I found that jos1c-srcserv is very different from jos1d-srcserv. There are
different packages, different classes, different compiler errors. It's
almost as if Source Server didn't overwrite .java files when a member tried
to overwrite earlier code.

Soon, I'll have jos1c-srcserv-2.tar.Z as a source-code only redistribution
of jos1c-srcserv.tar.Z.

-----

About new source code pages...

If I tar'd and compress'd HTML pages from my off-line syntax highlighter,
could you add them to the JOS website?

I was thinking of a URL, something like this:

1. http://www.jos.org/browse/index.html contains a list of "products". A
product is a collection of Java packages. A casual observer from anywhere
on the Internet should be able to start on this page and read all of the
JOS open source code.

2. http://www.jos.org/browse/descriptions.html contains a one paragraph
description for each package from Source Server.

3. http://www.jos.org/browse/jos1c-srcserv/index.html contains a list of
Java packages and classes from the Source Server.

4. http://www.jos.org/browse/jos1c-srcserv/default.BitSet.html contains the
syntax-highlighted code from default/BitSet.java.

Is there a problem with space? How much free space is on www.jos.org?

Are you sure? Are you saying you want to *replace* the current source
server, eliminating the the original source server from www.jos.org?

If so, we should make some kind of announcement (shouldn't we?). Or, is
this the list where such announcements are made?

When I put all these HTML files in a jos1c-srcserv-2-html.tar.Z archive,
they will be in a /source/ directory as you requested.

Do you have any comments about my idea for multiple products? multiple
versions?

If there is a product index at /source/index.html, additional products can
branch out from there.

As cautious as every, I think it might be a good idea to create a prototype
of this new part of the JOS website before committing to it on www.jos.org.

Yes.  It is still causing problems because it's there (and the docs 
still say you can upload source using it).  So people try and 
download source from it (which is in some places corrupted as you 
have discovered).  And they try and upload source into it (which 
shouldn't work but who knows).

So the best solution seems to me to remove it from the site as 
soon as we have an alternative way of making the source that was 
in it available to people.

We definitely need something to replace it, but in its current state, 
it causes more trouble than its worth.

> If so, we should make some kind of announcement (shouldn't we?). Or, is

Yes, we will announce it.  I'll announce the change on the admin 
and general lists as well as on the main web page (www.jos.org).

> Do you have any comments about my idea for multiple products? multiple
> versions?

I think its a great idea.  We definitely should try and create enough 
product distributions so that you don't have to download stuff you 
don't want.  As far as multiple versions, I would like to make 
historical "snapshots" available as jar's (as well as the latest 
version of each product), and only put the html pretty printed 
source up for the latest version of the source for each product (so 
as to avoid confusion).

Yes.  Actually, I was planning on putting it on the www.jos.org site, 
but just not announcing it for a while so that the core members can 
hit it and comment before making a groupwise announcement.  
Sorta an in-house beta.  Are you planning on including the kernel 
sources as one of the products?
