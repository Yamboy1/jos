No problem. We used to have them on but nobody used them so last spring we
stopped installing them on new machines. Just locate the stuff and we'll
see where it should go. PHP3 I think has to go up in the root with the C
compilers, the rest can probably live happily inside JOS.

Great.  PostgreSQL has it's own user.  If you create a user
for me, (we can install the program in /sites/jos/postgres )
this would be cool.  I'll also need an entry for the postmaster 
in your /etc/inittab (I'll send you the entry)


As for PHP3, there are two ways to run it, one as a cgi script
(which isn't all that safe) and the other one as a Apache builtin
module (which I've heard is much faster and safer).  I assume you
are using the secure version of Apache, how hard would it be to
buildin PHP3 support?

Thanks!

Hi all,

Since the 'biz' list apparently got nixed, I'm wondering what the best
mailing list is to have discussions about the upcoming Constitution vote and
other non-site related administrative discussions that are not of general
interest to the entire community?  While we were developing the Constitution
we used the unused 'requirements' list for this purpose.  I don't see a good
place in the @jos.org lists for this type of discussion.  Right now we are
having these discussions on private email but would like for them to be
archived.  Do you have any suggestions?  Why was the 'biz@jos.org' list
nixed?  I will admin it if the reason it was nixed was for lack of admin.

I talked to Helmut some, and he dosn't seem

I couldn't get PostgreSQL to compile on his

So, unless anyone else has any ideas, we can 
stick with the previous plan, we keep all of 
the static pages and the wiki web on www.jos.com 
and put the PHP3/PostgreSQL stuff on db.jos.org?

Is this ok?

Just go to for example 

http://hicards.com
and have a look how a simple, very basic database is 
used to serve pages either with a keyword search or 
by clicking on one of the 50 categories.

Both keyword search and category selection produce
scrollable result tables for final selection. By clicking 
on a selection you use SSI to pass variables that are 
then used to construct a page according to stored data.

Go ahead and try it !
On the constructed page,  called a "Composition Page",
where you compose a postcard, you select some stuff 
and add text, addresses etc.
Choose the option to send the card later and see 
how that is done.

Then choose to send the card to 25 people, and see 
how you jump out to a detour page to collect another 
50 variables before going on to submit and generate 
and send the actual output.

Also note how all the pages are built with virtual 
includes for tops, headers, footers, etc., and how the
dynamic banners are linked into 2 or more accounting
databases.

Sure, it is probably a lot more involved than what you
need, but it is a very clean and simple example 
of using databases and SSI.

Btw., on that site you will also see Java in action.
Choose your horoscope, and it will scroll the current 
day's horoscope. If you send a card and it will be 
picked up for example next Tuesday, then it will
correctly display THAT day's correct horoscope, 
even though that horoscope is not even written 
yet when you send the card. 

How ? At run-time the Java text scroller simply 
looks in the horoscope bin what is there at that time,
formats the raw text for your browser and screen 
width and scrolls it.

So, send a few cards to your friends, and watch 
the process. You will probably get all kinds of 
useful ideas from it.

From my brief experimentation with servlets, I would argue that they 
belong in the realm of "Web Application Software".  And for the same 
reason that you don't find that many dynamic sites being driven by C or 
lisp code, I don't feel that java is a great choice simply because there's 
too much "mental overhead" in creating simple web sites driven by java.  
You actually have to design a program, code, compile, etc.  I know, boo 
hoo hoo.  But if you're familiar with the frequency of changes, updates, 
and complete rewrites on websites you'd know that any time saved is 
huge.

(IMHO) With servlets it's a lot of design and work to simply get the 5 
latest update announcements posted to the update database, formatting 
it into a table and spitting it out in html.  You have to worry about getting 
the jdbc driver loaded and connected, then how you're going to get the 
html template for the page, parse it, insert the database content 
(formatted) into the page and stream the whole mess to the web server.  
Maybe worth the effort if you're doing a join across several disparate 
databases and trying to use xml metadata to connect everything...

With scripting tools like php, you are author the page, insert simple 
tags to indicate to php that you're going into php mode, insert the php 
code, and then close the tag.  So the html and code are in the same 
source.

I think servlet have their place and that we should try and get them 
running on the site for other uses (maybe a wiki replacement, or for 
source control) but for the basic web site, its just not a very practical 
technology.

Comments?

Iain,

I am an active servlet developer and I can certainly see your points for
general page development.  For that there are .jsp pages as an easier
alternative.

The main reason I want servlets on the site is that I want to replace the
PERL stuff, such as the source server and wiki, as you mentioned.  We should
somehow be able to integrate the source server and the CVS repository.
Downloading off of the source server is buggy and a pain (though I have
written a quick Java utility to take the pain out of it) and it would be
nice to make some changes to it.  The problem is that my Perl is extremely
rusty and the original authors of those tools either aren't working on JOS
anymore or are no longer making improvements.  There have been a couple of
starts at making a servlet wiki, but those have generally stopped due to
there not being a place to run them on the JOS site because it doesn't
support servlets.  Not having the ability on the site greatly decreases the
number of JOS participants who have the skills to help with site
development;  whereas if we have servlet support, most if not all JOS
participants have the skills necessary.

That and Todd's point. :)

Avery J. Regier

For that purpose, I couldn't agree more.  Especially with the wiki and 
CVS server there are so many obvious enhancements that a java servlet 
and java client would add.  

So, how about it Helmut?  

Or can we set up another machine for the servlet server?  Although that 
would leave www.jos.org with practically nothing left if wiki and source 
server went there.  Hasn't this been discussed before?  I thought I recall

If you guys can convince me that servlets are still being used in the real
world outside of some schools, and that there is some real world benefit to
them, we will quite gladly enable them.

However, so far nobody has been able to show me any reason why we should
take them off the shelf where PHP3, PERL and MIVA sit.

If servlets can accomplish better and faster and easier what all our other
clients routinely do with XXSSI, I will be  _VERY_  interested. 

Anything that is better or faster or easier than what we currently use,
will be eagerly and quickly installed. 

I have explained to you yesterday in great detail how we use SSI  and Java
for using variables to produce dynamic content, and I showed you a simple
and straightforward and easy to understand example:


http://hicards.com

Show me on THAT example, how that lady could do it better or faster or
easier with servlets, and you got me convinced. But simply saying that it's
not quite as bad as PERL, that's not good enough.

I WANT progress, so please convince me !

Well, show me !
WE use Java, but so far all JOS is noticed for is for putting extremely
disproportionate loads on the server with archaic relics like PERL and
Python. Just look at TOP next time you go in with telnet. You don't see the
sites that use Java, SSI, XXSSI and SHTML to process a thousand dynamic
multimedia pages per hour lingering on TOP. Their processes just zip right
through. The only ones that are lingering are  your "view", your "python",
etc. 

I had hoped we would be learning from you,  that you would contribute
something new and better, or at the very least come up with a decent applet
now and then. 

If you can "write any code that is required", SHOW me on that example I

If the people writing the web site would like to use
servlets for the dynamic pages, they can do so at db.jos.org,
I can build mod_jserv in if required.

The only problem with servlets (besides memory and speed, which
are also problems with PHP3 and Perl, etc), is that JDBC dosn't
understand domain sockets, and thus, TCP/IP sockets must be
enabled on the database.  This makes things slightly less secure,
since there is one more port open for crackers.

On the plus side for java, is the gjc compiler that
cygnus is working on.  I hear the speedups are 2-10x
the interpreted code.  However, it'll be a _long_ time
before we see that available for servlets...

PHP3 has proven to be relatively efficient, when you use
it only for SSI, it's speed/time characteristics are 
almost identical to Apache's built in SSI (since PHP3 is
a compiled module).  When you start to use it for other
tasks, (which SSI/XSSI cannot do), then it is, of course,
slower.  But then, the alternative is a CGI call...

As for perl, perl_mod is loaded once, removing 
the hudge performance penalty that exists.  If 
Helmut was smart, he'd include mod_perl in his
apache compile and he'd see the wiki processes
go to the bottom of his list...

You have a chance to learn from us.  You're not taking it.  There have been 
repeated requests for servlets by various people within the JOS project 
over the course of time.

Here are some of the reasons why you haven't been learning from us:
* PERL and Python are not the core competencies of the majority of JOS 
members.  By nature, Java is.  It is of no surprise to me that some of the 
tools we have built to support what we are trying to accomplish are poor 
performers.  There have only been a few people who knew those languages and 
technologies well enough to write those tools, and some of those people did 
not stay with the project or got too busy to support the tools and make 
improvements anymore.  We don't necessarily have people to take up the 
slack because the core competency of our members is Java.
* We haven't had much need for writing client side Java.  For those things 
which we do need (such as the Chat applet) they required server-side 
processes.  I don't know what the server portion of the Chat applet was 
written in, but it certainly didn't stay running for long.  There isn't 
much that people will be willing to do for the client-side Java piece if it 
can't be used anyways.  Instead we have reverted to tried and true IRC.

I work for an international, fortune 500 (at least) company and was the 
technical person who spearheaded bringing servlets into our computing 
environment and tested, recommended, implemented, and supported the servlet 
runner.  It took a little bleeding to get the bugs worked out, but that 
didn't take long.  Now the servlet applications we have are the most stable 
and well behaving on the whole.  They are fast because a new process does 
not have to be created for every hit like CGI.  Not only that but because 
of their architecture, the only cost to starting execution of a normal 
servlet hit is to create a new thread (depending on the servlet runner, 
some of them even pool the threads).  We have been amazed at how many 
applications we could fit onto one NT box.  (We had thought the limit of 
manageability would be about ten per box, but we have already tripled that 
with more to come.  The overhead on that box is not from the servlets, but 
from our choice to have each application (each of which can be a rather 
large number of servlets) in a seperate web server instance.  The web 
servers are taking up far more memory than the well-writtten servlets.)  If 
that can be done on a Windows machine, imagine what we can do on a Unix 
box!

Granted, we do have a very stable JIT compiler for our platform.  I don't 
know what the status is of JIT compilers for the platform JOS is on (I'm 
not even sure what that is.)  If there is no JIT compiler for the platform, 
then we may be better off just waiting to go the servlet route until there 
is a good one.  You can expect a 10X performance gain over plain 
interpreted.

Your apparent perception that servlets are not being used cannot be farther 
from the truth.   They are being used all over the place and far more than 
applets anymore.  It is kind of hard to see because they are all server 
side, and there are many ways of masking their tell-tale sign in the URL.

Servlets can and do have some drawbacks.  They are not good for everything, 
and a good deal of what it sounds like you do they are not likely better 
for.  There are, for instance, some problems with having to embed HTML in 
your servlet code.  There are ways around this obstacle such as creating 
reusable frameworks and tools for this purpose, such as many devlelopers 
have done at my company.  There are also technologies such as page 
compilation and JSP to help with that too.  However, the flexibility and 
performance you gain over other technologies makes that pain worthwhile for 
many a project.  Also, if you have a stupid developer, you can have memory 
problems with servlets, but that is just like any other technology.

If the JOS members are given the ability to develop the JOS site with the 
technology that is their core competency, you will quite likely start 
seeing some very interesting things come out of the project which will be 
of a help to you.  I wouldn't expect much too fast, because site 
development is not our primary focus.  Writing an operating system is.  We 
will write the tools that are necessary for us to better communicate to 
help us reach that goal.  If you decide that it isn't worh it, then we will 
make do with what we have.

We are appreciative of what you have contributed to us and the support you 
give us.  I'm going to try and get back to studying Todd's code now...

Thanks,

Well, show me !
WE use Java, but so far all JOS is noticed for is for putting extremely
disproportionate loads on the server with archaic relics like PERL and
Python. Just look at TOP next time you go in with telnet. You don't see the
sites that use Java, SSI, XXSSI and SHTML to process a thousand dynamic
multimedia pages per hour lingering on TOP. Their processes just zip right
through. The only ones that are lingering are  your "view", your "python",
etc.

I had hoped we would be learning from you,  that you would contribute
something new and better, or at the very least come up with a decent applet
now and then.

If you can "write any code that is required", SHOW me on that example I
mentioned:

OK, before this gets too far into advocacy, I think we should just settle 
this for our particular situation.  Anyone that wants to continue the 
debate can take it offline.  For JOS:

www.jos.org
=========
Status: Will remain unchanged (Thank you's to Helmut and Webby)
Environment:  Perl, SSI, and HTML (remains same)

Static pages (with our without SSI), wiki, and the FTP/source server will 
live here.

db.jos.org
=========
Status: Our dynamic machine (Thank you's to Clark Evans)
Environment: Perl, SSI, HTML, PHP, PostgreSQL, Java Servlets

Dynamic pages, forms processing, cron jobs to auto-update 
www.jos.org, and xperimental wiki/ftp/source server projects that require 
Servlets can live here.

So if you're interested in trying to port wiki or the source server to java 
servlets/java clients, you can test installs and put up a beta site on 
db.jos.org.  If we decide to make a switch to a new servlet based 
system, Helmut can evaluate if the new java servlet based system shall 
be moved to www.jos.org.  It would be Helmut's decision because he 
must do the installation of servlet support, and its his machine that 
could potentially suffer from poor performance.

If he decides not to, we can either leave it on db.jos.org (if its ok with 
Clark) or find a new home for it.  Any disagreements with this?  Post it 
to the list so we can make a decision on this and move on.

-iain

btw - where would an email to webmaster@jos.org, support@jos.org, 
etc go right now?  I was thinking that those would be nice email 
addresses to put in certain places on the new web site... :)

	Sounds like a plan to me.  Avery seems to think (I would, albeit
w/ no experience or numbers to back me up) that servlets will work well
and work efficiently, and in general be a very superior solution.  If this
is the case, than helmut should be relatively easy to convince and
db.jos.org won't be needed for very long.  (Though it might be handy to
test servlet updates.)

Currently those addresses bounce to me, NOT because I want them, but
because nobody else seems to want them for more than a few weeks.There
doesn't seem to be any noticeable amount of mail to those addresses. If any
of you want them, just tell Clark or me. It only takes a moment to assign
them. All I ask is that if you get busy with other things or change your
ISP, tell me.

I don't think anybody else on that machine uses PERL any more.
There are a bunch of HTML based chats on that machine, 
but you never see them linger, neither at the top nor at the bottom.

Also, hanging Perl onto Apache won't make a bit of difference with Wiki. 

The program itself isn't really DOING anything that should account for a
detectable load. It's not doing serious graphics work or compiling big
stats,  -just minor messing with text and simple searches. Compared to all
the heavy stuff flying through, that SHOULD not show up at all, and above
all, light stuff like that should not linger in TOP.

Maybe when you port Wiki to Java or C,  you could try to find out what in
it hogs resources and doesn't release them.

Iain,

I downloaded the new version of Apache, mod_jserv, and mod_php3 
and installed them on db.jos.org.  The installation isn't perfect,
so you are welcome to fix it up.   Apache is installed at /opt/apache,
JServ is installed at /opt/jserv, and Java 1.1.7 is installed at
/opt/java.  The "dev" group owns these trees and the /usr/local/src tree
which contains the distribution.  Currently, the copy of apache in
/opt/apache is running on port 8080 and I think I got the configuration
correct.  PostgreSQL 6.4 is also up and running on that box, with
the TCP/IP sockets enabled.

So... I guess, let me know if you have problems.  I no doubt made
some mistakes in the setup, but you have permission to fix anything
in the dev group.

Best,

Clark

	The files in question are owned by 'ryanh,' who I would guess is
Ryan Heise; I can't change the permissions, which don't include
group-write, unlike the rest of the jos directories.  If we can't get a
hold of ryan or a sysadmin to make the change, I could probably copy them
to some other directory with the right permissions.  (I'm not sure if this

Hello all,

The proposed "new" www.jos.org front end (index.html web page) is now 
available for review at www.jos.org/test/.  As you can see its not that 
much different than the current one.  I've been working on database 
integration issues.  However, that's taking too long so I wanted to get 
something moving (so everyone thinks _something_ related to the www 
re-org is happening).

You may be wondering what is/are the benefit(s) of this web re-org.  
Right now this seems to be just a new border around the original web 
?front door? page with links to Wiki.  Well, the idea is to provide some 
structure to Wiki for new comers, members of the press, and those of 
us who don?t like to bookmark every section of the Wiki so we can find 
things.  The other is that we hope to add database functionality to make 
things like news and status reports easier to do than with Wiki.  What 
do you think?  Discussion should be carried out on the general jos 
mailing list (general@jos.org).  If there are no serious objections, I?ll be 
moving this into the main www.jos.org page April 22, 1999.

What do people think about me adding the navigation box at the left to 
the wiki templates so it appears in all wiki pages?

Yes it is a must. Being about to move to important section of a Web site
from any pages is very important for its success. 

Some comment about the front page. It looks a bit packed. Maybe adding more
white space between the top heading and the navigation bar and between the
navigation bar and  main text would improved the look. Otherwise, very nice
work!

I'm currently fixing this problem. The directories that are failing

Don't run that. Do this instead:

Bernoit, you should be able to checkout everything from cvs now - just
run "cvs co jos", or whatever module you want. If you still get errors,
try removing the whole jos directory and try checking out again. If you
already have a great deal downloaded and you don't want to remove what
you've got, try this:

rm -rf jos/library/org/jos/server
cvs update -d jos

Tell me if that works and I'll send out a message to the public mailing
lists.

Thanks.

As I'm the creator of this Wiki and know it rather well therefore, I
think
that maybe doing this with frames is the better idea. Otherwise the
navigation
box maybe interferes with the Wiki content and I do not want that
somebody
accidently damages the navigation bar with his Wiki page.

OK.  I've actually been working on it using php and postgresql but if you 
can think of a nice way to integrate it directly into Wiki that would be 
cool too.  To avoid redundant work, we should coordinate efforts.  
Speaking of Wiki:

1. I've noticed the Wiki pages are set up for revisions of pages but its 
not actually being done.  Any plans on getting this implemented? Or is 
it and I'm just not seeing it?

2. Helmut has noticed that the Wiki is a processor hog.  I've noticed 
that there are typically < 10 changes a day to the wiki.  Perhaps 
instead of doing the processing everytime a page is displayed (which 
presumably happens often) we do the normal "view" processing for a 
page everytime a page is changed (and unfortunately update all the 
pages everytime any page is added/deleted (can a page be deleted 
through the wiki?) which presumably happens even less often).  So Wiki 
basically only runs when a change or add/delete are done.  It generates 
static pages that are used whenever a wiki page is viewed.  The 
algorithm you'd have to develop to scan/update all pages when a new 
wiki page is created (to update links) could also be used to auto-
generate a comprehensive wiki index which is sorely needed.  Also a 
Wiki search?

3. The wiki seems inherently hard to organize because its basically a 
one layer deep, extremely bushy tree.  We basically have 6 braches:
[JOS] [KAFFE] [KORE] [JAS] [RTEMS] [PSI] 
with jos having the vast lion's share of pages 

Branch: Page Count
==============
JOS           1249
KAFFE       7
KORE        3
RTEMS      3
PSI            3
JAS           8

Can you think of anyway for us to define "parent" page(s) for each page 
so that they will show up in a heirarchy?  I suppose wiki could simply 
move each file to a subdirectory when moved in the wiki system.  And 
then at the top of each wiki page could be a "navigation line" similar to 
the one they use on big sites like Yahoo.com (i.e.  
"Location:  JOS -> WorkingGroups -> KernelGroup -> MicroKernel"
with each step in the list being a link to the appropriate page).

4.  Do you (Markus) have time to hack Wiki or should I help?  Since you 
wrote wiki you can probably make these changes really fast but if you

Not if its static (which I think is a "good idea").  It should only point to 
major "stable" sections of the wiki to be useful so I don't see a problem 
with putting it into the template.  Check out:

http://jos.org/wiki/view/test/main

Where I've hacked a pre-existing template to include a navigation bar.  If 
we use SSI instead of hard coding it in like I've done there, we can 
simply edit one "master" navigation bar code fragment and it will show 
up in all wiki templates... and hence all wiki pages.  I was thinking of 
doing it for the "static" front end web pages anyhow.

(for test purposes only, that section of the wiki will be up and down and 
deleted so don't put things you want to keep there).

	I motion that Kaffe, Kore, RTEMS, PSI, and JAS be dumped under a
page in the JOS heirarchy, or put together under an 'other products'
category.  Two things about the horizontal nav-bars: I'm not sure that the
bottom one would add all that much, even if reorganized to include links
more oriented towards developers browsing the tree*.  My complaint about
the top one is that it's too wide -- [Changes] is always left hanging
alone by itself on the next line.  Something like moving the 'glossary'
and 'readings' under the FAQ link and renaming it 'help' (or something)
would take care of the problem.

	But I'm not a web designer.  BTW -- how's the 'front-end' coming
along?  Wasn't there some motion toward making a site off the wiki to
serve people interested in (getting) JOS but not helping with it?

* As it stands now, I can't figure out *why* it's down there.  It doesn't
seem to add much of any use.  The best use for it *I* can think of is
links to the 'home pages' for various packages/distributions in/of JOS.
Otherwise, just toss it.

Check out OpenPortal; it is like a Wiki but has nestable categories so
that pages can contain pages.  So for example in Wiki a Wikiname might be
MostRecentChanges, but in OpenPortal you could have a Wiki name such as
/JOS/Projects/Kernel/Most Recent Changes (names can have spaces in
OpenPortal).  Link services will automatically hyperlink to this page.  In
OpenPortal pages can also return output, so that one page can 'call'
another page as if it were a function and it could return output.  See
www.openportal.org for the user interface templates.  OpenPortal will be
released in June under the GPL, and is in 100% Pure Java using servlets.

Hmmm. I'm not sure about this, but doesn't the RFC that defines the URL
explicitly forbid spaces in URLs? If so, one would have to remember to not
use that feature of OpenPortal to maintain maximum compatibility.

The space simply must be converted to %20 - actually all characters can
be present in URLs as long as they are encoded that way. JOS handles
spaces, too,
by the way (it was actually the first wiki to do so ) - but you have to
explicitely create the link with a special command - and that way you
lose
much of what wiki is about.

Looks great!  I had wondered what you disappeared to do.  :)  So, 
should we simply wait until OpenPortal is ready to go (and just hack the 
current Wiki to hold us over)?  :)

Seriously, I have some concerns regarding it:

It appears to have all the new features we've been discussing.  However, 
does it have all the old features?  For instance, in Wiki you simply write 
a WikiName and its automatically linked (or a link to a potential new 
page is generated).

Does it have facilities for easily creating FAQ's and project  
news/updates/status reports?  Or are those planned?  This was one of 
the "new" things I had wanted to add to JOS's web site.

Does it support versioning of pages (or is this planned)?

I know you're still building the first prototype so things are a bit shakey 
and you probably have a long wish list too.  Just wanted to get as much 
info as possible.  I'd hate to do a lot of work on the current JOS web site 
now only to have the effort become redundant in two months.  :)

I second the motion.  All in favor?  Unless there are serious objections 
I'll do this on Thursday, April 22 when I migrate the new jos front page in.

Agreed.  If I roll all the other wiki's into the main jos wiki, the bottom 
horz nav bar will go away.  (maybe to be replaced by links to major 
working group pages but initially just removed).

Agreed.  Plus, I'd like to auto generate the "glossary" and call it an 
"index".  The glossary should be an annotated index (but if the index is 
autogenerated we'd need to come up with a specialized method of 
annotating it so that the annotations "stick" between re-gen).

Yes.  The first crude prototype is available for review at 

http://www.jos.org/test/

It obviously needs more content but its available now to see if the 
structure is what we're looking for.

When converted to URLs the spaces are turned into + (pluses), which is
appropriate to the RFC spec.  So the above url would be
/JOS/Projects/Kernel/Most+Recent+Changes

It will be available in June under the GPL in 100% Pure Java.

Yes.  OpenPortal has extensive automagic linking services, which is what I
call the Wiki names in Wiki.  OpenPortal has something called Easy Command
Language (ECL), which let's you do some cool stuff.  The simplest example
would be ["Main Page"], where the brackets indicate to the system that
this is an ECL phrase.  This would be typed into a textarea box while
editing a page.  The quotes say that this is the name of a page (this
replaces the Wiki name idea.  So the system would automatically turn the
phrase ["Main Page"] into a hyperlink that links to the page with the name
"Main Page".

Here's another example of ECL.  To make your own menu along the side of a
page in OpenPortal, you would enter the following in the html through an
edit box or in a template file:

Menu
----
[Edit this Page]
[Delete this Page]
[Clone this Page]
[Send Email to Author of this Page]

OpenPortal's automagic system would automatically turn these into the
correct hyperlinks to tell the openportal system to initiate these
commands when clicked on by the user.

Another cool ECL command is to put your email address between brackets at
the bottom of an OpenPortal page, such as [bkn3@columbia.edu].  What this
does is that every time the page is edited the OpenPortal system scans
the page and sends email to anyone who has their email address in brackets
on the system.  [bkn3@columbia.edu] is shorthand Easy Command Language for
[on change bkn3@columbia.edu].

One more cool ECL phrase is that you can use ownership terms instead of
exact web page names.  So I could type the following into an edit form:

Make sure to check out [My Home Page]

and the system will convert it into the special form using whoever was
the user who entered the MY part into the edit form:

Make sure to check out [My {Brad Neuberg} Home Page]

The sentence would print out on the screen as

Make sure to check out _My Home Page_

where the underscores are a hyperlink.  Anything between the {}s are not
printed out.

Yes.  OpenPortal supports something called weblets, which are sorta like
server-side javabeans.  An example weblet would be a business card.  A
weblet is a data-object that has data for certain properties, so for the
business card this would be a Name, Organization, Phonenumber, etc.  A
weblet also provides facilities to edit and change this data-object
through a web interface, so that the weblet would provide an html form to
change this data object.  One can add a new weblet to a page by using Easy
Command Language.  To add a business card to a page I could type the
following in the edit box:

Make sure to check out my [BusinessCard].

When I saved the page the page would reload with a blank business card
embedded as html into the openportal page, with a tiny edit button next to
it.  When I hit the edit button I would get a form with fields for the
name, organization, phone number, etc.  One can have as many weblets on a
page as they want:

Everyone, please check out the [Schedule].  Also make sure to append your
contact cards here:

  [Brad Neuberg's Contact Card]
  [Ward Cunningham's Contact Card]
  [Markus Peter's Contact Card]

Please read the FAQ below:

[FAQ]

Since weblets can be any sort of structured data, a FAQ Weblet could also
be created.  Weblets are really just JavaBeans with a web interface to
display and edit them.

> Does it support versioning of pages (or is this planned)?

Not right now.  Eventually CVS integration is planned (this would be
OpenPortal 3).  OpenPortal 2 is what is being released at the end of June.
