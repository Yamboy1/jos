I did not mean to imply that a smalltime software author should not be
given commit access for their own project. What I meant to say was every
project leader should be given a CVS account, and possibly additional
trusted developers under the project leader.

&gt;<i> So I am hoping that there's an easy way (i.e. automated) to allow

</I>&gt;<i> which they become the commit admin for.
</I>
I agree.

&gt;<i> They have no special access to
</I>&gt;<i> any other part of the CVS, just their own.  They have the power to
</I>&gt;<i> grant commit priviledges for others (to invite other trusted developers
</I>&gt;<i> into the project) and to revoke them.  Is this possible?
</I>
Yes, but eventually I'd like to try a double repository model - one
repository for the masses and one repository for very important code
that we can't risk being destroyed by crackers. - or some other model
that protects very important code. 

&gt;<i> &gt; There may be other ways - you're welcome to think of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any. Perhaps we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could have two CVS servers - one for main
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developers, and another for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; untrusted developers. It would *somehow* be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; automatically updated to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reflect changes in the main repository. I don't see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this happening any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time soon though :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think this will work so well.  Perhaps a separate CVS for the
</I>&gt;<i> kernel and one for the rest if security is a major issue...
</I>
I don't know the best way to organise multiple cooperating repositories,
but it's an interesting idea.
