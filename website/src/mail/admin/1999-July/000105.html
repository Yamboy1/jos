Yeah.  I know what you mean about no time!  ;)  I may dig into the
MailMan sources then... I'm also going to investigate how difficult it
would be to move our announce list to mailman. I know that its still at
spin because of the huge subscription... 

However, I did some reading on list software and the primary reason
that Mailman-like software can't handle it is because you typically
want the entire list to recieve mail at the same time (or close to it).
 This is not a problem for us because the only really big list we have,
is one way.  Extremely low traffic announce only.  

So, even a timed perl script that slowly chugs through the list, giving
sendmail breaks between blocks would get the list out... Of course it
may be a day or more between the first people getting emails and the
last but who cares?  It may actually be good because then our website
won't get slaughtered if we make an announcement and 20,000 people hit
the site at once!  :)  Yeah, optimistic but possible.

Anyhow, it would really be nice to centralize the lists.  I was also
hoping to add list creation capabilities to &quot;project lead&quot; accounts so
that each project could create a private, announce, and public mailing
list specific to their project...
