Java is not the best language for implementing dynamic HTML user
interfaces. Perl is not either. The best language for doing this is
HTML. The fact that you can embed HTML inside perl programs is what has
made perl so successful for generating dynamic HTML content, but the
intermingling of HTML and perl throughout the same source file is far
from elegant, IMHO. I support Rogier Avery's suggestion to use JSP which
allows you to separate the user interface (written in HTML) from the
backend (written in Java). If you want, it still allows you to
intermingle HTML and Java in the same source file.

Your second concern was that servlets/JSP would be too slow. Given that
a servlet/JSP page access does not invoke the Java interpreter each time
(as with perl), and given that servlet/JSP is able to cache pages
(.class files) for faster access, I doubt execution speed is a problem.
However, memory usage may be an issue to investigate. I believe the
caching is configurable (any one know?), and the JVM itself can be given
a maximum heap size. The advantage is that there is only ever one
instance of the JVM running, so much of the bloat inside the JVM only
gets loaded once.

The obvious reason to go with Java, though, is that we can be sure to
find a Java programmer to write any code that is required :-) {{ This
