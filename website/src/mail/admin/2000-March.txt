Subject: [JOS-Admin] Source Server

I have been thinking about this:

What prevents us from replacing the Source Server?

1. We cannot shutdown Source Server until we have a corresponding
replacement. We don't have one yet. On the publishing side, we almost have
a feature-for-feature replacement for Source Server. On the contribution
side, we don't have anything.

2. Source Server sorts for interfaces, exceptions, errors, abstract classes
and classes. WebSource does not. How does Source Server do it? We should
put this feature in WebSource.

3. When we shutdown Source Server, there must be a corresponding /source
page that points to its replacement. Could requests for
http://www.jos.org/source be redirected?

4. Source Server enables you to download one source file at a time.
WebSource does not. WebSource does not yet publish a plain-text, non-HTML
version of each source file. An entire product is download-able as an archive.

5. The scope of the WebSource project has exceeded the Source Server. I
have included source code that has been submitted through CVS, Source
Server and individual archives.

6. Any member of the JOS Project can publish a product. If it is announced
on a mailing list or JOS Wiki page, it should be published on the
www.jos.org server, shouldn't it?

-----

It is easy to browse the Java source code for the Java project. The "home"
page for browsing is

<URL:http://www.jos.org/redist/src/>

I have been contacting individual authors to let them know their source
code is published on-line. Many have been glad to see it. They have been
working on their code but can't publish it on the www.jos.org server
because Source Server is "broken".

-----

Just announced on the JOS Project website, WebSource is available for
immediate download. It is free-license and open-source. It created these
static source pages.

WebSource is compatible with Java servlet technology, too. A servlet is
planned. Source code in its original form (.java) can be published
dynamically as syntax-highlighted HTML pages. The WebSource servlet
requires Java 1 Platform and the Java Servlet Development Kit (JSDK).

If the WebSource servlet is running on the same machine with
/redist/mirror, it is possible to dynamically publish directly from .zip or
.jar archives.

There have been two ideas for this so far (that I know of):

1. Iain and I were going to write a user-friendly wrapper around CVS.
2. Someone proposed that we move to SourceForge. 

I am no longer sure how I would prefer to do it.

Let's look at some requirements:

1. Serious developers need full CVS capabilities and control over who
can edit their files.
2. The rest would just like to upload their changes without any hassles.

So, it looks like whichever proposal we choose, we are going to need two
separate repositories with different levels of security and different
management tools.

I am imagining a system in which serious/trusted developers are given
write access to selected parts of the developers' repository, while
everyone has write access to the contributors' repository. Some how,
official updates to the developers' repository are propagated to the
contributors' repository while leaving contributors' changes intact. CVS
(indirectly) provides the ability to do this.

If a contributor has contributed something that they think should be
integrated into the official version, an official developer will copy
the changes made to the contributors' tree and apply them to the
developers' tree.

In order to support automatic synchronisation of the two repositories,
the new SourceServer (the public contributors' repository) should be
based on CVS.

This is just a half-baked idea as yet. I need to think more before I
know it will work.

The changes I'm making to your parser might make that easier to
implement.

I see a number cooperating components:

1. The developers' repository
2. The contributors' repository
3. Publishing tools for (2)
4. cvsweb (serves text/plain source files in CVS over HTTP)
5. WebSource (converting source files to HTML)
6. Javadoc

If WebSource needs to display plain text, it can link to cvsweb. If it
wants inline publishing and downloading capabilities, it can link to the
other systems, written in other programming languages.

SourceServer itself does not HTML'ify java files, it cooperates with
PrettyPrinter to do that. In the same way, WebSource does not need to
implement all of the functionality; Other components can take care of
that.

See above.

Do you mean java->HTML conversion on the fly?

Subject: [JOS-Admin] [Wiki] Article Names

Once again, it is time to update pages A-Z. Pages A-Z are intended to be a
complete list of all Wiki articles.

Where can I find a list of all Wiki Article names?

As I read through the Wiki pages, I wrote down the names of every article I
read. And since October, I have been monitoring the changes page and
writing down all of the articles that have changed. That's how I updated
the pages A-Z.

Articles are missing. How many are missing? What are they? If I had a list
of all articles, I could manually update pages A-Z.
