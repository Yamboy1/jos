<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> .. BUT the external program &quot;ssh&quot; must conform to certain rules that CVS
</I>&gt;<i> expects. I do know that the standard rsh that comes with Windows NT does
</I>&gt;<i> not work in this way and you must download another version that works
</I>&gt;<i> with CVS. Hopefully there is a version of ssh that works with CVS on
</I>&gt;<i> windows.
</I>
I believe there is.  For Windows users, head over to 
www.enhydra.org and pick up the windows GNU tools bundle they 
provide for working with Enhydra.  Oh, and while you're there, 
check out Enhydra (open source java application server).  It's 
another nice tool to add to every java savvy web programmer's 
toolbox.  Anyhow, their bundle of GNU tools specifically was 
designed to allow gnu make files written for unix systems to 
operate properly under windows (so it includes a windows bash 
shell too!!!)... AND to allow ssh CVS access to their secured cvs 
server.  I have not actually tried to use it to access the sourceforge 
cvs server... I guess if/when we setup the jos cvs under 
sourceforge, i can test the setup and then provide a write up in the 
wiki.  If anyone has used this, please let me or Ryan know.

&gt;<i> The importance of having windows clients work is that, while everyone
</I>&gt;<i> involved in kernel development naturally runs linux, people writing high
</I>&gt;<i> level Java code will probably be running an easier to use OS such as
</I>&gt;<i> Windows. The irony is that these people will find it much harder to get
</I>&gt;<i> CVS working, if indeed they can get it working.
</I>
I agree that we definitely want to allow Windows users to 
participate.  I do believe that the sourceforge structure is designed 
to try and keep projects as small and focused as possible.  For 
example, there is only one list of developers per project.  You 
either have commit access to the cvs tree or you don't.  We don't 
necessarily want the people working on a driver to have commit 
access to the kernel right?  So, it would seem logical that each 
&quot;product&quot; (which comes down to source that a single &quot;cvs commit 
group&quot; should have access too) should be broken up into a 
separate sourceforge project.  We'll then tie all the separate 
sourceforge projects into the overall jos project through our website 
and the wiki.

Eventually, if we have the time and resources to fork off a clone of 
sourceforge and run it ourselves, our JOSSourceForge becomes 
the overall jos project and all the projects within the 
JOSSourceForge are sub-products of the project... hmmm, did that 
make sense?

&gt;<i> But if I can ignore the hardship of windows users for the moment, I
</I>&gt;<i> think SourceForge is a great idea. As the current JOS CVS administrator,
</I>&gt;<i> I certainly find the level of automation attractive. It does not have
</I>&gt;<i> some features that I planned for JOS CVS but since SourceForge itself is
</I>&gt;<i> open-source, it should be possible to introduce new features into
</I>&gt;<i> SourceForge. The alternative is to fork SourceForge and host our
</I>&gt;<i> modified version on jos.org.
</I>
Ryan, I know the sourceforge developers are actively accepting 
improvement suggestions for the site and will probably be more 
than happy to either take the idea, or, even better, the source diffs 
to make improvements to any of their services.

I wouldn't count on us hosting a modified sourceforge on our site for 
a while.  From what I've seen, they've heavily modified several 
relatively large packages (like rewriting parts of cvs, mailman, etc) 
and the site is designed to run on something like 10 machines so 
hosting it ourselves will be a good amount of work.

&gt;<i> Now, someone whois windows enabled should probably investigate the ssh
</I>&gt;<i> with CVS issue. Also, has anyone yet registered with SourceForge and
</I>&gt;<i> checked out the user interface?
</I>
I've registered and checked out the site as a user.  It's very nice 
and intuitive.  I also like the extremely active user and developer 
community that has sprung up around it which is very encouraging 
for future quality and features.

I'm planning on waiting until sunday, and if no major objections 
appear, I'll setup the jos project in sourceforge (we can always still 
decide not to use it), and start migrating data over to it.  Then, with 
both the old site and the new sourceforge site running in parallel, 
we can see how sourceforge works for us (especially the 
developers doing check ins...).
