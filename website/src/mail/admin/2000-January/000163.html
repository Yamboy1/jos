<PRE>Hello all from the JOS webmaster,

The JOS website has been pretty quiet lately as I've been very 
busy with other work.  So I thought it would be a good time to send 
an email explaining what's been happening, and what's coming up 
for the JOS website.  I'm going to cover things in reverse 
chronological order (future, present, past) since members that have 
been keeping up to date probably can skip the past section 
completely, skim the present section, and should read and 
comment on the future proposal.

A future proposal: SourceForge
########################################
JOS is a project that concentrates on building a Free Java Based 
Operating System.  As such, most of us aren't that interested in 
building large amounts of web infrastructure to support this massive 
project.  To date, we have been hosting and maintaining our own 
web resources (i.e. website, wiki, mailing lists, cvs, etc) with 
varying degrees of success.

Enter www.sourceforge.net.  This is a new, free website and 
service hosted and sponsored by VALinux to support Open Source 
projects of any kind.  Please check it out.  

SourceForge basically provides the following free:
Web page hosting
Secure CVS (with anonymous checkouts)
Message Boards
Mailing Lists (with message archiving)
Bug Tracking
Feature Request Tracking
Binary upload (to trusted members)/download (anonymous ftp)
Automated Surveys

The benefits of using SourceForge:
They have at least 2 full time developers working on SourceForge
	Bugs are removed quickly
	new features are constantly added
24/7 monitoring of the system
Automated backups
Much higher capacity to handle a &quot;slashdot effect&quot;
	(something I expect to happen when we announce a beta
	test kernel)
I can spend my time (as webmaster) on building and organizing
	_content_ in our website rather than working on infrastructure.

Possible drawbacks
Loss of 100% control of our resources
	We can always grab our data and move...
Loss of ability to gain revenue through advertizing on our website
	We're not taking advantage of this now.  When this becomes
	a serious issue, we can move the site...

So I propose moving most of our current resources to SourceForge. 
I'm envisioning a 3 phase website plane.  The first phase is to move 
most of our &quot;common&quot; website resources to SourceForge.  The 
second phase is to integrate our custom code (wiki and a rewritten 
SourceServer) into SourceForge (either having SourceForge adopt 
it as standard components for their overall site software or 
integrating it just into &quot;customized web&quot; section of our 
SourceForge area.  Finally (and this phase may never come 
about), clone SourceForge on our own machines and move our site 
and all JOS related sites to a separate SourceForge site clone 
(let's call it JOSSourceForge) so that we have one 
JOSSourceForge for JOS projects (this would also allow us to gain 
revenue from advertizing if we decide to go that route).  Obviously 
phase three is only if we get really ambitious and feel that the JOS 
project needs that additional control.

For phase one, I propose moving everything except for wiki and the 
disabled SourceServer to a SourceForge account.  This would 
include:

CVS (they just require a tar ball of the CVSROOT and they'll
	install it into the custom SourceForge CVS).
Mailing Lists (I believe we can set it up to continue using the same
	list email addresses)
Main Web Page (Host it at SourceForge but keep the www.jos.org
	DNS entry and simply point it at the SourceForge hosted
	page(s)

We also activate and use the new features the SourceForge offers 
(i.e. bug tracking and message forums).  We keep the wiki as a 
standalone system (with its own unique user names and 
passwords) until I can figure out a way to get it integrated into 
SourceForge.  This will have to wait on SourceForge giving us 
access to their session management info which they say is 
something they're working on.

In Phase two, I work on integrating the standalone wiki into the 
SourceForge site (hopefully making it a standard part of 
SourceForge).  In addition, we add a rewritten SourceServer for 
people that don't like to use CVS (which seems to be a lot of 
people).

So comments please.  Does this sound like a good idea?

Current Status
########################################
I've finished a _beta_ version of the new jos wiki which is available 
at 

<A HREF="http://www.metamech.com/jos/">http://www.metamech.com/jos/</A>

Please check it out.  The site also includes a new, automated user 
registration feature and gives our site the ability to track user 
sessions (which should open the door to more advanced web 
capabilities).  This mimicks the session management that exists in 
SourceForge, hopefully making it easy to integrate into 
SourceForge in the future.  So, if you want to test the new Wiki's 
editing capabilities, first go to the &quot;Account&quot; area of the site, and 
register yourself.

NOTE: Since this is a beta site, I expect to purge the user account 
database and all wiki pages created in the test wiki before moving 
our existing wiki pages into the new system.  So don't put 
documents in there you want to save.  Also, please report bugs to 
me (<A HREF="mailto:webmaster@jos.org">webmaster@jos.org</A>)!  Hopefully we can get the problems 
ironed out and move the old wiki pages into the new wiki system 
asap.


A breif history
########################################
This past year has been a bit chaotic for the JOS website.  During 
an update of the Wiki made this summer, features were added 
(namely searching) that opened the Wiki to overload from spiders.  
This resulted in us getting the Wiki kicked off our normal webserver 
(understandably so).  Since most of the web team was vacationing 
out of town, this down time was longer than it should have been.  

Most of the JOS project's web pages are in the Wiki and so, 
getting access restored to those pages was critical.  Our quick fix 
was to move it to the first server we had access to that could 
accomodate the Wiki software.  This ended up being my server on 
www.metamech.com.  The relocation was intended to be very 
temporary.  That was the beginning of the fall (er, fall season, not 
the fall of the website).

I began to try and address the problems in the Wiki by doing a 
rewrite to eliminate the major problems.  This was primarily 
targetted at reducing server load by caching page renders (our wiki 
currently &quot;renders&quot; each wiki page everytime its viewed), and 
making wiki page searches easier.  Due to time constraints, this 
task took much longer than I expected.
