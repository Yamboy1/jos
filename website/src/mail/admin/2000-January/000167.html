SourceForge implements secure CVS over ssh. On linux, you simply type:

	$ export CVS_RSH=ssh

If you're running windows you can also set this variable with:

	C:\WINDOWS&gt; set CVS_RSH=ssh

.. BUT the external program &quot;ssh&quot; must conform to certain rules that CVS
expects. I do know that the standard rsh that comes with Windows NT does
not work in this way and you must download another version that works
with CVS. Hopefully there is a version of ssh that works with CVS on
windows.

The importance of having windows clients work is that, while everyone
involved in kernel development naturally runs linux, people writing high
level Java code will probably be running an easier to use OS such as
Windows. The irony is that these people will find it much harder to get
CVS working, if indeed they can get it working.

But if I can ignore the hardship of windows users for the moment, I
think SourceForge is a great idea. As the current JOS CVS administrator,
I certainly find the level of automation attractive. It does not have
some features that I planned for JOS CVS but since SourceForge itself is
open-source, it should be possible to introduce new features into
SourceForge. The alternative is to fork SourceForge and host our
modified version on jos.org.

Now, someone whois windows enabled should probably investigate the ssh
with CVS issue. Also, has anyone yet registered with SourceForge and
checked out the user interface?
