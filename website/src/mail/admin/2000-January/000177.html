<PRE>Hello,

First a short note.  This discussion only belongs on the biz list.  So 
please, only reply to, and continue this discussion on the biz list.

I would like to bring another issue (other than the JOS License) up 
for consideration.  This is something I'd like to discuss with the 
hope that we can eventually put it up for a vote.  

It seems to me that we should decide whether to create an 
&quot;official&quot; minimal administrative structure to allow us to conduct 
business (this may be something we don't want to do but I think 
should be voted on one way or the other).

Establishing JOS Admin

I would like to propose and get a vote on whether JOS should be 
run like a non-profit org. business, or continue to be a non-entity as 
far as business concerns go.  My primary motivation is to 
determine, one way or the other, if we should open a JOS bank 
account.

If we remain a non-business entity, we save ourselves from the 
administration hassles, having to have a board (i.e. president and 
treasurer etc), board meetings, and we can continue operating as 
we have been.

If we become a business entity (a non-profit business organization 
I'd imagine), we can establish a bank account, and hopefully 
generate some revenue from advertising or cross-sales (like 
becoming amazon resellers) on the website.  We would also be 
able to accept donations!   The motivation being that we could pay 
for the JOS expenses member are currently incuring (if any) and 
hopefully use the remaining money for JOS.  I'd love to sponsor a 
conference or at least travel expense grants to JOS members so 
that we can have meetings (maybe at JavaOne or the O'Reilly Java 
conference).  That of course is down the line a ways but a 
possbility.

As webmaster, I've become a defacto first point of contact for much 
of the online inquiries regarding issues as wide ranging as cross-
advertising offers, requests for official training materials, 
sponsorships etc.  Most of these offers are nearly impossible to 
pursue without at least having a bank account and an official &quot;head 
honcho&quot;.

On the other hand, there are advantages to not creating any official 
organization behind the official OS.  For instance, we remove a 
large source of possible commercial influence on the OS 
development.

The way I see it, its the difference between the Linux model (which 
has no real business behind it), and the FreeBSD model (which is 
a structured org that pays salaries etc).  IMHO, the Linux model 
works for Linux because they have a very clear leader in Linus (so 
a vision and a final &quot;yes or no&quot; man is present).  Do jm and _quinn 
serve this same function and are they willing to play the role?  
Does someone else?  If not, I think considering a more structured 
FreeBSD model may be beneficial to the project.

Comments?
