<PRE>&gt;<i> We do have an announce list.  It just wasn't moved over to mailman like the
</I>&gt;<i> rest of them because of its high number of subscribers!
</I>&gt;<i> It is at:
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="mailto:jos-announce@spin.de">jos-announce@spin.de</A>
</I>
Aha.  I had a feeling we did.  I'm probably on the darn list and 
completely forgot.  Has any traffic been sent on that list lately?  The 
major problem now is, with the current web organization, there is 
absolutely no chance anyone new will find that list and subscribe.  

Clark, would it be feasible to setup an <A HREF="mailto:announce@jos.org">announce@jos.org</A> list in 
mailman?  I think it will be worth the teething pains to force everyone to 
migrate.  Consistency and all that.  The current navbar points everyone 
to the main mailman page for info on mailing lists and there's no 
mention of the annouce group.

Otherwise, how about we edit the mailman pages on jos.org so it at 
least looks like the spin announce list is part of mailman?  On the new 
front page (it hasn't been posted yet), I've created a link to 
jos.org/mailman/listinfo/announce for people interested in subscribing to 
the announce list.  It would be nice if that worked...  I know I'm being 
demanding.  :)
