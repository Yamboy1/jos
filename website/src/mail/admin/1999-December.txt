For additional information, see also JOSDistribution1c and
JOSDistribution1d pages on JOS Wiki.

I have uploaded static HTML pages (Source-Doc) for these "products":

Source Server
JJVM
Smart API - Release 1a
Smart API - Release 1b
Smart API - Release 2a

I do not have an appropriate product-level index. Each "product" has an
index.html file. Source code within a product is cross-linked, as when one
class uses another. HTML pages are stored in a single directory for each
product and do not require Java-like directory tree.

I agree, mostly. The latest source code should be pretty printed to HTML
pages and browse-able on-line. Previous releases should be download-able
and reviewed off-line.

Should we always use jars? I use jars exclusively for .class files, so all
jars can be added to classpath. When I see a jar file, I think run-time
code. I use zips and "tar balls" for .java and other files.

Using Source-Doc, the index for each product is automatically generated.
With additional suggestions for its design, the index.html file could
easily be replaced -- without uploading all of the pretty printed HTML pages.

The product index is currently undefined. It will be /source/index.html.
The product index should provide the following links:

Source Server 1c - srcserv1c/index.html
JJVM - jjvm/index.html
Smart API 1a = smartapi1a/index.html
Smart API 1b = smartapi1b/index.html
Smart API 2a = smartapi2a/index.html

I have been considering the "short description" for a product index. The
product index would be simpler if, in a three column format, it listed the
name of a product, a *link* to product description, a *link* to pretty
printed HTML pages.

Shouldn't product description really be a link to some JOS Wiki page? It
would open up the product description (and review) to any author on JOS
Wiki, not just the author of the product index. The product description
page might provide a *link* to "download now".

The product index might have a single link to a DownloadJOS page.

I like jars simply because everyone with java (I hope that's a 
reasonable min requirement for JOS members) should have access 
to jar/unjar capabilities.  Since zip is jar (or more accurately jar is 
zip) I suppose we can use zip for source and jar for binaries.  

However, I think its better to come up with a naming convention 
and stick with using the .jar extension for all archives.  It _feels_ 
like a better solution.

I think both should be present.  A link to a wiki page AND an 
optional separate product discription that would go with the 
distribution.  The separate product description (if used) would hold 
"canonical" information that should not be changed without the 
source project itself being changed (even if only to change the 
product description).  I would imagine this type of information might 
include copyright and license notification (especially now since we 
don't have a standard JOS source license), credits, references, etc.

Hello all,

First, I'm moving this discussion over to the admin list.  Please 
direct your followups there.

I think it looks really nice too.  There are many things that still 
need to be worked on (that's why its still a 0.x release) but there's 
a lot of power already in place, and many promising developments 
on the way.  Definitely something we should keep our eyes on.  
For JOS, I see two potential stumbling blocks. 

First, we'll need to get the wiki ported in order to move the entire 
site over to sourceforge.  We certainly can just host what 
sourceforge offers (CVS, ftp, etc) at sourceforge and keep the wiki 
on a separate server.  However, linking everything together with a 
single user id would make it worth it to port.  The main impediment 
to this right now is sourceforge is very new, and they haven't 
designed a way for us to access the session and user login 
information from sourceforge accounts yet.  It's on their "to do" list 
though.  I've been following the discussion and will try and stay up 
to date on this feature.

Second, sourceforge is designed to host a group of single product 
projects.  We actually should try setting up a separate sourceforge 
system for jos, where the projects in the JOSSourceForge are all 
related to JOS.  This should be possible when sourceforge 
releases their source (which, from the discussions on their site, 
should be "real soon now").  

The advantages being, a nice, tight integration of JOS and its 
applications.  The disadvantages being we have to setup and 
maintain a sourceforge clone.  I like this solution best though as 
we can perhaps do some fund raising with such a site (advertizing 
or becoming amazon.com resellers) to help offset some of the 
costs JOS members are currently shouldering.

The alternative is porting wiki to work in sourceforge, and using 
sourceforge as hosted at valinux.  This way, va linux shoulders the 
costs and pain of setting up and maintaining the site.  We then let 
all the jos projects basically splinter and form their own little 
sourceforge projects and then do something like a web ring to link 
them all under the JOS "umbrella".  A lot less work and will get 
things done sooner rather than later.  It seems like an "ugly" 
solution though.

Are there other alternatives I'm not seeing?  

Oh, and this is not to say sourceforge is THE solution, but we 
basically have to do something like a SourceForge on our own (the 
self hosting option) or try and use someone else's free/inexpensive 
service (the "use SourceForge" option).  There are other services 
like SourceForge out there... but none that I've seen so far that look 
as promising.

I was working on my own version of a site like SourceForge for the 
next version of the JOS website, but now that I've seen what 
SourceForge does (which is almost exactly what I had in mind 
anyhow) I'm thinking that one way or the other, we might as well 
use SourceForge (either on our own site or using their service).  
Opinions?

Cool.  I'm leaning towards waiting and hosting our own clone of 
SourceForge when the source is released (perhaps as late as 
February, they're thinking of releasing it at LinuxWorld).

How many projects would you estimate JOS has in CVS right 
now?  How many developers would you estimate have CVS commit 
accounts right now?  How many for the jjos and decaf stuff?  This 
is just to get a feel for the size of the site.

Thanks.
