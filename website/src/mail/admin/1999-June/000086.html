OK. Despite our excellent community process, its nice
in some situations to be able to point to someone when 
told &quot;Take me to your leader!&quot;.  :)  

&gt;<i> handle general cvs administration tasks including:

</I>
OK.  Could you (Ryan) please contact <A HREF="mailto:kevinr@spin.com.mx">kevinr@spin.com.mx</A>
KevenRaul.  He's writing the CommandLineUtilities
and wants to put them into the CVS and use that
for development.  I've Cc'd him so he may contact
you...

Also, speaking of adding/maintaining CVS accounts,
how hard would it be to automate the process?  I think
we're &quot;scaring&quot; away developers because there are so
many things you need to do to get started.  First 
you need a WikiName and password, then you need to
add yourself to the MemberList, and join the right
mailing lists, and then get a separate CVS account.
I was thinking about trying to create a central
&quot;account&quot; management page/script that will allow
a person to manage all account information in a
single place.  Ideally choose/edit one WikiName,
account info, and password, set some check marks, and everything is
configured.  CVS commit access would have 
to be &quot;approved&quot; by module &quot;owners&quot; for pre-existing
CVS modules, but creating new modules (following
certain rules) should be easy/automatic.  Do you
think this is possible?

&gt;<i> &gt; Of primary importance, is anyone in charge of, or
</I>&gt;<i> interested in being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in charge of SourceServer?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think Thomas Winzig wrote that. I'm not sure who

</I>&gt;<i> anyone here know **anything** about SourceServer?
</I>&gt;<i> (Clark?)
</I>
I hope someone does!  At present it appears broken.
It can read files but can't add any.  
 
&gt;<i> I would like to know one thing about it ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some people have proposed that everything in
</I>&gt;<i> SourceServer be moved
</I>&gt;<i> across to CVS. 
</I>
I'm one of the more vocal in this group.  It's 
confusing where to put source and why.  Once again, 
a finger pointing problem.  When asked, &quot;Where do I 
put my source I want to contribute to JOS&quot;, I'd like 
to have one place to point...

&gt;<i> To do this I need to know how to
</I>&gt;<i> access plain source
</I>&gt;<i> files from SourceServer. I don't think it is
</I>&gt;<i> feasible to move everything
</I>&gt;<i> across in one go - we would need to chase up each
</I>&gt;<i> individual developer
</I>&gt;<i> and create accounts for them. I'd rather create the
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> directories in jos/library as developers are ready
</I>&gt;<i> to move across.
</I>
All the source is in the /source dir of the jos.org
account.  The dir structure is arranged per package
name I believe.  There is a raw (as submitted java
source), java source (pretty printed), and html version 
of each file.  If we could move them over to CVS,
it may be best to do so (just to remove the confusion
of having two source repositories, with no correlation
between what's in which).  I propose simply putting
them in the CVS (the pretty printed version of the
source) with only the CVS admin having commit access
to them.  Then as the authors start contributing,
they can be granted commit access.  Since SourceServer
has been broken since, I believe March 1999, and I
have only had one person ask why its broken, I don't
think the source in the SourceServer is currently
under active development (or if it is, its being
developed outside of JOS).

&gt;<i> &gt; Ideally, we could use the PrettyPrinting code to
</I>&gt;<i> modify
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the webcvs.cgi interface and not have two separate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (redundant?) source repositories.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is something I have been working on. The latest
</I>&gt;<i> version of
</I>&gt;<i> PrettyPrinter does hyperlinking but I still have a
</I>&gt;<i> few bugs to iron out.
</I>&gt;<i> After that I can integrate it into cvsweb.
</I>
Very cool.  Let me know when that's done so I can
announce it on the front page.  I also would like to 
modify the HowToSubmitSoftware and related pages if you 
think that we can move 100% of JOS source to CVS.
Basically, when SourceServer is fully &quot;replaced&quot;.
