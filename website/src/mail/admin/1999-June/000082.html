<PRE>&gt;<i> I did reply to that. I don't know whether you don't remember, or whether
</I>&gt;<i> this is a hint that you're not happy with my service, but here's what
</I>&gt;<i> happened.
</I>
	Honestly, I had forgotten, probably since we haven't had any
problems with the CVS server!  My apologies.

&gt;<i> Back to your comment: &quot;no one's in charge&quot;, you seemed quite happy to
</I>&gt;<i> assume responsibility for the JJOS module so I was happy to have one
</I>&gt;<i> less thing to do. I haven't really touched the JJOS module since it was
</I>&gt;<i> created. If you want someone else to be in charge of managing JJOS,
</I>&gt;<i> that's fine. Administering cvs itself requires another level of
</I>&gt;<i> expertise.
</I>
	The problem is that I don't have *either* level of expertise.  I
really don't know the full capabilities of CVS, and in part that's
because we haven't needed it -- a remote RCS usage has sufficed for us
so far.  As I noted above, since I haven't noticed any problems with CVS,
you're doing a good job administering it.  And I believe the original
question about &quot;who's in charge&quot; was directed at the tree as a whole,
not the individual modules, although I lost that point writing the email.
At any rate, given the amount of work I'm doing to administer the module,
it could just as easily be said that anyone with an account on the jos.org
server is administering the JJOS module :)  Again, my apologies for 
my hastily-written and ill-considered previous reply.

	On the other hand, do you have any good references for CVS module
maintainers?  I imagine I'll like a break from coding up throws pretty
soon.
