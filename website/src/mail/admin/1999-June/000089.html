No worries. I faulted in trying to read your thoughts (I'm not very good
at doing that).

There isn't really any documentation on this because each cvs project is
set up differently. With the way it's set up on jos.org you just need to
know how to create new accounts and grant them permissions (which you
already know how to do). If I change the way it works I will let you
know.

If you read any documentation, you should read a CVS user manual which
describes all the features you might use as a CVS developer. This is
something that all CVS developers should read. You can read
documentation comes with the cvs 1.10 distribution (I haven't checked
1.9). If you don't have it, you can get it from <A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/">http://www.cyclic.com/</A> .
There are also several CVS reference manuals on the web in HTML format.
