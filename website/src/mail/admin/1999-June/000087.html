</I>&gt;<i> think this is possible?
</I>
This would be cool.  I don't have a ton of time
to toss at it, but I think it would be very useful.

&gt;<i> &gt; anyone here know **anything** about SourceServer?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Clark?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope someone does!  At present it appears broken.
</I>&gt;<i> It can read files but can't add any.
</I>
As I understood, we were moving to CVS.  It would
be cool to have some of the SourceServer features
on top of CVS though... this could be a nice
&quot;JavaCVS&quot; project and would be welcome to the
Java development community.

It could also do things like automagically
run JavaDocs and such.

&gt;<i> &gt; I would like to know one thing about it ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some people have proposed that everything in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SourceServer be moved
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; across to CVS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm one of the more vocal in this group.  It's
</I>&gt;<i> confusing where to put source and why.  Once again,
</I>&gt;<i> a finger pointing problem.  When asked, &quot;Where do I
</I>&gt;<i> put my source I want to contribute to JOS&quot;, I'd like
</I>&gt;<i> to have one place to point...
</I>
CVS

Altough a nice submission process would 
be cool.  Did we install webcvs.cgi?

It would be cool to have some way
to have submissions be approved by
someone who is a &quot;committer&quot;.

A patch queue would be slick too,
many projects, like PostgreSQL
could use something like that.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Ideally, we could use the PrettyPrinting code to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; modify
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the webcvs.cgi interface and not have two separate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (redundant?) source repositories.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is something I have been working on. The latest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PrettyPrinter does hyperlinking but I still have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; few bugs to iron out.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After that I can integrate it into cvsweb.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Very cool.  Let me know when that's done so I can
</I>&gt;<i> announce it on the front page.  I also would like to
</I>&gt;<i> modify the HowToSubmitSoftware and related pages if you
</I>&gt;<i> think that we can move 100% of JOS source to CVS.
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, when SourceServer is fully &quot;replaced&quot;.
</I>
Perfect.
