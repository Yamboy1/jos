I did reply to that. I don't know whether you don't remember, or whether
this is a hint that you're not happy with my service, but here's what
happened.

At the time jm sent his email to the list complaining that CVS was not
working, I had just left for a two week vacation. I read his email from
an Internet Cafe and explained the situation. jos.org had just moved to
a new machine shortly before I had to leave - in fact the night before I
was up until 4:00am replicating the old cvs environment on the new
machine. I finally got it working and nodded off. When jm complained
that his remote client wasn't working, I explained (from a distant
Internet Cafe) that the cron job wasn't working properly and where to
find the pserver script. On the old machine, Borko and I would patrol
cvs day and night from opposite sides of the globe but Borko was never
given an account on the new machine and so he couldn't handle things
while I was away. He still does not have an account and he has now left
the jos project (as far as anyone can tell).

As for that cron job, that's still a mystery. Of course a script in
/etc/rc.d would be better. From memory Helmut had something against
that. Debugging cron jobs is pretty time consuming, especially over my
slow link but maybe I'll have another look at it.

Back to your comment: &quot;no one's in charge&quot;, you seemed quite happy to
assume responsibility for the JJOS module so I was happy to have one
less thing to do. I haven't really touched the JJOS module since it was
created. If you want someone else to be in charge of managing JJOS,
that's fine. Administering cvs itself requires another level of
expertise. If you want someone else to take over from that too, that's
also fine. I'll stop when you find someone else.

(I haven't had time to proof read - if I've pissed anyone off, sorry!)
