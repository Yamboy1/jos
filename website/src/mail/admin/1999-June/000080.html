CVS admin requests should be sent to this list. As Todd L. Miller
pointed out, many of us are able to fix most problems so posting to this
list will get the fastest response.

However, I would be what you would call the &quot;cvs admin guy&quot; - if you
need to know.

..

For those who don't know (!!) about a year ago I proposed and installed
(in cooperation with Borko) the JOS CVS server initially for kernel
development. He's disappeared off the JOS scene so I'm the only person
left with cvs administration experience. JM/_Quinn and Robert
Fitzsimmons pretty much handle their own modules these days while I
handle general cvs administration tasks including:

- cvs configuration and maintenance
- creation of top-level modules and any modules under jos/* (including
account creation for new developers under those modules)

Since jm and _quinn are using cvs a lot now we should work out how not
to step on eachother's toes. For example, we don't want two people
editing the same configuration file at the same time.

&gt;<i> Of primary importance, is anyone in charge of, or interested in being
</I>&gt;<i> in charge of SourceServer?
</I>
I think Thomas Winzig wrote that. I'm not sure who took over. Does
anyone here know **anything** about SourceServer? (Clark?)

I would like to know one thing about it ...

Some people have proposed that everything in SourceServer be moved
across to CVS. To do this I need to know how to access plain source
files from SourceServer. I don't think it is feasible to move everything
across in one go - we would need to chase up each individual developer
and create accounts for them. I'd rather create the appropriate
directories in jos/library as developers are ready to move across.

&gt;<i> Ideally, we could use the PrettyPrinting code to modify
</I>&gt;<i> the webcvs.cgi interface and not have two separate
</I>&gt;<i> (redundant?) source repositories.
</I>
This is something I have been working on. The latest version of
PrettyPrinter does hyperlinking but I still have a few bugs to iron out.
After that I can integrate it into cvsweb.
