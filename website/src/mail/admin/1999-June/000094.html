This sounds reasonable.  See below though.

The only problem with this approach is that we really need an active
commit administrator then.  I know that the original setup was intended
to host the kernel and main JOS OS code.  This system works well for
that.

The new problem is we have a ton of little utilities that people write
that should be put into CVS. The utility's author would like to be the
&quot;commit admin&quot; for that utility.  So we would end up with the need for
many small CVS projects managed by many accounts.  The only way around
this is to have a few priviledged commit managers that these utility
authors would have to go through to check files in and out of their
utility's source.  

I think that not giving an author direct control over their own source
(for a separate small project) may be prohibitive.  Both for the author
that does not like to have to go through an approver for their own
code, and for the commit admin that would have to be approving commits
to tons of projects.

So I am hoping that there's an easy way (i.e. automated) to allow
anyone to start a &quot;project&quot; which creates a separate CVS &quot;area&quot; for
which they become the commit admin for.  They have no special access to
any other part of the CVS, just their own.  They have the power to
grant commit priviledges for others (to invite other trusted developers
into the project) and to revoke them.  Is this possible?  

If not, I'm not sure that the general use of CVS for JOS source (other
than central code like the kernel) is necessarily a good idea.  If
things go well, we should be expecting hundreds of separate &quot;OS
support&quot; projects to pop up for everything from commandline utilities,
to little jos desktop clocks and other desktop applets, to
test/analysis tools.  I'm not sure that we can centrally create a
single JOS CVS for all this without fully automating the process.

We my have to have a &quot;you're on your own, just provide links to your
source/binaries&quot; policy like linux has.  And rely on authors to find
their own resources for version control and hosting... or hope that
bundlers like RedHat come along to organize things...

I would much prefer it, if we could, to centralize
these facilities and provide the infrastructure for all the JOS related
sources.

&gt;<i> There may be other ways - you're welcome to think of
</I>&gt;<i> any. Perhaps we
</I>&gt;<i> could have two CVS servers - one for main
</I>&gt;<i> developers, and another for
</I>&gt;<i> untrusted developers. It would *somehow* be
</I>&gt;<i> automatically updated to
</I>&gt;<i> reflect changes in the main repository. I don't see
</I>&gt;<i> this happening any
</I>&gt;<i> time soon though :-)
</I>
I don't think this will work so well.  Perhaps a separate CVS for the
kernel and one for the rest if security is a major issue...

&gt;<i> Do you mean put the pretty printed file in CVS?
</I>
No.  Just the raw source.

&gt;<i> There is no point in
</I>&gt;<i> keeping version history of generated files. We just
</I>&gt;<i> need to put the
</I>&gt;<i> source files in CVS and when pretty printed files
</I>&gt;<i> are out of date and
</I>&gt;<i> need to be regenerated, they can just be written
</I>&gt;<i> over.
</I>
Agreed.  Both the pretty printed source, and generated javadoc would be
replaced when the raw CVS source is updated.
