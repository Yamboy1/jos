Ok, I'll contact him.

</I>
I think it is important to keep cvs accounts separate from wiki accounts
to keep security tight. New CVS accounts are created with the same wiki
name but a different password. I have asked people to encrypted their
desired passwords before sending them to me rather than just sending
plain text.

I also want to keep the number of CVS accounts to a minimum. It is
typical for there to be only a few people with CVS accounts (the inner
circle), while other contributers (the outer-circle) just send in
patches (eg. bug fixes) to the main developers. In our case, each
project leader definately has a CVS account. Other developers for that
project can be given an account if they are trusted.

There may be other ways - you're welcome to think of any. Perhaps we
could have two CVS servers - one for main developers, and another for
untrusted developers. It would *somehow* be automatically updated to
reflect changes in the main repository. I don't see this happening any
time soon though :-)

&gt;<i> CVS commit access would have
</I>&gt;<i> to be &quot;approved&quot; by module &quot;owners&quot; for pre-existing
</I>&gt;<i> CVS modules, but creating new modules (following
</I>&gt;<i> certain rules) should be easy/automatic.  Do you
</I>&gt;<i> think this is possible?
</I>
It might be useful to have some commandline tools to assist with the
administration process. If we have a web interface, any actions the user
wishes to do are postponed until a CVS admin approves the action (via
the commandline).

&gt;<i> All the source is in the /source dir of the jos.org
</I>&gt;<i> account.
</I>
Thanks.

&gt;<i> I propose simply putting
</I>&gt;<i> them in the CVS (the pretty printed version of the
</I>&gt;<i> source) with only the CVS admin having commit access
</I>&gt;<i> to them.
</I>
Do you mean put the pretty printed file in CVS? There is no point in
keeping version history of generated files. We just need to put the
source files in CVS and when pretty printed files are out of date and
need to be regenerated, they can just be written over.
