</I>&gt;<i> Are you sure? Are you saying you want to *replace* the current source

</I>
Yes.  It is still causing problems because it's there (and the docs 
still say you can upload source using it).  So people try and 
download source from it (which is in some places corrupted as you 
have discovered).  And they try and upload source into it (which 
shouldn't work but who knows).

So the best solution seems to me to remove it from the site as 
soon as we have an alternative way of making the source that was 
in it available to people.

We definitely need something to replace it, but in its current state, 
it causes more trouble than its worth.

&gt;<i> If so, we should make some kind of announcement (shouldn't we?). Or, is
</I>&gt;<i> this the list where such announcements are made?
</I>
Yes, we will announce it.  I'll announce the change on the admin 
and general lists as well as on the main web page (www.jos.org).

&gt;<i> Do you have any comments about my idea for multiple products? multiple
</I>&gt;<i> versions?
</I>
I think its a great idea.  We definitely should try and create enough 
product distributions so that you don't have to download stuff you 
don't want.  As far as multiple versions, I would like to make 
historical &quot;snapshots&quot; available as jar's (as well as the latest 
version of each product), and only put the html pretty printed 
source up for the latest version of the source for each product (so 
as to avoid confusion).

&gt;<i> As cautious as every, I think it might be a good idea to create a prototype
</I>&gt;<i> of this new part of the JOS website before committing to it on www.jos.org.
</I>
Yes.  Actually, I was planning on putting it on the www.jos.org site, 
but just not announcing it for a while so that the core members can 
hit it and comment before making a groupwise announcement.  
Sorta an in-house beta.  Are you planning on including the kernel 
sources as one of the products?
