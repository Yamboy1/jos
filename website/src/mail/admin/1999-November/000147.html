<PRE>Hello,

This is getting off topic for the arch list.  I'm cross posting to the 
admin list and setting the reply-to to point there.  Please followup 
to this only on the admin list.

This is what I had in mind too.  :)  It's on the to-do list after getting 
the current next gen website online.  The current next gen website 
is about 80% of the way to beta state.  It's basically going to 
exhibit the same functionality as the current wiki. But the big 
unseen infrastructure addition is a fully integrated user/session 
management foundation.  With this in place, permission issues 
(esp. upload and edit permissions) will be much easier to address 
for things like source repositories.

My experience as webmaster answering questions for JOS is that 
most open source programmers are not comfortable with using 
CVS.  Especially those that are writing small utilities.  (Or those 
that want to download source for anything).  

This is the reason that the SourceServer even with all its 
shortcomings, was so popular.  No CVS tools, no new techniques 
to learn.  Just upload your jar and SourceServer displays source for 
that jar and that's it.  No merging, no client software, no 
updating/commiting etc.  What's in SourceServer is the latest and 
&quot;canonical&quot; version of that source.

The big question is, what should be JOS' &quot;canonical&quot; source 
repository?

IMHO, it should be a tool like SourceServer (let's call it SSTNG for 
SourceServer: The Next Generation) not CVS.  All JOS source 
should be checked into SSTNG, even if that means there's also a 
version in CVS.  The source in SSTNG basically serves as &quot;official&quot; 
snapshots of the JOS source.  This simplifies things for most 
people.

CVS becomes a working repository only used by those projects 
that require collaboration between several developers (such as the 
kernel group) that isn't feasible to handle by more traditional (if less 
technical) methods such as emailing diffs to a &quot;lead&quot; programmer.  
CVS will still allow adventurous and bleeding-edge people to 
anonymously get CVS source that is basically &quot;daily build&quot; source. 

Groups that use CVS appoints a &quot;lead&quot; programmer that 
periodically checks out CVS sources and inserts it into SSTNG.

SSTNG only stores 1 copy of source.  If new source is checked in 
by users with permission, it replaces the version in SSTNG.  This 
follows the behavior of the old SourceServer and keeps things 
simple for everyone.

For record keeping purposes, every so often, someone from the 
distribution group takes a snapshot of the entire SSTNG contents.  
The last x number of snapshots and other &quot;signficant&quot; snapshots 
can then be made available for download.

Within SSTNG itself, we have functionality as per Gilbert's 
suggestions:

You upload source as &quot;distributions&quot;.  For clarity, I'm going to call 
them source jars.  Basically, a jar of all the source needed to build 
a single product (the product being a java application, a library, 
etc).  A source jar can be linked to other source jars to indicate 
dependence on other JOS products (such as shared class library 
jars).

SSTNG handles uploads and downloads at the source jar level.  It 
is up to the &quot;lead&quot; developer(s) how many source files belong to a 
single product (and thus a single source jar).

SSTNG will display source on a source file level via pretty printed 
HTML.  

Each pretty printed source file is linked to the raw source file, and 
its associated source jar.  Anyone is free to view/download source 
file by file via their web browser, or via the entire source jar using 
the link to its associated sourcejar.

For a project you have a &quot;lead&quot; developer or developers that has 
upload permissions to SSTNG for a project.  Each project can have 
as many source jars as they want (within reason).  If you replace 
one of your source jars with a new one, SSTNG delete's all source 
associated with the old jar and replaces it with the new one.  

So to browse source, you first choose a project, then a source jar, 
then navigate via package names.  This does allow for overlapping 
package names/spaces/classes so developers should be careful of 
package name usage.  A JOS Package name reservation system 
is also planned at some really future date for the website...

Each uploaded source jar will be exploded into individual source 
files, pretty printed HTML versions can be auto-generated, as well 
as javadoc'd.

Anything I missed or got wrong?  Let me know.  I'm obviously not 
working on this right now but it is a future project or my list.  If 
anyone wants to help out, let me know.
