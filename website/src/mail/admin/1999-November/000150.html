This is my experience, too. As members of an open source project, we should
develop a hassle-free policy for downloading distributions.

Downloading is a far more frequent activity than uploading (or patching).
Because of its frequency, it should be optimized for our target market to
get in and get out with a minimum of hassle.

Now about Source Server...

I downloaded jos1c_srcserv.tar.Z. I uncompress'd it, something like this:

$ uncompress jos1c_srcserv.tar.Z

Uncompress created jos1c_srcserv.tar.

I untar'd it, something like this:

$ tar xvf jos1c_srcserv.tar *.raw

I am working on the assumption that these .raw files are the original,
unprocessed source code that members of the JOS Project uploaded to the
Source Server.

I wrote a raw package copier in Java to copy all *.raw files to *.java files.

$ rawpackagecopy path=/linux/srcserv package= show=all

I found that jos1c-srcserv is very different from jos1d-srcserv. There are
different packages, different classes, different compiler errors. It's
almost as if Source Server didn't overwrite .java files when a member tried
to overwrite earlier code.

Soon, I'll have jos1c-srcserv-2.tar.Z as a source-code only redistribution
of jos1c-srcserv.tar.Z.

About new source code pages...

If I tar'd and compress'd HTML pages from my off-line syntax highlighter,
could you add them to the JOS website?

I was thinking of a URL, something like this:

1. <A HREF="http://www.jos.org/browse/index.html">http://www.jos.org/browse/index.html</A> contains a list of &quot;products&quot;. A
product is a collection of Java packages. A casual observer from anywhere
on the Internet should be able to start on this page and read all of the
JOS open source code.

2. <A HREF="http://www.jos.org/browse/descriptions.html">http://www.jos.org/browse/descriptions.html</A> contains a one paragraph
description for each package from Source Server.

3. <A HREF="http://www.jos.org/browse/jos1c-srcserv/index.html">http://www.jos.org/browse/jos1c-srcserv/index.html</A> contains a list of
Java packages and classes from the Source Server.

4. <A HREF="http://www.jos.org/browse/jos1c-srcserv/default.BitSet.html">http://www.jos.org/browse/jos1c-srcserv/default.BitSet.html</A> contains the
syntax-highlighted code from default/BitSet.java.

Is there a problem with space? How much free space is on www.jos.org?
