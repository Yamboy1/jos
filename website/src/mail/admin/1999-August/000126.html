1. Helmut would like the Perl scripts off his
   server, as he does not think that perl is
   sutiable programming language for a production
   system.  This item is not up for debate, so
   let's not argue the point.

2. My ISP for my own server moved on the same 
   day as our Wiki failure.  This has caused 
   me no end to grief... he did not tell me
   he was moving, nor has he been good about
   getting it back on line with proper DNS
   entries... thus my time has been focused
   on saving paying customer sites... sorry.

3. My site is back on line now, but I gave
   helmut the wrong IP address, it is at
   140.186.104.247 *sigh*   Helmut is going
   to put a DNS entry for wiki.jos.org pointing
   to this box so that the perl scripts can
   be moved there.

4. A generic user &quot;josdev&quot; is available at 
    140.186.104.247 for those who want to 
   setup the wiki there.  Iain also has access
   to this box.  Unfortunately, the apache is
   virtual hosting... so Helmut's DNS entries
   are required for it to all work.

5. I really don't think there is a problem with
   the perl scripts... I just think it was a
   timing / load problem.  In any case, with
   the scripts more accessable on a Linux box,
   we can make that determination.

6. It would be cool for those who want access to
   140.186.104.247 to use ssh2 (its on port 9292,
   but I'm going to move this to the default port
   soon) as telnet access needs to be shut off 
   asap.

7. After tonight, I'm going to be going to Michigan
   and back to DC for a week... (I'm moving).  And 
   Iain is on vacation....  thus, neither of us
   will be good resources.    I'll be intermittendly
   on and off.

Best,

Clark
