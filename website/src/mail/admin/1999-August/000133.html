<PRE>Hello,

A breif accusation of myself as being the one at fault for the wiki
meltdown, an apology to helmut, and a whimpering defense of the wiki
itself...

Actually the way some of the wiki scripts are setup, a web-bot can make
cgi calls and not know it...  And the scripts will continue to work...

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Has anyone checked to make certain that

</I>
It is not up to date.  This is my fault.  I added the search script and
forgot to update the robots.txt file. Doh.  So its more than possible
that the entire meltdown was due to this, and it was completely my
forgetfulness at fault.  My apologies, esp. to Helmut for bringing down
your server.

&gt;<i> 300 per hour ?????????????
</I>&gt;<i> Forget it. You can do that on your PC.
</I>
Yup.  And with the brain dead search being used by wiki right now, this
would be more than enough to bring the server to its knees.  I knew
that the search was an extremely dangerous feature to add because it
was such an enourmous hog but hoped that the benefits would outweigh
the costs and I'd have time to fix it before it became a problem. 
Looks like I was wrong.

Please do not blame Peter Thoeny.  Search was a feature I added with
the full knowledge that it could cause damage.  On his much smaller
wiki the solution is acceptable.  On ours, it is a weakness that I was
hoping we could live with until it could be patched.  I was wrong.  He
made sure I knew the risks so its all my fault.

&gt;<i> ...........  then maybe it is time you guys used
</I>&gt;<i> this occasion to do a
</I>&gt;<i> major overhaul on yours. 
</I>
Yes.  I'd would like to and the site needs it.  Unfortunately, I just
don't have the time to do it all at once.  So its patches here and
there as I have the time and energy.  Sorry but that's just the way it
is.

Helmut, please accept my apologies for causing you problems.  Is there
any way you can put our site on a box all by ourselves so that if our
site bogs down, it won't take anyone else with us?  Otherwise, I cannot
guarantee that wiki won't do this again to you (in its present or
future forms).  

If you can't (which is very understandable), since we are highly
reliant on wiki, it will probably be in everyone's best interest if we
moved our site to an isolated box somewhere if we can find one.  

If you can, or if you're willing to trust us, please turn on all the
scripts except for the wiki search script.  I believe that the search
script is the culprit and disabling it, should eliminate similar future
problems.  The other scripts should not be causing a problem and are
vital to the operation of our site.

In either case, please post your reply to the <A HREF="mailto:admin@jos.org">admin@jos.org</A> list so we
know your position. 

Thank you.
