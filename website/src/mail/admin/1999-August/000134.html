<PRE>Hi Ian
I am not familiar with the Wiki at all, but if it was set up so that a web
bot that is simply reading some of the ASCII parts of each file, triggers
executables, then that would have happened millions of times before, and
not suddenly started that day. I think you have to look a bit further.

I know, a good shoemaker goes barefoot, and we never have time for our own
tools until they break. However, something broke and just moving it to
another machine won't fix it.

Personally I think even replacing that old Perl search with a modern,
compiled searcher won't be a cure-all. That old search HAS worked OK until
the voting stuff was added. THAT''s the place where I would look for
missing brackets. 

What are the voting related scripts doing? Are they using the Wiki search
and leaving something open ? 

The only other times that I remember recurrent noticeable loads from JOS
they were Python related. They were not dangerously high, just nuisance
level. However, since that is definitely a weak spot, possibly a
combination of your voting scripts and whatever you do with Python drove
the quaint old searcher nuts. 

You have to look at what was new on that day. The web bots have cruised the
site hundreds of times every day since long before Wiki was added. There
was no change in that. If they WERE involved in the meltdown, then you have
to look at what could have suddenly, and for the first time on that day,
mis-interpreted their cataloguing as something else.

Re moving Wiki onto a different machine, I think that is either in progress
or has been completed. Clark would know the details about that.

</I>&gt;<i>Yup.  And with the brain dead search being used by wiki right now, this

</I>&gt;<i>that the search was an extremely dangerous feature to add because it
</I>&gt;<i>was such an enourmous hog but hoped that the benefits would outweigh
</I>&gt;<i>the costs and I'd have time to fix it before it became a problem. 
</I>&gt;<i>Looks like I was wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Please do not blame Peter Thoeny.  Search was a feature I added with
</I>&gt;<i>the full knowledge that it could cause damage.  On his much smaller
</I>&gt;<i>wiki the solution is acceptable.  On ours, it is a weakness that I was
</I>&gt;<i>hoping we could live with until it could be patched.  I was wrong.  He
</I>&gt;<i>made sure I knew the risks so its all my fault.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...........  then maybe it is time you guys used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this occasion to do a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> major overhaul on yours. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yes.  I'd would like to and the site needs it.  Unfortunately, I just
</I>&gt;<i>don't have the time to do it all at once.  So its patches here and
</I>&gt;<i>there as I have the time and energy.  Sorry but that's just the way it
</I>&gt;<i>is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Helmut, please accept my apologies for causing you problems.  Is there
</I>&gt;<i>any way you can put our site on a box all by ourselves so that if our
</I>&gt;<i>site bogs down, it won't take anyone else with us?  Otherwise, I cannot
</I>&gt;<i>guarantee that wiki won't do this again to you (in its present or
</I>&gt;<i>future forms).  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If you can't (which is very understandable), since we are highly
</I>&gt;<i>reliant on wiki, it will probably be in everyone's best interest if we
</I>&gt;<i>moved our site to an isolated box somewhere if we can find one.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If you can, or if you're willing to trust us, please turn on all the
</I>&gt;<i>scripts except for the wiki search script.  I believe that the search
</I>&gt;<i>script is the culprit and disabling it, should eliminate similar future
</I>&gt;<i>problems.  The other scripts should not be causing a problem and are
</I>&gt;<i>vital to the operation of our site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In either case, please post your reply to the <A HREF="mailto:admin@jos.org">admin@jos.org</A> list so we
</I>&gt;<i>know your position. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thank you.
