<PRE>Well, Helmut has wonderfully put wiki.jos.org to point to a Linux box.
I think I made all of the necessary apache changes, so if anyone
would like to move over the wiki, this would be cool.  
In general /home/jos does not have much disk space, but
/cvs does.  So, puting the wikitext under, say /cvs/jos would
be great, regardless if CVS is actually used...

Which gives me an idea.  Instead of having the wiki pages dynamically
generated, perhaps we could do with a several stage approach:

1. A static snapshot of the pages is kept so perl is not used
   for view requests...
2. On update, the file being changed is automagically 
   made into a snapshot version.
3. For new pages, the WikiName of the page added to the 
   end of a newwikipages.txt file
4. Periodically (cron job?) this file is read, and all wiki
   pages are examined to see if they include this new link.
   If so, then they are refreshed during idle cycles.
5. Perhaps a manual way to invoke a refresh is given, but
   this requires a WikiName and password (just like a change)
   ... thus if you are editing 30 pages, you would wait till
   the end of the edits, and then click &quot;update links&quot; or
   something like that...

Thoughts?  This would dramatically reduce sever load since
perl is only used to modify the pages, and not dynamically
generate them all the time.

Best, Clark
