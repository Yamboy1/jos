<PRE>Wiki is down for the third day. This has become a public relations nightmare.

The only thing we cannot do is say nothing. If we do nothing else, we
should change the JOS home page to explain this situation. We should be
forthright. We should let people know that it's going to be down for a
while. We should put a request for additional help and equipment on the
main page.

The vote is out. Since wiki has been unavailable during the critical first
days of the constitution vote, the vote should be postponed and rescheduled.

1. It is acceptable to lose service on a website. Most people will show
empathy and understanding.

2. It is not acceptable to keep silent about it.

Remember: There are parts of the JOS website that are still working. The
mailing list (mailman) still works. The www.jos.org/download page is still
working.

This also shows that our organization is unprepared for a crisis. We missed
an announce mailing list. Who will broadcast a message explaining the
situation?

Even if this technical problem is resolved today, it causes our
organization a lot of political problems. We may look unsophisticated and
foolish. We have worked hard to become more organized over the last two
years. Never give up. We've got to make this work.
