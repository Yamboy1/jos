<PRE>Here is the current situation with the wiki:

We are attempting to move the wiki to a new machine, which will have the URL
<A HREF="http://wiki.jos.org">http://wiki.jos.org</A> .
The wiki itself has been moved over, however the following things remain,
for which I will need the help of someone more intimately familiar with the
beast than I am.  (Iain?!!?!)
   * The wiki pages in RCS need moved over to the new machine.  There exist
6 MB (compressed) of wiki txt files, which I have a sneaking suspicion are
no longer used at all.
   * The wiki.jos.org DNS entry still needs to be set up. (I'm still getting
DNS errors when I try to access it)
   * An apache virtual server will need to be set up on the machine.  (Is
this already done, Clark?)
   * The wiki usernames and passwords will need to be transferred to the new
machine and security on the edit script set up in Apache.  (I am completely
at a loss on this one.)
   * HTML pages will have to have their links updated.
   * Something else I'm sure to be missing

I did what I could last night in the time that I had, however that time is
now up (I leave on a business trip tomorrow).  I can muddle through a
certain amount of it if I have time, but that would probably mean the wiki
would be down for weeks.  I don't think this is acceptable.  :)

Regards,
Avery J. Regier

</I>&gt;<i> Wiki is down for the third day. This has become a public relations
</I>&gt;<i> nightmare.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only thing we cannot do is say nothing. If we do nothing else, we
</I>&gt;<i> should change the JOS home page to explain this situation. We should be
</I>&gt;<i> forthright. We should let people know that it's going to be down for a
</I>&gt;<i> while. We should put a request for additional help and equipment on the
</I>&gt;<i> main page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The vote is out. Since wiki has been unavailable during the critical first
</I>&gt;<i> days of the constitution vote, the vote should be postponed and
</I>&gt;<i> rescheduled.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. It is acceptable to lose service on a website. Most people will show
</I>&gt;<i> empathy and understanding.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. It is not acceptable to keep silent about it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Remember: There are parts of the JOS website that are still working. The
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list (mailman) still works. The www.jos.org/download page is still
</I>&gt;<i> working.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This also shows that our organization is unprepared for a crisis. We
</I>&gt;<i> missed
</I>&gt;<i> an announce mailing list. Who will broadcast a message explaining the
</I>&gt;<i> situation?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Even if this technical problem is resolved today, it causes our
</I>&gt;<i> organization a lot of political problems. We may look unsophisticated and
</I>&gt;<i> foolish. We have worked hard to become more organized over the last two
</I>&gt;<i> years. Never give up. We've got to make this work.
