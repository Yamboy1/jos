It worked now that I removed the file. Was that a server problem or a client
problem? I'm wondering because it said "server aborted".

Will do.

It looks like your copy of the file was incompatible with the server's
version because the server version was improperly updated. The server
file was valid before and after the update but the new version was
incompatible with your old copy. Now that you have a compatible version,
you shouldn't see this error again (I hope).
