Subject: [JOS-Admin] Web site update and future proposal

Hello all from the JOS webmaster,

The JOS website has been pretty quiet lately as I've been very 
busy with other work.  So I thought it would be a good time to send 
an email explaining what's been happening, and what's coming up 
for the JOS website.  I'm going to cover things in reverse 
chronological order (future, present, past) since members that have 
been keeping up to date probably can skip the past section 
completely, skim the present section, and should read and 
comment on the future proposal.

A future proposal: SourceForge
########################################
JOS is a project that concentrates on building a Free Java Based 
Operating System.  As such, most of us aren't that interested in 
building large amounts of web infrastructure to support this massive 
project.  To date, we have been hosting and maintaining our own 
web resources (i.e. website, wiki, mailing lists, cvs, etc) with 
varying degrees of success.

Enter www.sourceforge.net.  This is a new, free website and 
service hosted and sponsored by VALinux to support Open Source 
projects of any kind.  Please check it out.  

SourceForge basically provides the following free:
Web page hosting
Secure CVS (with anonymous checkouts)
Message Boards
Mailing Lists (with message archiving)
Bug Tracking
Feature Request Tracking
Binary upload (to trusted members)/download (anonymous ftp)
Automated Surveys

The benefits of using SourceForge:
They have at least 2 full time developers working on SourceForge
	Bugs are removed quickly
	new features are constantly added
24/7 monitoring of the system
Automated backups
Much higher capacity to handle a "slashdot effect"
	(something I expect to happen when we announce a beta
	test kernel)
I can spend my time (as webmaster) on building and organizing
	_content_ in our website rather than working on infrastructure.

Possible drawbacks
Loss of 100% control of our resources
	We can always grab our data and move...
Loss of ability to gain revenue through advertizing on our website
	We're not taking advantage of this now.  When this becomes
	a serious issue, we can move the site...

So I propose moving most of our current resources to SourceForge. 
I'm envisioning a 3 phase website plane.  The first phase is to move 
most of our "common" website resources to SourceForge.  The 
second phase is to integrate our custom code (wiki and a rewritten 
SourceServer) into SourceForge (either having SourceForge adopt 
it as standard components for their overall site software or 
integrating it just into "customized web" section of our 
SourceForge area.  Finally (and this phase may never come 
about), clone SourceForge on our own machines and move our site 
and all JOS related sites to a separate SourceForge site clone 
(let's call it JOSSourceForge) so that we have one 
JOSSourceForge for JOS projects (this would also allow us to gain 
revenue from advertizing if we decide to go that route).  Obviously 
phase three is only if we get really ambitious and feel that the JOS 
project needs that additional control.

For phase one, I propose moving everything except for wiki and the 
disabled SourceServer to a SourceForge account.  This would 
include:

CVS (they just require a tar ball of the CVSROOT and they'll
	install it into the custom SourceForge CVS).
Mailing Lists (I believe we can set it up to continue using the same
	list email addresses)
Main Web Page (Host it at SourceForge but keep the www.jos.org
	DNS entry and simply point it at the SourceForge hosted
	page(s)

We also activate and use the new features the SourceForge offers 
(i.e. bug tracking and message forums).  We keep the wiki as a 
standalone system (with its own unique user names and 
passwords) until I can figure out a way to get it integrated into 
SourceForge.  This will have to wait on SourceForge giving us 
access to their session management info which they say is 
something they're working on.

In Phase two, I work on integrating the standalone wiki into the 
SourceForge site (hopefully making it a standard part of 
SourceForge).  In addition, we add a rewritten SourceServer for 
people that don't like to use CVS (which seems to be a lot of 
people).

So comments please.  Does this sound like a good idea?

Current Status
########################################
I've finished a _beta_ version of the new jos wiki which is available 
at 

http://www.metamech.com/jos/

Please check it out.  The site also includes a new, automated user 
registration feature and gives our site the ability to track user 
sessions (which should open the door to more advanced web 
capabilities).  This mimicks the session management that exists in 
SourceForge, hopefully making it easy to integrate into 
SourceForge in the future.  So, if you want to test the new Wiki's 
editing capabilities, first go to the "Account" area of the site, and 
register yourself.

NOTE: Since this is a beta site, I expect to purge the user account 
database and all wiki pages created in the test wiki before moving 
our existing wiki pages into the new system.  So don't put 
documents in there you want to save.  Also, please report bugs to 
me (webmaster@jos.org)!  Hopefully we can get the problems 
ironed out and move the old wiki pages into the new wiki system 
asap.


A breif history
########################################
This past year has been a bit chaotic for the JOS website.  During 
an update of the Wiki made this summer, features were added 
(namely searching) that opened the Wiki to overload from spiders.  
This resulted in us getting the Wiki kicked off our normal webserver 
(understandably so).  Since most of the web team was vacationing 
out of town, this down time was longer than it should have been.  

Most of the JOS project's web pages are in the Wiki and so, 
getting access restored to those pages was critical.  Our quick fix 
was to move it to the first server we had access to that could 
accomodate the Wiki software.  This ended up being my server on 
www.metamech.com.  The relocation was intended to be very 
temporary.  That was the beginning of the fall (er, fall season, not 
the fall of the website).

I began to try and address the problems in the Wiki by doing a 
rewrite to eliminate the major problems.  This was primarily 
targetted at reducing server load by caching page renders (our wiki 
currently "renders" each wiki page everytime its viewed), and 
making wiki page searches easier.  Due to time constraints, this 
task took much longer than I expected.

	How does SourceForge handle adding/removing user commit
priviliges?  Assuming it works well, I'm all for the move to
SourceForge; we don't lose anything, really, and we gain quite a bit.

As I understand it, whoever starts the project at SourceForge 
becomes the "superuser" for the project.  They are then free to 
add/delete commit priviledges for users.  I think you can set it up 
so that anyone with commit priviledges (basically those listed as 
developers) then can also add/delete new developers, or you can 
restrict that capability to just the superuser.  The documentation is 
a bit sparse right now so I suspect the only way to really tell is to 
set up an account and try it.  Either way, if we have someone that's 
relatively responsive as the "superuser" then adding and removing 
developers (those with commit priviledges) should be pretty straight 
forward.

SourceForge implements secure CVS over ssh. On linux, you simply type:

	$ export CVS_RSH=ssh

If you're running windows you can also set this variable with:

	C:\WINDOWS> set CVS_RSH=ssh

.. BUT the external program "ssh" must conform to certain rules that CVS
expects. I do know that the standard rsh that comes with Windows NT does
not work in this way and you must download another version that works
with CVS. Hopefully there is a version of ssh that works with CVS on
windows.

The importance of having windows clients work is that, while everyone
involved in kernel development naturally runs linux, people writing high
level Java code will probably be running an easier to use OS such as
Windows. The irony is that these people will find it much harder to get
CVS working, if indeed they can get it working.

But if I can ignore the hardship of windows users for the moment, I
think SourceForge is a great idea. As the current JOS CVS administrator,
I certainly find the level of automation attractive. It does not have
some features that I planned for JOS CVS but since SourceForge itself is
open-source, it should be possible to introduce new features into
SourceForge. The alternative is to fork SourceForge and host our
modified version on jos.org.

Now, someone whois windows enabled should probably investigate the ssh
with CVS issue. Also, has anyone yet registered with SourceForge and
checked out the user interface?

If nobody minds, now might be a good time to restart the version history
from scratch. This will remove any ghost directories that aren't needed
anymore (the directory structure seems to have stabilised now) and
remove any unusual artifacts that shouldn't be there (I've found one),
in case they cause problems in the future. Also, they are running a much
more recent version of CVS so it seems safer to create a fresh
repository in the new version.

Note that we can archive the old CVSROOT and still access its version
history if necessary.

If jm or _quinn would prefer to keep the version history, nothing bad
will probably happen - this is just to be safe.

Thoughts?

(BTW, this is assuming that we move to SourceForge - we might not)

I believe there is.  For Windows users, head over to 
www.enhydra.org and pick up the windows GNU tools bundle they 
provide for working with Enhydra.  Oh, and while you're there, 
check out Enhydra (open source java application server).  It's 
another nice tool to add to every java savvy web programmer's 
toolbox.  Anyhow, their bundle of GNU tools specifically was 
designed to allow gnu make files written for unix systems to 
operate properly under windows (so it includes a windows bash 
shell too!!!)... AND to allow ssh CVS access to their secured cvs 
server.  I have not actually tried to use it to access the sourceforge 
cvs server... I guess if/when we setup the jos cvs under 
sourceforge, i can test the setup and then provide a write up in the 
wiki.  If anyone has used this, please let me or Ryan know.

I agree that we definitely want to allow Windows users to 
participate.  I do believe that the sourceforge structure is designed 
to try and keep projects as small and focused as possible.  For 
example, there is only one list of developers per project.  You 
either have commit access to the cvs tree or you don't.  We don't 
necessarily want the people working on a driver to have commit 
access to the kernel right?  So, it would seem logical that each 
"product" (which comes down to source that a single "cvs commit 
group" should have access too) should be broken up into a 
separate sourceforge project.  We'll then tie all the separate 
sourceforge projects into the overall jos project through our website 
and the wiki.

Eventually, if we have the time and resources to fork off a clone of 
sourceforge and run it ourselves, our JOSSourceForge becomes 
the overall jos project and all the projects within the 
JOSSourceForge are sub-products of the project... hmmm, did that 
make sense?

Ryan, I know the sourceforge developers are actively accepting 
improvement suggestions for the site and will probably be more 
than happy to either take the idea, or, even better, the source diffs 
to make improvements to any of their services.

I wouldn't count on us hosting a modified sourceforge on our site for 
a while.  From what I've seen, they've heavily modified several 
relatively large packages (like rewriting parts of cvs, mailman, etc) 
and the site is designed to run on something like 10 machines so 
hosting it ourselves will be a good amount of work.

I've registered and checked out the site as a user.  It's very nice 
and intuitive.  I also like the extremely active user and developer 
community that has sprung up around it which is very encouraging 
for future quality and features.

I'm planning on waiting until sunday, and if no major objections 
appear, I'll setup the jos project in sourceforge (we can always still 
decide not to use it), and start migrating data over to it.  Then, with 
both the old site and the new sourceforge site running in parallel, 
we can see how sourceforge works for us (especially the 
developers doing check ins...).

Hi everybody

I've been very quite on the mailing lists and wiki lately, but i'm going

So far I don't have any problem with moving over to SourceForge, but I
think we should give it a little more time, just to make sure it's right.

I don't like the idea of setting up lot's of separate sourceforge
projects for the core parts of JOS (kernel, jvm, drivers, class
libraries, etc), I don't mind so much for applications thought.

Anyway I wouldn't imagine there being a big problem adding the access list
functionality, we are currently using with cvs to the sourceforge cvs.

Another thing I noticed in the site FAQ was this.

   Who can host with SourceForge?
   We're trying to keep it simple, and chose to rely on the work of a very
   talented group, the Open Source Initiative.  If your software utilizes
   one of the OSI's approved licenses, we'd love to offer you hosting at
   SourceForge.  Software that falls under other licenses will require
   further scrutiny, but is not altogether ruled out.  In the end, we're
   looking to further Open Source software development, and will approve
   projects accordingly.

We currently don't have a project wide license, I think this is something
we should work on before moving over.

How much time do you think is reasonable?  

I was actually thinking of making the move gradually.  First set up 
the jos project account at SourceForge and turning on the features 
we don't have. Make an announcement, links on the web pages 
and let that settle in.  Then moving CVS to SourceForge.  Then 
moving mailing lists to SourceForge.  Should it all be done at once?

IMHO, applications should definitely go into separate projects (esp 
pure java ones since they are really independent of jos).  As far as 
the more core parts of JOS, I would think minimalizing what's in 
and what's out of the base kernel would be the best strategy.  And 
this would be reflected by what's in the jos kernel project's cvs 
versus what's in separate projects.

If we can design a driver interface for example, that would allow 
people to develop jos drivers separately from the kernel 
development, it would be better for everyone involved.  finding, 
gathering and integrating the separate parts back into a 
distributable os would be the job of a separate project, the jos 
distribution project.

I'm not saying everything needs to be separated out.  I definitely 
think the base kernel, the jvm, and maybe the base 
implementations of generic drivers (like the vga driver) do belong in 
the jos kernel project (and its cvs).

Agreed.

I agree.  Although, the entire discussion of a JOS source license 
was postponed to avoid distracting the core developers from getting 
the first kernel out.  Is now the time to bring this up (and probably 
slow down development while the issue is discussed)?  

I think we might as well just get it over with (no time like the 
present).  Especially now that we have a voting mechanism in 
place for major project decisions.

This information is available through the cvsweb interface:

	http://www.jos.org/cvsweb.cgi/

You will notice some modules that are unimportant. Some for testing
purposes, some which are temporary, and some which I'm sure were
accidents.

The only two you should be interested in are:

- jos (common JOS code)
- JJOS (JJOS kernel code)

The projects module currently contains nothing that is part of JOS the
operating system. The only significant project it contains is
PrettyPrinter, which is a piece of software used to maintain this
website.

I don't mind, which ever is the easiest in the long run.  I'm not sure
what has to be moved, cvs, wiki web, mailing lists.  Of these I think the
wiki web would be the hardest to move over.

Ok.  So anybody who would like to discusse a licence for the JOS Project
should subscribe to the biz@jos.org mailing list, and start work on it.

I have a feeling that it will be difficult to logically decide what's in 
and what's out.  How about the following suggestion instead: We 
start with one big project which is everything in existing JOS CVS 
and the pre-existing mailing lists.  Everyone that's willing to work 
with the core kernel developers to check in files remains in the core 
JOS project as far as SourceForge goes (I think if we keep the core 
developer list to 5-10 (which I think its at now) it should work out 
fine).  

When someone wants to work on a related project but wants their 
own CVS access, they can break away from the core project, form 
a new SourceForge project (for CVS and bug list usage), and we'll 
integrate them into the JOS project through our website and wiki 
(they point their source forge web page to the jos web page).  That 
way, the core project will stay focused, and new projects can grow 
"organically" without waiting for architectural decisions to be made.

Subject: [JOS-Admin] JOS Admin Organization...

Hello,

First a short note.  This discussion only belongs on the biz list.  So 
please, only reply to, and continue this discussion on the biz list.

I would like to bring another issue (other than the JOS License) up 
for consideration.  This is something I'd like to discuss with the 
hope that we can eventually put it up for a vote.  

It seems to me that we should decide whether to create an 
"official" minimal administrative structure to allow us to conduct 
business (this may be something we don't want to do but I think 
should be voted on one way or the other).

Establishing JOS Admin

I would like to propose and get a vote on whether JOS should be 
run like a non-profit org. business, or continue to be a non-entity as 
far as business concerns go.  My primary motivation is to 
determine, one way or the other, if we should open a JOS bank 
account.

If we remain a non-business entity, we save ourselves from the 
administration hassles, having to have a board (i.e. president and 
treasurer etc), board meetings, and we can continue operating as 
we have been.

If we become a business entity (a non-profit business organization 
I'd imagine), we can establish a bank account, and hopefully 
generate some revenue from advertising or cross-sales (like 
becoming amazon resellers) on the website.  We would also be 
able to accept donations!   The motivation being that we could pay 
for the JOS expenses member are currently incuring (if any) and 
hopefully use the remaining money for JOS.  I'd love to sponsor a 
conference or at least travel expense grants to JOS members so 
that we can have meetings (maybe at JavaOne or the O'Reilly Java 
conference).  That of course is down the line a ways but a 
possbility.

As webmaster, I've become a defacto first point of contact for much 
of the online inquiries regarding issues as wide ranging as cross-
advertising offers, requests for official training materials, 
sponsorships etc.  Most of these offers are nearly impossible to 
pursue without at least having a bank account and an official "head 
honcho".

On the other hand, there are advantages to not creating any official 
organization behind the official OS.  For instance, we remove a 
large source of possible commercial influence on the OS 
development.

The way I see it, its the difference between the Linux model (which 
has no real business behind it), and the FreeBSD model (which is 
a structured org that pays salaries etc).  IMHO, the Linux model 
works for Linux because they have a very clear leader in Linus (so 
a vision and a final "yes or no" man is present).  Do jm and _quinn 
serve this same function and are they willing to play the role?  
Does someone else?  If not, I think considering a more structured 
FreeBSD model may be beneficial to the project.

Comments?
