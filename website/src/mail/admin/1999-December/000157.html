<PRE>I have a box with pretty decent DSL; I just don't 
have time to move the Wiki to it; cauchy.clarkevans.com
You need secure crt or datafellow's product to 
connect using ssh; let me know if you need 
a password.  The cvs can also be moved over;
or mabye sourceforge should be used for this...

Ahh.  It looks like wiki.jos.org is hooked 
up to 209.9.30.67 ... hmm ... I know I told
Helmut that this is the new address; but alas,
II've moved the server to 209.9.30.66 instead.
Hmm.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've had a good look at it, it's excellent. I have released my JVM,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; They provide mailing lists, web space, FTP space, management of multiple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developers etc etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it looks really nice too.  There are many things that still 
</I>&gt;<i> need to be worked on (that's why its still a 0.x release) but there's 
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of power already in place, and many promising developments 
</I>&gt;<i> on the way.  Definitely something we should keep our eyes on.  
</I>&gt;<i> For JOS, I see two potential stumbling blocks. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, we'll need to get the wiki ported in order to move the entire 
</I>&gt;<i> site over to sourceforge.  We certainly can just host what 
</I>&gt;<i> sourceforge offers (CVS, ftp, etc) at sourceforge and keep the wiki 
</I>&gt;<i> on a separate server.  However, linking everything together with a 
</I>&gt;<i> single user id would make it worth it to port.  The main impediment 
</I>&gt;<i> to this right now is sourceforge is very new, and they haven't 
</I>&gt;<i> designed a way for us to access the session and user login 
</I>&gt;<i> information from sourceforge accounts yet.  It's on their &quot;to do&quot; list 
</I>&gt;<i> though.  I've been following the discussion and will try and stay up 
</I>&gt;<i> to date on this feature.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Second, sourceforge is designed to host a group of single product 
</I>&gt;<i> projects.  We actually should try setting up a separate sourceforge 
</I>&gt;<i> system for jos, where the projects in the JOSSourceForge are all 
</I>&gt;<i> related to JOS.  This should be possible when sourceforge 
</I>&gt;<i> releases their source (which, from the discussions on their site, 
</I>&gt;<i> should be &quot;real soon now&quot;).  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The advantages being, a nice, tight integration of JOS and its 
</I>&gt;<i> applications.  The disadvantages being we have to setup and 
</I>&gt;<i> maintain a sourceforge clone.  I like this solution best though as 
</I>&gt;<i> we can perhaps do some fund raising with such a site (advertizing 
</I>&gt;<i> or becoming amazon.com resellers) to help offset some of the 
</I>&gt;<i> costs JOS members are currently shouldering.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The alternative is porting wiki to work in sourceforge, and using 
</I>&gt;<i> sourceforge as hosted at valinux.  This way, va linux shoulders the 
</I>&gt;<i> costs and pain of setting up and maintaining the site.  We then let 
</I>&gt;<i> all the jos projects basically splinter and form their own little 
</I>&gt;<i> sourceforge projects and then do something like a web ring to link 
</I>&gt;<i> them all under the JOS &quot;umbrella&quot;.  A lot less work and will get 
</I>&gt;<i> things done sooner rather than later.  It seems like an &quot;ugly&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> solution though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are there other alternatives I'm not seeing?  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, and this is not to say sourceforge is THE solution, but we 
</I>&gt;<i> basically have to do something like a SourceForge on our own (the 
</I>&gt;<i> self hosting option) or try and use someone else's free/inexpensive 
</I>&gt;<i> service (the &quot;use SourceForge&quot; option).  There are other services 
</I>&gt;<i> like SourceForge out there... but none that I've seen so far that look 
</I>&gt;<i> as promising.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was working on my own version of a site like SourceForge for the 
</I>&gt;<i> next version of the JOS website, but now that I've seen what 
</I>&gt;<i> SourceForge does (which is almost exactly what I had in mind 
</I>&gt;<i> anyhow) I'm thinking that one way or the other, we might as well 
</I>&gt;<i> use SourceForge (either on our own site or using their service).  
</I>&gt;<i> Opinions?
