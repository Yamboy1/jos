For additional information, see also JOSDistribution1c and
JOSDistribution1d pages on JOS Wiki.

I have uploaded static HTML pages (Source-Doc) for these &quot;products&quot;:

Source Server
JJVM
Smart API - Release 1a
Smart API - Release 1b
Smart API - Release 2a

I do not have an appropriate product-level index. Each &quot;product&quot; has an
index.html file. Source code within a product is cross-linked, as when one
class uses another. HTML pages are stored in a single directory for each
product and do not require Java-like directory tree.

&gt;<i>I think its a great idea.  We definitely should try and create enough 
</I>&gt;<i>product distributions so that you don't have to download stuff you 
</I>&gt;<i>don't want.  As far as multiple versions, I would like to make 
</I>&gt;<i>historical &quot;snapshots&quot; available as jar's (as well as the latest 
</I>&gt;<i>version of each product), and only put the html pretty printed 
</I>&gt;<i>source up for the latest version of the source for each product (so 
</I>&gt;<i>as to avoid confusion).
</I>
I agree, mostly. The latest source code should be pretty printed to HTML
pages and browse-able on-line. Previous releases should be download-able
and reviewed off-line.

Should we always use jars? I use jars exclusively for .class files, so all
jars can be added to classpath. When I see a jar file, I think run-time
code. I use zips and &quot;tar balls&quot; for .java and other files.

&gt;<i>Yes.  Actually, I was planning on putting it on the www.jos.org site, 
</I>&gt;<i>but just not announcing it for a while so that the core members can 
</I>&gt;<i>hit it and comment before making a groupwise announcement.  
</I>&gt;<i>Sorta an in-house beta.  Are you planning on including the kernel 
</I>&gt;<i>sources as one of the products?
</I>
Using Source-Doc, the index for each product is automatically generated.
With additional suggestions for its design, the index.html file could
easily be replaced -- without uploading all of the pretty printed HTML pages.

The product index is currently undefined. It will be /source/index.html.
The product index should provide the following links:

Source Server 1c - srcserv1c/index.html
JJVM - jjvm/index.html
Smart API 1a = smartapi1a/index.html
Smart API 1b = smartapi1b/index.html
Smart API 2a = smartapi2a/index.html

I have been considering the &quot;short description&quot; for a product index. The
product index would be simpler if, in a three column format, it listed the
name of a product, a *link* to product description, a *link* to pretty
printed HTML pages.

Shouldn't product description really be a link to some JOS Wiki page? It
would open up the product description (and review) to any author on JOS
Wiki, not just the author of the product index. The product description
page might provide a *link* to &quot;download now&quot;.

The product index might have a single link to a DownloadJOS page.
