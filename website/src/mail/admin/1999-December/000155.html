I like jars simply because everyone with java (I hope that's a 
reasonable min requirement for JOS members) should have access 
to jar/unjar capabilities.  Since zip is jar (or more accurately jar is 
zip) I suppose we can use zip for source and jar for binaries.  

However, I think its better to come up with a naming convention 
and stick with using the .jar extension for all archives.  It _feels_ 
like a better solution.

</I>
I think both should be present.  A link to a wiki page AND an 
optional separate product discription that would go with the 
distribution.  The separate product description (if used) would hold 
&quot;canonical&quot; information that should not be changed without the 
source project itself being changed (even if only to change the 
product description).  I would imagine this type of information might 
include copyright and license notification (especially now since we 
don't have a standard JOS source license), credits, references, etc.
