Subject: [JOS-Apps] AppletBrowser application

The AppletBrowser is part of the Smart API project. Probably, it should
have been a stand-alone application. It enables you to run any applet from
a Location field. No HTML is require.

When I combine the AppletBrowser and DesktopBrowser, I can quickly show my
customers what an applet might look like on their website. The
DesktopBrowser enables me to recall the URI for a particular applet. I can
use the URI again.

The AppletBrowser is interactive. It enables us to play with applet
parameters. It enables us to reshape the applet's window to see what
happens. Once the applet works perfectly, the applet's URI is manually
translated to an HTML page. While it is possible to create an HTML page
(snippet) automatically, I never got around to it.

When running the UniversalBrowser, the AppletBrowser is a plug in. Click
the Applet button on the tool bar. Of course, the AppletBrowser is
automatically activated when you use an applet URI. An applet URI starts
with the applet: scheme. Here is the general syntax of the applet scheme:

applet:<classname>[?n1=v1[&n2=v2[...]]

Subject: [JOS-Apps] ConnectionBrowser

The ConnectionBrowser is part of the Smart API project. Likely, it should
have been a separate application.

This browser enables you to open JDBC connections.

1. It enables you to test any JDBC connection. It prints the metadata for
the connection. You can also look at tables, etc..

2. It is a great troubleshooting tool. If your JDBC application isn't
working, is it your application? Or, is it the JDBC connection? If the
ConnectionBrowser can't establish a connection either, it's probably not
your application.

The ConnectionBrowser is also a plug-in for the UniversalBrowser. Click the
Connection button on the tool bar. The ConnectionBrowser plug-in is
automatically activated whenever you use the jdbc: scheme. Type any JDBC
URL in the Location: field and press the Run button.

Subject: [JOS-Apps] ZipFinder

BasicFinder is part of the org.jos.gchii.find2a package. It is an
asynchronous I/O version of java.io.File. It searches for directories and
files on a local file subsystem.

ZipFinder is planned. It does not exist yet. For the Java 1 platform or
higher, it is possible to create a ZipFinder to search for directories and
files inside a .zip (or .jar) file. Like BasicFinder, ZipFinder must use
asynchronous I/O.

After opening a .zip file, its entire catalog is read. The catalog is
sorted in alphabetical order. The ZipFinder iterates through the catalog,
looking for files that match the given pattern. (Pattern matching has
already been written.)

As it iterates through the catalog, ZipFinder must detect changes in the
directory. The name of each directory is broadcast to a directory listener.
A directory is broadcast even when there are no matching files.

A directory name is separated from a file name using the following
conversion function:

  /**
   * Converts a file name (fn) to a directory name (dn).
   * @param fn a file name
   */
  public String fn2dn( String fn ) {
    int pos = fn.lastIndexOf( "/" ); // always slash in a .zip file
    if ( pos < 0 ) {
      return "";
    }
    return fn.substring( 0, pos );
  }

When ZipFinder finds a matching file, the name of each file is broadcast to
a file listener. When there are no more files in the catalog, ZipFinder
broadcasts this event to a FinderListener.

(a) A finder is invoked through its run() method. Like BasicFinder,
ZipFinder must implement the Finder interface in org.jos.finder1a.

(b) If there is no listener installed when a finder is run, a finder must
return immediately without broadcasting anything -- there is no listener to
broadcast to.

(c) When dealing with a zip file, the name of a directory and file always
includes the name of the original zip.

(d) Never broadcast the same directory twice. Never broadcast the same file
twice.

(e) The show option determines if a search is recursive. The starting path
for a finder is determined by the path parameter. A ZipFinder needs a
corresponding ZipFinderController for the Smart API. Here is an example of
its URI:

x-finder:zip:[file:sample.zip]/org/jos?pattern=*.*&show=all

The "archive" attribute on Windows is probably the stupidest thing I've
ever seen, as no modern backup media really has the limitations that the
"archive" attribute is there to assist for. On JOS, this attribute could
be very useful indeed... What if the filesystem knew that when a file is
attributed as archive, then it can search inside?

Something like:

in:file://localhost/hda2/docs/stored.jar/apps/name.jar

This should return a FileInputStream to the file called "name.jar"
inside the archive file "stored.jar" in the appropriate directory paths.
If "stored.jar" is a directory, then things are simple. If, however,
"stored.jar" is a file, and is recognized as an archive, then an
appropriate handler will be used to open it and extract the required
file.

Subject: [JOS-Apps] Graphical Compression Utility

Howdy Folks,

Does anyone know of any work underway (not necisarilly JOS-specific) on 
a graphical compression utility (something along the lines of MakoSoft's 
WinZip)?  Such a utility should support numerous 
comression/decompression technologies, including (Pk|Info)zip, gzip, tar 
and bzip2 (yes, I know technically speaking, tar is an archiving 
technology, and does not do (de)compression).  It would be nice, but not 
necesarry, if it also provided Corba support.

TIA,
Ian

Hi everybody,

I building a graphical application for manipulating ByteCode (assembly, 
disassembly, obfuscate, statistics, decompilation, complexity analyser) for 
hacking purpose (hacking = try to be an expert <> do illegal things).
I think this project could be useful for JOS, so I'm here.

I hope someone'll answer.

That definitely sounds like something we could use.  Do you have a 
write up on it in the Wiki yet?  If you put a wiki page up for it, then 
I'll put an announcement on the jos homepage and try and drum up 
some support!
