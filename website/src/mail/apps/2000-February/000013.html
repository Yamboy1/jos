<PRE>Can you help identify all JOS applications?

Like the man pages for Linux, we need a simple summary for each class
application. After successfully compiling the source code from the JOS, now
what? Few of the classes are documented so that I can use them. I am now in
search of more information about JOS applications.

There are two kinds of JOS applications: borrowed and built. Each class
that defines public static void main( String[] ) is-a Java application.
Loosly speaking, all of the Java applications related to the JOS Project
are JOS applications. While technically they might not require JOS,
applications we build are maintained for and by members of the JOS Project.
From the source code, it looks like there are many programs and
applications that have been written. And yet, many remain unused and
undocumented.

Borrowed:

ClassFile
Jasmin/JAS
Jext
jCVS
clUtilities (cat, cd, ls, whois, etc.)
DemoShell


Built:

Downloader
init
TestSuite?
Applet Browser
Connection Browser
Desktop Browser
PlainText Browser
Property Browser
Universal Browser
WebSource
Find
Package Compiler
Package Archiver
ERIC Project (zerich, deric, erica)

Future applications are on our wish list. We need to keep a list of
applications that need to be &quot;borrowed&quot; or built. If we identify
applications that run on JOS, we can borrow them from other open-source
projects.

For JEPS:

ping
telnet
telnetd
ftp
ftpd
bootpd
tftpd
echod
syslogd

If you know of any JOS-related class that defines main(), please reply. We
can summarize these classes in an application list. This might be a good
use of our apps mailing list.
