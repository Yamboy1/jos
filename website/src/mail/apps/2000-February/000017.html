Thank you for your direct observation. How compatible should a JOS
application be with foreign operating systems? This is a complex issue.

I like the mechanism HTML uses. No matter what platform you're on, an HTML
page always uses the forward slash to separate the parts of a URL. That's
one way to achieve platform independence.

Typically, the path comes from an ERIC shortcut. An ERIC shortcut is
binary-compatible across all Java-based platforms. You can copy an ERIC
shortcut from JOS to Linux to Windows to a Mac. The shortcut itself remains
the same. It work without modification.

On the other hand, the semi-colon is more compatible with a foreign OS that
already happens to use it. It might be easier for others to teach
themselves how to manually edit a shortcut.

I would much rather see a platform-independent tool that helps you create
an ERIC shortcut. Such a GUI tool would not require you to know about the
semi-colon. Alas, I am not a gifted GUI person. I haven't got a clue what
an ERIC shortcut editor might look like.

&gt;<i>Have you considerred using java system properties instead?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Example: java -Deric.cache=cachev -Deric.path=pathv -Deric.shell=shellv
</I>&gt;<i>-Deric.location=locationv RunEricApplication
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This would then allow these values to be accessible to any application
</I>running
&gt;<i>within the same VM.  Additionally, by creating a ~/.ericrc properties file,
</I>&gt;<i>which could be parsed at startup, a user could be able to customize the ERIC
</I>&gt;<i>suite to their own personal preferences.
</I>
From a foreign operating system, the eric tool uses a configuration file
for system-wide settings and ERIC shortcut for localize, application
specific settings. The eric tool uses JNI to create a virtual machine and
invoke RunEricApplication.

But, that's not the only way to invoke RunEricApplication. Once an
application is running it can invoke another. Parameters are passed
directly from a parent process to a child, without going through system
properties.

ERIC is leaning heavily toward a single virtual machine/multiple process
idea. ERIC doesn't use system properties for the second and third
application. With two or more applications running in a single virtual
machine with only one class loader, system properties don't allow more than
one instance of cache, path, shell and location.

Thanks,
