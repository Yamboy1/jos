<PRE>Pure Reflection for Java might be useful to build an interactive,
GUI-enabled application. A user might point and click at a package to be
reflected.

It might be useful to build an interactive, Java servlet-enabled
application. An end-user might point and click at a package to be reflected
inside of an off-the-shelf HTML browser.

A class file contains many details. Many cross-reference indices are
possible. An application might, for example, display the average size of
the constant pool structure across a suite of classes. It might provide an
analysis of classes, including a class with the most complex inheritence
and others.

While one-class-at-a-time browsing is nice, it does not measure the
complexity of a Java application as a whole. Pure reflection can quickly
answer questions about your application:

How many classes?
How many fields? instance fields? static fields?
How many constants (final fields)?
How many methods? instance methods? static methods? native methods?

With the implementation of a ZipFinder, pure reflection is capable of
reflecting classes stored in zip and jar archive.

Given a simulated CLASSPATH, pure reflection can provide the names of every
class that can be loaded.
