<PRE>The ERIC Project has been very good to me. It enables me to install my
application bytecode on a central HTTP service and run a Java application
on any machine on the 'net. While there is a place for a package cache, the
eric tool does not yet cache package files automatically.

Here is what I've been thinking. I could upgrade the deric tool to write a
package file catalog. The deric tool already creates package files. It
automatically detects when class files in a package are &quot;newer&quot; than the
package file. It only makes the package files that need to be made.

If the deric tool automatically maintained a package file catalog and the
package file catalog was distributed along with those packages, it would be
possible to automatically refresh a package file cache.

[packages]
package-name-1=serial-number-1
package-name-2=serial-number-2
package-name-3=serial-number-3

I was thinking of something compatible with the data registry from the
Smart API. Each package file is assigned a serial number by the deric tool.
The erica tool downloads the package file catalog and compares it to a
local copy of the catalog. If serial numbers are different, erica downloads
the package file from the HTTP service. The erica tool copies package files
from one path to another.

The eric tool could /always/ load package files from the local package file
cache. The erica tool could be configured for &quot;silent&quot; operation or &quot;ask
before refreshing&quot;.

This mechanism would work with jars, too. A new tool could &quot;scan&quot; a
directory and automatically detect new jars. It would maintain a jar
catalog in a file compatible with the data registry. Like erica, a
client-side tool could automatically download new jars when their serial
number has changed.

I have been working to use the network to distribute Java applications and
servlets, not just applets and agents. It is a good idea whose time has come.
