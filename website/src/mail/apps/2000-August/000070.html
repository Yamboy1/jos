<PRE>Together, the Smart API and Subprogram API provide a simple mechanism to
describe the target program in a string, a uniform resource identifier. A
string is easily passed on the command line to a java tool. A string is
easily passed from client to server, from server to server. A string is
easily stored in a log file or message queue. A string is easily stored in
a desktop or shortcut file. Additional options, such as custom class loader
and primordial class loader, can easily be supported in a uniform resource
identifier. These are good reasons to use a &quot;primative&quot; string instead of
an instance of some elaborate Java class.

The Subprogram API is found in the org.jos.program2a package. By default,
programs share a single class loader. When the same program is invoked
multiple times, desireable things happen:

- its classes are reused (loads very fast);
- its static fields are available across invocations;
- objects can be easily shared across multiple programs.

A custom class loader is an option, too. When a program is invoked with a
new class loader, desireable things happen:

- its classes are loaded again (they may have changed)
- its static fields are reset with each invocation;
- objects can be shared across multiple programs.

With an MPCL-compatible virtual machine, a new primordial class loader is
an option. When a program is invoked this way, desirable things happen:

- establish custom java.class.path (CLASSPATH);
- &quot;system&quot; classes are loaded again (they may have changed);
- static fields of system classes are reset;
- its classes are loaded again;
- its static fields are reset;
- objects must be shared through normal IPC.

A bytecode process is an option, too. When a program is invoked this way,
desirable things happen:

- creates a new process ID;
- logon with another user account;
- all files are closed automatically at exit;
- establish custom java.class.path (CLASSPATH);
- system classes are loaded again;
- static fields of system classes are reset;
- its classes are loaded again;
- its static fields are reset;
- objects must be shared through normal IPC.
