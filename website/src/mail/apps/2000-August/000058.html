<PRE>BootDisk is not a UNIX(r)-specific program. BootDisk is written in pure
bytecode so that it can be as platform-independent as it can.

&gt;<i>I agree.  I would be more reluctant to label BootDisk &quot;pure java&quot;

</I>&gt;<i>realm.  If you use the term &quot;pure java&quot; I think most readers would expect

</I>
In the fine print, &quot;100% Pure Java&quot; includes applications with machine
code, called through Java Native Interface and java.lang.Runtime. All &quot;100%
Pure Java&quot; applications must be certified as such by Sun Microsystems. None
of my products are certified as &quot;100% Pure Java&quot;. I have no intention of
working toward such certification.

The certification mark is defined, specified and documented by Sun
Microsystems. I believe their definition is misleading and has little
value. A &quot;100% Pure Java&quot; application is certified on only the most popular
operating systems. An application either works on an operating system or it
doesn't. No one can certify that an application works on all operating
systems, past, present and future. No one can certify that an application
works on all virtual machines, past, present and future. Sun's definition
changes when they release a new JDK. Applications once certified are no
longer compliant.

Instead of &quot;100% Pure Java&quot;, I like to use &quot;pure bytecode&quot;. I neither
assume you're running the latest Java Virtual Machine nor assume that
you're using the Java programming language.

Instead of &quot;100% Pure Java&quot;, I like to use open-source and free-license
approach. If BootDisk doesn't work on your operating system, you have an
opportunity to re-compile it from modified source so that it does.

&gt;<i>This is a very reasonable and good thing to do.
</I>
As soon as JJOS has a way to write a boot disk image, BootDisk should be
ported to JJOS. I try to focus on one operating system at a time. Even Java
applications must be ported to work on multiple operating systems.

If someone has more information on creating a boot disk with other
operating systems, like Mac OS, this application could run on more than
Linux and Windows.

If someone has more information on other boot disk options, they could be
added to the drop-down list.

With the HTTP path option, the Boot Disk application can be installed on a
website, always giving its users access to the latest boot disk images
without upgrading. (Java Web Start is not required.)
