You're right. The FileOutputStream class works just like cat.

&gt;<i>What happens if you do &quot;cmp /dev/fd0 stage1&quot;...?
</I>
When I compared stage1 with /dev/fd0, they were not even close. There was a
bug in loadStage1() that gave me a zero-filled array instead of the
contents of the stage1 file. A similar bug was inside loadStage2().

The key to solving this puzzle was the cmp command. That command made it
was obvious that BulkMake wasn't writing what I thought it was. Then, I ran
this:

cat /dev/fd0 | more

The first bytes on floppy were blank. I searched backward through the code
until I found this:

byte[] payload = new byte[ stage1.length ];
System.arraycopy( payload, 0, stage1, 0, stage1.length );

which mistakenly copies bytes the wrong direction. I changed it to

System.arraycopy( stage1, 0, payload, 0, stage1.length );

and it works!
