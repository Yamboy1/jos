<PRE>BootDisk is not a UNIX(r)-specific program. BootDisk is written in pure
bytecode so that it can be as platform-independent as it can. But
platform-independence can only be taken so far. BootDisk does not require
that every step in the process be written in bytecode. Anyone can create a
boot disk manually, with well-written documentation.

I have two goals:

1. Fully automate BootDisk on Linux.
2. Fully automate BootDisk on Windows.

I have been leaning toward a more platform-independent model for BootDisk.
It is partially documented on JOS Wiki. BootDisk can separate out the
platform-independent part:

1. selecting a boot method

The drop-down box of boot method is the same, no matter which operating
system you use to create a boot disk. The list of boot methods is expected
to grow.

2. writing a boot image

If the platform-independent part /always/ writes a boot image to a
well-known file, regardless of platform, it can invoke a platform-dependent
part to write the file to the floppy.

Here is where the platform-dependent part starts. Once a well-known file
contains a boot image, each platform needs a way to write the image to a
floppy. A pure Java program can detect the operating system, using the
os.name system property and invoke an appropriate command.

What if the well-known boot image is called &quot;bootdisk.dat&quot;? Each platform
would implement a way to copy &quot;bootdisk.dat&quot; to a floppy disk.

On Linux, the dd or cat command should work. The BootDisk application might
invoke this external command:

cat bootdisk.dat &gt; /dev/fd0

On Windows, the rawrite command should work. The BootDisk application might
invoke this external command:

rawrite bootdisk.dat A:

On other platforms, other commands might be needed. I'm sure the Mac has a
program that can copy a boot image to a floppy. That will have to be
determined by the Mac's user.
