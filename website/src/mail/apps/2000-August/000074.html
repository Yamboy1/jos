<PRE>Based on the design of TextSearch, it should be possible to compare text
files in any two directory trees. The basic process might look something
like this:

1. Open file &quot;A&quot; and file &quot;B&quot;.

If file &quot;A&quot; or file &quot;B&quot; is missing, files are different. Print a message
and exit.

2. Read one line from file &quot;A&quot; and one line from file &quot;B&quot;.

IF both A.line and B.line are null, the files have identical content. Print
a message and exit.

IF A.line is null, the files are different because file &quot;A&quot; has fewer lines
than &quot;B&quot;. Print a message and exit.

IF B.line is null, the files are different because file &quot;B&quot; has fewer lines
than &quot;A&quot;. Print a message and exit.

IF A.line is not equal to B.line, the files are different. Print a message
and exit.

Otherwise, continue with step 2.

The compare program would search for files with the same name in a
different directory. The location of a compare program could be something
like this:

run:program:org.jos.gchii.textcompare1a.TextCompareProgram
    ?directory1=somedirectory
    &amp;directory2=someotherdirectory
    &amp;pattern=*.txt
    &amp;show=all

The TextCompare utility could have the following fields

Directory 1:
Directory 2:
Pattern:
Show:

When a file is in directory 1 but not directory 2, a message is printed.
But what about the other way around? A file in directory 2 that is not in
directory 1 would be ignored.

A directory comparison utility that looks at names, not content would also
be useful in the Source Server clean-up project.
