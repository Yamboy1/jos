<PRE>It might be possible to implement an experimental device: scheme that works
on the Linux operating system, since devices are available through its file
subsystem. The x-device: scheme is something like the following:

public interface Device {
  public abstract InputStream getInputStream()
      throws IOException;
  public abstract OutputStream getOuputStream()
      throws IOException;
}

The x-device: scheme always returns an instance of Device (or null). Here
is an location that would return a floppy disk device:

x-device:floppydisk:?drive=0

Here is an example location that would return a hard disk device:

x-device:harddisk:?drive=0&amp;partition=0

Unlike an earlier discussion, limited resources are not controlled by the
operating system. Creating an instance of Device does not lock the device
for the exclusive use of a process. Rather, the locking is left up to the
implementation of a particular device. Typically, the getInputStream() and
getOutputStream() methods handle locking implicitly. If a device is
&quot;in-use&quot;, these methods throw an IOException.

For Linux, this scheme can be supported by creating a generic
implementation of Device, something like this:

public class GenericDevice
    implements Device {
  public GenericDevice( String v ) {
    name = v;
  }
  public InputStream getInputStream() {
    return new FileInputStream( name );
  }
  public OutputStream getOutputStream() {
    return new FileOutputStream( name );
  }
  private String name;
}

-----

For compatibility, it is possible to implement a parallel subscheme, where
both subschemes work at the same time. Here is a location that returns a
floppy disk device:

x-device:fd0

This location would be translated into x-device:floppydisk:?drive=0

Here is a location that returns a hard disk device:

x-device:hda0

This location would be translated into x-device:harddisk:?drive=0&amp;partition=0

-----

An operating system does not have to make devices available through its
file subsystem. In fact, a file subsystem could be written on top of the
x-device: scheme. For these operating systems, such as JOS, an application
could be written in a more platform-independent way:

  public void example() {
    URI uri = new URI( &quot;x-device:floppydrive:?drive=0&quot; );
    Device d = (Device) uri.getObject();
    if ( d == null ) {
      // device is not yet supported
      return;
    }

    InputStream input;
    try {
      input = d.getInputStream();
    }
    catch ( IOException e ) {
      // device is being used by another process
    }

    OutputStream output;
    try {
      output = d.getOutputStream();
    }
    catch ( IOException e ) {
      // device is being used by another process
    }
  }

A suitable implementation of Device must be created for other operating
systems and other devices. This might involve custom classes on JOS or
might involve machine code on Windows. Even a network interface card could
be read from and written to by streams.
