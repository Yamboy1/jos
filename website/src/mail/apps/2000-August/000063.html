<PRE>It gives me great satisfaction when a release is complete and can be made
available to others. An  announcement seems to be the last step in the
cycle. By an announcement, others can find out about the release as soon as
it is available. By posting a link to a JOS Wiki article or other URL,
anyone interested in a release can find out more.

Is it appropriate to post announcements on this list? Or rather, would it
be more appropriate to announce applications on a general &quot;announce&quot;
mailing list?

-----

At the other end of the spectrum, I have a long list of applications that I
would like to use. Sometimes it gets frustrating when I need an application
and can't find it. Others might suggest an application when I describe the
kind of application I need. By posting a request for an application, anyone
that has seen a similar problem might suggest an application that works for
them.

Is it appropriate to post a request for application on this list? Or
rather, should this also be posted to a general &quot;announce&quot; mailing list?
