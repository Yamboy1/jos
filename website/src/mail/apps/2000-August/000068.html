I'd keep the announcements here for now (and in the wiki of course).

Yes.  I want to create a java software directory (like a yahoo directory 
but for java software) as part of the new jos website.  Gamelan was 
supposed to be this I guess but it seems to be mostly out of date.

&gt;<i>Is it appropriate to post a request for application on this list? Or
</I>&gt;<i>rather, should this also be posted to a general &quot;announce&quot; mailing list?
</I>
You should ask it here if its an application request.  And in general 
otherwise.
