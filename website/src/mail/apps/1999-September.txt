Subject: [JOS-Apps] Canonical method to submit bug reports/feature requests

Morning Everyone,

I recently downloaded Jext (by Romain Guy) from the AppsDownload page.
While I am generally pleased with the application, there are areas where
improvements could be made.  I have no problem with implementing the
changes, but do not want to duplicate anybody else's efforts.

So, I am wondering, what is the "proper" method of submitting bug
reports/feature requests, and/or announcing intentions to contribute to
an on-going project?


TIA,
Ian

DigiGod,

Have you taken a look at the gnu.getopt package
(http://www.urbanophile.com/arenn/hacking/download.html) ?

Subject: [JOS-Apps] Free Java libraries - announcement and question

Hi, everybody!

First, let me introduce me and my project.

I am on the JOS mailing list from two months and there were only few
messages during this time. So I consider this isn't yet the time of
explosion of applications for JOS :) I am coding in java for several
months now and found it my best programming experience ever. I am
writing 'Fictor' -a 3D modeler in Java. I am using OpenGL for displaying
graphics with GL4Java binding.

Now question:
 - Does anyone knows about free (I mean GPLed) Java library with classes
useable in real-life programing? I mean no fancy clocks and twisting
text and logos but things like data structures, GUI widgets, various
formats (eg. raster/vector graphic) readers/writers...

...announcement:
- I am collecting various easily reuseable Java classes in one
consistent library called MAGE. Each class is GPL, tested, stored into
reasonable package, documented and comes with examples.
My biggest addition to this library is a BMP ImageProducer. More will
come later (TIFF/PCX/TGA/LBM/RAW...)
During creation of my application I found this method of gathering
reusable elements the best, I've alse added some other classes. Creation
of this library just begun but I would like anyone to contribute and use
this in your own projects.

and invitation:
- if anyone would like to join me in process of creating Fictor, you're
welcomed (3D graphic knowledge is not required :) - there is a lot of
work to do on custom GUI, format readers/writers, math programing...)

Cheers,
Max

GNU has a page on their site (http://www.gnu.org/software/java/java.html)
dedicated to GNU and Java.  Also, issue 6 of Brave GNU World, GNU's
newsletter (sorry, don't have the URL handy, but there is a link to the
Brave GNU World archives off the main page ) had several articles on GNU and
Java, and various GPLed Java projects, including a couple working on
developing a clean-room, GPLed JVM (http://www.kaffe.org/) and
implementations of the core classes (http://www.japhar.org/ ,
http://www.classpath.org/ ).  I'll let you read the articles, as they cover
this topic far more throughly than I could.


HTH,
Ian

    I am the author of Jext, an application listed in the JOS app part. Jext
isn't a part of JOS yet since it hasn't the right package name. Because this
is a big app which I'm distributing by other ways, I will wait a final
release (bugless, no more functions to add...) to release a JOS version.
Thought, you can send me bug reports, suggestions or anything else.

    See ya !

P.S: hope you'll like it
P.P.S: current version is 2.4.8
