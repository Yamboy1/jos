<PRE>For me, the most exciting thing about Java technologies has been starting
Java applications from a CD-ROM and from across the network. The eric tool
enables me to do that on Windows. I haven't used the java tool in a long
time. I have been using either José or ERIC for the last two years. It
doesn't take me long to package a new Java application into an .exe.

I'm working on a new HTML page for the ERIC Project website at

<A HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~gchii/eric/">http://www.mindspring.com/~gchii/eric/</A>

Many Java programmers want to distribute their Java application as a
Windows executable. That's not asking too much is it? And a Java programmer
should not be required to learn C/C++ and Java Native Interface (JNI) just
for this. There is a better way. The most difficult part can be done once.

First, the eric tool is designed to be reusable. For example, websource.exe
is a verbatim copy of eric.exe. There is no separate source code for
websource.exe. Java programmers are not required to learn C/C++ or JNI.

Second, the eric tool always reads its configuration from a file with the
same name. As eric.exe, it reads configuration from eric.ini. As
websource.exe, it reads websource.ini. As minisrv.exe, it reads minisrv.ini.

Let's say you want to run a Java application called &quot;myApp&quot;. Use the
following steps:

1. copy eric.exe to myApp.exe.
2. copy eric.ini to myApp.ini.
3. edit myApp.ini with a text editor
4. change the shell property to &quot;myApp&quot; and save myApp.ini.

-----

Inside the configuration file, there are four properties.

path - This is a list of directories or websites where the program can
download package files.

shell - This is the name of any Java class that implements
org.jos.gchii.eric1c.Shell.

location - This property is optional. This is the name of a location or
command that is passed to a shell.

javahome - This property is optional. On many machines, the eric tool finds
a JDK/JRE automatically. To select a specific JDK/JRE, use this property.
