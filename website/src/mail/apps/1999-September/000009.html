<PRE>Hi, everybody!

First, let me introduce me and my project.

I am on the JOS mailing list from two months and there were only few
messages during this time. So I consider this isn't yet the time of
explosion of applications for JOS :) I am coding in java for several
months now and found it my best programming experience ever. I am
writing 'Fictor' -a 3D modeler in Java. I am using OpenGL for displaying
graphics with GL4Java binding.

Now question:
 - Does anyone knows about free (I mean GPLed) Java library with classes
useable in real-life programing? I mean no fancy clocks and twisting
text and logos but things like data structures, GUI widgets, various
formats (eg. raster/vector graphic) readers/writers...

...announcement:
- I am collecting various easily reuseable Java classes in one
consistent library called MAGE. Each class is GPL, tested, stored into
reasonable package, documented and comes with examples.
My biggest addition to this library is a BMP ImageProducer. More will
come later (TIFF/PCX/TGA/LBM/RAW...)
During creation of my application I found this method of gathering
reusable elements the best, I've alse added some other classes. Creation
of this library just begun but I would like anyone to contribute and use
this in your own projects.

and invitation:
- if anyone would like to join me in process of creating Fictor, you're
welcomed (3D graphic knowledge is not required :) - there is a lot of
work to do on custom GUI, format readers/writers, math programing...)

Cheers,
Max
