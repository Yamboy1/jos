Subject: [JOS-Apps] Application

public static void main(String args[]);

I dont like typing that. I made a little workaround thats fully
compatiable with Java that makes it a tad easier to write apps quickly,
it has its drawbacks but Id say 90% of the time its easier. let the code
speack for its self:

/////////////
package digigod.apps;

import java.io.*;

public abstract class Application {
 private          String         arguments[];
 private          BufferedReader reader      = null;
 private          boolean        debug       = false;
 protected static Application    app         = null;

 public static void main(String args[]) {
  if(app==null)
   System.exit(255);
  app.parseArgs(args);
  app.appMain();
 }

 public int getArgsLength() {
  return arguments.length;
 }

 public String getArg(int idx) {
  return arguments[idx];
 }

 public String[] getArgs() {
  return arguments;
 }
 
 public void exit() {
  exit(0);
 }

 public void exit(int code) {
  System.exit(code);
 }

 public boolean isDebug() {
  return debug;
 }

 public void enableDebug(boolean b) {
  debug = b;
 }

 public void print(String str) {
  System.out.print(str);
 }

 public void println(String str) {
  System.out.println(str);
 }

 public void printerr(String str) {
  System.err.println(str);
 }

 public String readln() throws IOException {
  if(reader==null)
   reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
  return reader.readLine();
 }

 public void debug(String str) {
  if(debug)
   System.out.println(str);
 }

 // only these methods below should be altered by a child, and only the
first required to be
 
 public abstract void appMain();

 public void parseArgs(String args[]) { //can be overridden to add extra
parsing functionality
  arguments = args;
 }
 
 public String getApplicationInfo() {
  return "";
 } 
}
/////////////

ok, lets look at what we got here. the standard main function checks to
see if there is an instance of app, if not it exits; this means
subclasses (like the example below) need to create an instance of
themselves in a static intilizer block. Subclasses, obviosly, also need
to create the method public void appMain() (I couldnt think of anything
better) this is where your code goes, notice that parsing is handled in
parseArgs(String args[]) this lets you seperate that drudgery from your
main method, if you want it could set class variables then in your main
method if they were null to set them to the default (you should also
notice there is nothing preventing one from parsing in the appMain
method if one would like-to/need-to). other then all the required
methods there are a handful of helper methods, these are just meant to
make things easier and can be ignored. getApplicationInfo() is just like
getAppletInfo() and can be ignored as well.

here is an example: (which I didnt bother testing btw (it /looks/ like
it'll work))

/////////////
public class TestApp extends Application {
 static {
  app = new TestApp();
 }

 public void appMain() {
  print("hello cruel world");
  try {
   Thread.currentThread().wait(30000);
  } catch(Exception e) {
   if(isDebug())
    e.printStackTrace();
  }
  print("goodbye cruel world");
  exit();
 }

}
/////////////

Check this out:

/////////////
package digigod.apps;

public abstract class JOSApplication extends Application {
 public static void main(String args[]) {
  if(System.getProperty("os.name").equals("JOS"))
   System.out.println("Requires JOS (www.jos.org)");
  if(app==null)
   System.exit(255);
  app.parseArgs(args);
  app.appMain();
 }

 //add methods for easy access to JOS specific things like registry
access

 public abstract void appMain();
}
/////////////

its the same as Application but it'll quit if its not run on JOS (this
should only be used if something really requires to be on JOS, otherwise
Application should be used) when we have more JOS stuff easy access
methods could easily be added to make it easier to interface with JOS,
like:

public void loadRegistry(String loc) throws IOException
publiv String getProccessName()

et al.

---

This is 100% compatiable with the standard Java way, it does mean the
main class cant subclass anything but Application, but since subclassing
Application isnt required it doesnt really matter, its only meant to
make things easy. Also Ive always thought it bad form to put your main
in a subclass of [J]Frame, but maybe thats just me....

Cheers,
