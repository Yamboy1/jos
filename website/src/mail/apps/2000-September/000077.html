<PRE>Release 11 of the Smart API 2a is coming soon. It includes a bug fix to the
Universal Browser, which once again enables it to launch a copy of itself.
It includes a new utility for comparing two text files, called TextCompare.

Universal Browser depends on the Smart API. The Universal Browser
demonstrates the power of the Smart API. It is an example program. Many
other programs in this collection are example programs. It seems to me that
Smart API and Universal Browser should have been distributed separately.

The distribution may change, but not the names of any package. The process
of splitting off the Universal Browser part of the Smart API is a good
thing. It would enable me to provide more documentation of these example
programs.

It leads directly to the possibility of a fully self-contained product
called Universal Browser for Windows(tm), and another called Universal
Browser for Linux(r).

In the beginning, every change to Smart API had a corresponding change to
the Universal Browser. It made sense to distribute them together. Now, the
Smart API 2a distribution might be too big.
