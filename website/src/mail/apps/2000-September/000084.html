<PRE>Release 1 of Pure Reflection 1c is available for immediate download. It was
written in C++ on Windows and needs to be tested (ported?) to Linux.

SOURCE: This archive includes only the C++ source code:

<A HREF="http://www.jos.org/redist/mirror/jos1g/jos1g-purereflection1c-1.zip">http://www.jos.org/redist/mirror/jos1g/jos1g-purereflection1c-1.zip</A>

Pure reflection is part of the VMKit. Pure reflection decodes a class file.
It works inside and outside of a virtual machine. One pure reflection
component works with Java 0, 1 and 2 platforms since they all share the
same &quot;classfile&quot; format. All virtual machines written in i86 machine code
need some sort of component to decode a class file, such as pure
reflection. For more information, see also the PureReflection article on
JOS Wiki.

This is pretty close to an anchor-based model that I've been working on for
the past year and a half. This is the first version capable of reflection
down to the Code attribute. The CodeAttributeTool is able to return
MaxStack and MaxLocals, code, handlers and attributes.

This distribution also includes the new IntArray and ByteArray classes,
(although they aren't yet used).

This archive contains a pre-compiled copy of classdata.exe. This program
reflects the java.lang, java.util, java.io and java.net packages of Kore.
If you'll notice, it requires no external resources. It does not read
classes from a directory or an archive.

With a little work, this program could recognize command line options. I'm
thinking a command like this might reflect a single class:

classdata java/lang/Object

and a command like this might reflect a package:

classdata java/lang/*

With a little work, classdata.exe could easily generate HTML pages.

-----

KORE: This archive includes classes from Kore 0.0.7 already converted to C++:

<A HREF="http://www.jos.org/redist/mirror/jos1g/jos1g-purereflection1c-1-kore.zip">http://www.jos.org/redist/mirror/jos1g/jos1g-purereflection1c-1-kore.zip</A>

A simple Java application converts .class files to bytecode resource (.cpp)
files. The generated code in this archive is only one of many possible ways
to do this.

-----

I'm planning to write a new JOSWiki article called DownloadPureReflection.
Look for it.
