<PRE>Pure Reflection is available for Java and C++. Both decode .class files.
Pure Reflection for Java has been updated to catch up to Pure Reflection
for C++.

All get..CP() methods return a constant pool (CP) index. All get..Spec()
methods return a slash delimited name, like java/lang/Object. All
get..Name() methods return a dot delimited name, like java.lang.Object.

The importance of pure reflection cannot be overemphasized. Pure reflection
is where most designers start when building their own virtual machine. When
many classes are involved, pure reflection is safer and faster than
practical reflection. It is safer because no methods of the reflected class
are invoked. It is faster because classes are only decoded, not defined; no
class loader is involved.

Pure reflection is cross-Java-platform, too. A Java 0 virtual machine, for
example, can reflect classes from Java 2.

I have written too many Java servlets to remember them all. Just the other
day, I needed to know the name of every servlet I had written. It was the
perfect opportunity to use Pure Reflection for Java.

With that assignment nearly completed, I have also created a generic
utility for searching for classes based on inheritence. I have called it
the &quot;Instance Of&quot; utility. It will be available in a new release of Smart
API 2a.

run:program:org.jos.gchii.instanceof1a.InstanceOf

The Instance Of utility works like this. Type the name of a directory (used
like CODEBASE) where your .class files are stored. Optionally, type the
name of a package where you want the search to start. Type the name of the
interface or class to match. Click on the Run button to start the search.
The name of every matching class is displayed.

The following example will search for all classes which directly or
indirectly implment the java.lang.Runnable interface.

Directory: J:\
Package: org.jos
Interface: java.lang.Runnable

This utility looks recursively through each superclass and each interface,
until it finds a matching class name or &quot;java.lang.Object&quot;.

This utility is implemented in AWT for maximum compatibility. Any method
can invoke the InstanceOfProgram with directory, package and interface
parameters.
