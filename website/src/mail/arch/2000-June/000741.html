<PRE>&gt;<i> My personal view on the kernel however is different, especially since I
</I>&gt;<i> have little knowledge of low-level programming and kernel programming. In
</I>&gt;<i> my opinion I would prefer to host the JVM on an established microkernel, I
</I>&gt;<i> know of a few that are options:
</I>
	I, personally, don't have any objections to hosting on another
kernel, though I won't port decaf (to whatever extent is required) away
from JJOS unless/until I need to do something that JJOS does not
provide.  Since JM has been inactive in development for quite some time
now, it grows more and more likely that I will hit a wall sooner than
later.  We'll probably see it in writing support for a class library; I
may have to end up adopting a kernel that does dynamic linking and
multiple native processes.  (Sigh.)

&gt;<i> I hope I don't sound patronising in the above, I think you're doing a
</I>&gt;<i> great job. (I do sometimes get a bit frustrated with the speed of
</I>&gt;<i> development though -- but I also understand the enormity of the task ... )
</I>
	I also get frustrated with the speed of development, but there's a
hard limit on how much coding a single mind can handle in a single day,
and I'm sure you can guess what my job is...
