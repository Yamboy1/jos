<PRE>It might be the last thing people think of when building a new system. And
yet, it is critical to building confidence in a system. It is a test program.

Typically, a test program is part of a test suiste. A test program is
designed to verify or stress a system. A test suite for the Java standard
class libraries would be designed to verify all functions in the extensive
framework and stress a virtual machine.

How do I run a test program?

There are two kinds of tests. One kind of test is expected to fail. It
pushes the virtual machine until it crashes. This kind of test should be
written as a classic Java application.

Another kind of test is expected to succeed. This test is run repeatedly
until it succeeds. A virtual machine is reworked until the test succeeds.
It is a very useful to write these tests as subprograms. A complete
regression test can be performed on one instance of a virtual machine. This
begins to duplicate the real-world environment where a virtual machine is
expected to run large monolithic applications.

In extreme programming, a test class is just as important as production
classes. It is treated with respect. In Java, each test suite should be put
in a unique package. No test class should use the default package. A test
suite should use a subprogram API to run each independent test in a suite.

Every class in the Java standard class library should have one or more
corresponding test classes. That represents a lifetime of work. Who has
time to do that and write &quot;real&quot; applications too?

On the other hand, when a virtual machine already runs your favorite
application successfully, the test suite suddenly becomes irrelevant. A
test suite is a stepping stone to getting your application to work. By
extending the TestProgram class, it is easy to throw together a useful test
program that plugs into a test suite. The output from a test suite should
be HTML-compatible, so test results can be made available on-line.
