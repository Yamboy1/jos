Yes.

I agree.  Especially with a goal of minimal native code, you really only
need a very small subset of even C functionality.  So if you choose the
subset carefully, writing a C-&gt;assembly-&gt;exe. code tool chain in java
should be relatively simple... which means self-hosting JOS development
would be more practical.

&gt;<i> Currently I'm writing little &quot;routines&quot; and &quot;fragments&quot; of assembly as I
</I>&gt;<i> implement my JIT. Sometimes however I need to call back into native C
</I>&gt;<i> code to access some structures and stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope to replace this by allowing the assembler to &quot;understand&quot; a C
</I>&gt;<i> structure and access it's members in a macro-like fashion.

</I>
Yes.  I have been reading the &quot;developing your own 32-bit os&quot; book by
burgess and he developed his own simple assembler and C compiler.  The
nice  thing in his design is because he controlled the c subset, he was
able to make a nice c -&gt; assembly compiler.  Then an all purpose
assembler/linker takes care of all machine code production.  it seemed to
be a much easier design to implement, and seemed much more &quot;hackable&quot; for
getting kernel stuff done.  Beyond kernel writing, you should be using
java so even the C capabilties is really more like producing a assembly
macro compiler on steroids rather than a full on C implementation...
