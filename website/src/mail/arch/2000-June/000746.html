<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Currently I'm writing little &quot;routines&quot; and &quot;fragments&quot; of assembly as I

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I hope to replace this by allowing the assembler to &quot;understand&quot; a C

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If there was object inheritance and stuff happening there it would make

</I>
&gt;<i> Yip, ideally I also want the JIT to &quot;inline&quot; methods which access

&gt;<i> directly. So for example a dummy routine to write to an I/O port gets

</I>
Sounds interesting.

Currently I'm doing some research for my own VM I have in mind. This will
be a JAVA VM and OS written completely in JAVA where only the boot process
will be coded in ASM.
Much of this is inspired by the following article:

<A HREF="http://www-4.ibm.com/software/developer/library/jalapeno/index.html">http://www-4.ibm.com/software/developer/library/jalapeno/index.html</A>

Here are some thoughts:

There will be 2 VM's: VM1 and VM2
VM1 is a JAVA bytecode to machinecode compiler, written in JAVA. It will
compile ITSELF to a binary (elf?). It will be a fairly generic VM written
for an unoptimized processor, eg. i386.

When the machine boots, the bootloader (ASM) will load VM1, which is
compiled for i386 code. The only job VM1 has to do is compile VM2. VM2 is
actualy the same as VM1, but with a few exceptions.
VM1 will test what processor the machine is on, eg i586/MMX. VM1 will now
compile VM2 for this processor, taking into account the extra opcodes for
the i586 and MMX.
After that, VM1 will give control to VM2 and load itself out of memory.

VM2 (the optimized one) will now compile the java class libraries
(java.lang, etc.) and load all the OS-related stuff (memory management, IO
routines, disk/network drivers, etc). All of these are written in JAVA.

The VMs will compile the bytecode directly to machinecode.
There are ofcourse situations where direct control over machinecode is
preferred. Eg. device-drivers will almost certainly want that. For this I
have the following in mind:

1.) Native methods will be written in JAVA where possible.
2.) There will be a JNI-like system (like BCNI)
3.) When access to machinecode is neccessary, a method could be placed in a
seperate namespace:

package asm.i386;

class File extends I386_Assembly
{
   /*
    * Code to execute a call to byte[] java.io.File.readBytes( int n )
    */
   public static void readBytes()
   {
      asm.write( MOV, BX, SP );       // get the File object
      asm.write( DEC, SP );
      asm.write( MOV, AX, SP );       // get parameter n
      asm.write( DEC, SP );

      asm.write(......)               // do the IO-things

      asm.write( MOV, SP, AX );       // return the byte array
      asm.write( RET );
   }
}

Note: this 'assembly' is just for clarification, now it's totaly bogus
since I'm fairly new to assembler.... :)

These ASM methods are actualy never really executed. They will be executed
once when class java.io.File is being resolved, and the asm.writes will be
used directly as machinecode.

It will be needless to say that these ASM methods must be kept to a minimum
for portability reasons.

Maybe there are some people who like to brainstorm with me about this
idea...


Menno.
