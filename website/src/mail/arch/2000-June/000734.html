<PRE>&gt;<i> I believe the JOS Project is a research project. It is a research
</I>&gt;<i> project, isn't it?
</I>
	The last time /I/ checked TheGoal, it was &quot;To create, distribute,
and support a free and open operating system implementing the
Java(tm) Platform.&quot;  While creation, distribution, and support all may
involve research, the operating system is our goal.

&gt;<i> I believe there is more to JOS than just jJOS/decaf.
</I>
	And there is, and we've discussed more than just
jJOS/decaf.  jJOS/decaf is certainly the largest codebase in the JOS
project, and arguably the most important.  It should come as no suprise
that it is, then, the most discussed codebase on the kernel mailing
list.  Naturally, the kernel and the JVM are important parts of the
architecture, so I contribute to this list regularly as well, especially
concentrating on the issues of implementation -- further referencing the
jJOS/decaf codebase.

	I do not object to others coding other parts of JOS before the
kernel and JVM are done; there is plenty of work that needs to be done
that can or should be implemented as a classic Java application.  
Depending on where you draw the line between operating system and
distribution, it's certainly possible that only 20% of the JOS/OS** code
needs multiple processes, et al, from a custom kernel and JVM.  It is
furthermore possible that it would be faster to to fork Kaffe or
ElectricalFire, etc, but that it is not something I'm interested in.

	If someone were to begin customizing another JVM, it is possible
that they could both argue me out of my position that a ground-up custom
JVM is a better solution and convince me to work on the port.  Until then,
I will continue to work on decaf.

&gt;<i> Why do others get the mistaken impression that the JOS Project has a
</I>&gt;<i> very narrow focus on building a Java Virtual Machine?
</I>
	Perhaps because we haven't developed anything else of general
interest yet.  The raison-d'etre of a next-generation operating system
(enviroment*) is to enable next-generation applications.  We don't have
any next-generation applications yet, AFAIK.

	I am not opposed to generating distributions of Java applications;
it's something we need to do anyway.  I just don't think it will attract
very much attention; what is, after all, the point of redoing something
you've already got, but slower?  Without something to enable
next-generation applications, I will not spend my time following any of
your suggestions.

	In general, what is an operating system?  It is a mean to ends;
for JOS, to enable next-generation applications by the leveraging the
power and flexibility of the Java Platform.  It has been shown to my
satisfication that JOS will require processes to achieve its goals.  It
has not been shown to my satisfaction that anything other than extending
the Java Virtual Machine will enable processes.  I intend to extend the
JVM in decaf; you are invited to convince me of a better course of action
-- I prefer not work in error.
