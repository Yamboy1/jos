I would agree with both approaches.  I think the OS will be 
experimental for a while to come, but the ultimate purpose the 
research is devoted to is to create a working usable os.

Well, there is much beyond a JVM to create a fully usable OS.  
Although I do believe that much of that research and development 
can be accomplished on any JVM currently available (say the jdk 
on windows or linux) and doesn't require one on a stripped down os.

&gt;<i> My personal view on the kernel however is different, especially since I

</I>
This has been suggested numerous times and the RTEMS people 
are very interested in someone doing such a port.  Just hasn't 
happened yet.  I think getting the RTEMS basic kernel built and 
running on a system has been too big a task an has discouraged 
this approach.

&gt;<i> GNU Mach
</I>&gt;<i> rtmk
</I>&gt;<i> some kind of OSKit build
</I>
All are very interesting options.

&gt;<i> My latest work with my JVM has been a JIT (written in Java) that uses an
</I>&gt;<i> IA32 assembler (also written in Java). It's not an &quot;everything gets

</I>
That would be wonderful.

&gt;<i> This also raises the issue of eventually having JOS self-hosting,

</I>
I agree with this.  Assemblers are relatively easy to write.  My 
current very small campaign has been to have the native code 
written in C because its a much simpler language to write 
compilers for (if and when that task ever comes up).
