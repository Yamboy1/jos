I am trying to make sense of your latest definition JOSCore. Are you saying
that JOSCore is written in machine code? JOSCore would be written in
machine code if it is first and comes before a kernel and virtual machine.

Why does JOSCore come before the kernel?

Are you saying that we can write a platform-independent kernel on top of a
platform-dependent JOSCore?

Are JOSExtensions written in machine code too?

We have defined a kernel and its kernel modules. Both a kernel and its
kernel modules are compiled to machine code and, at runtime, are
platform-dependent. A JOS-compatible kernel would be able to load
JOS-compatible kernel modules. Loading a JOS-compatible kernel modules must
include fix-up, or binding a kernel module to the kernel.

At least, we can agree that JOSCore is neither jos.core nor org.jos.core.

We have defined a kernel interface. RJK has consistently called the layer
between a portable kernel and non-portable kernel as a kernel interface. A
portable kernel is made platform-specific at compile-time. A JOS-compatible
kernel might load JOS-compatible kernel modules, all written in machine code.

When a virtual machine is a JOS-compatible kernel module, any
JOS-compatible kernel can load it, bind it and run it. A virtual machine
becomes a plug-in to the kernel.

I believe we have run &quot;JOSCore&quot; into the ground by giving it too many
incompatible definitions. Can't we invent a new name for the JOS start-up
sequence? Can't we define a new term for the four or five concepts
previously known as JOSCore?

There is an issue of distribution. If JOSCore is not an issue of
distribution, what shall we call the minimum distribution of JOS? How much
needs to exist before an operating system is called JOS? Does jJOS/decaf
qualify as a JOS-compatible operating system?

For example, the start-up sequence might be known as JOSBoot. At JOSBoot, a
kernel and virtual machine need to be loaded, forming the JOSBox. I
understood the mechanism to work this way: JOSBoot loads a kernel. JOSBoot
instructs the kernel to load, bind and run a virtual machine. Both
Etherboot and GRUB qualify as JOSBoot.

jJOS/decaf are statically linked. When jJOS/decaf are loaded with Etherboot
or GRUB, there is no distinction between kernel and virtual machine. The
entire JOSBox is loaded together. What is needed to make jJOS/decaf more
JOS-compatible?

With kernel modules, kernel interface, a start-up sequence and
distribution, what is left for JOSCore?

Might JOSCore be too abstract for me to understand today because we don't
have more than one JOS-compatible operating system?

I would like to see a three-dimensional view of JOSBox and JOSystem. It
might help us better understand JOSCore.
