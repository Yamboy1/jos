<PRE>&gt;<i> Why does JOSCore come before the kernel?
</I>
	For much the same reason that BSD comes before Mach when you're
talking about OS X, I would think -- but I may be thinking of a different
JOSCore than others are.

	Any java platform needs a JVM.  That's one component of JOS.  Any
operating system needs an API.  That's one component of JOS, but it gets
(a little) tricky here.  Sun has defined an enourmous API that with which
we must remain compatible.  That API, however, is inadequate for systems
programming.  JOS must define its own system API for systems programming.  
This needs name -- the SystemAPI, for now.  Very probably, we will want to
include higher-level abstractions as part what we require of a JOS
distribution; this, too, needs a name -- call it the ApplicationAPI.  
Because of the vastness of Sun's library, the ApplicationAPI will probably
be rather small.

	So we have two pieces which are externally evident -- the System
and Application APIs -- and one which is internally necessary.  These two
APIs, for the most part, define JOS.  The parts they do not define all
operate in support of them -- including the JVM.  The purpose of having a
standard interface between pieces behind these APIs is to allow them to be
replaced like one would bricks in a wall.  (Beware, incoming
metaphor.)  It is not important to anyone aside from the bricklayer and
the brickmaker how the wall of a museum is constructed, so long as it does
not detract from the art hanging on it.*

	Right now, the wall is only made of two bricks -- the (decaf) JVM
and the (jJOS) kernel.**  The only interface we, at present, require, is
the kernel/JVM interface.  This interface must exist and be consistent
even if we don't ever use another kernel or JVM, just to make porting to a
new architecture feasible.

	As it stands, it's entirely the responsibility and problem of the
kernel to get itself booted.  Unless anyone has a good reason to think
that Etherboot and GRUB won't satisfy our booting needs indefinitely, I
don't think there's a need to spend time and energy on a boot
specification.

	In general, I feel the best way to write a spec is to write an
implementation first, and then write the spec to reflect the way it ought
to be when you re-write the implemention to get it right...

* It is for this reason that I haven't bothered to rewrite jJOS/decaf to
comply with any interface specifications; since, AFAIK, there is only one
kernel and only one VM under development for JOS, it seems rather silly to
spend time on it when decaf needs so much work.

** Though the distinction between the two could be considered rather
arbitrary, it'll firm up with the first port off the IA32.
