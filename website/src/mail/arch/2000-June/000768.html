I'll have to reconsider using CLASSPATH.

I'll have to reconsider using an HTTP service. Should the creation of a
boot disk depend on HTTP? I don't know.

I wonder if the GUI application should have another field for the location
of the external resources. If you type in the location, it can be a local
directory or HTTP URL. That would completely separate the program from its
data.

&gt;<i>Well, if you want to do systems programming in java, you need to write a
</I>&gt;<i>new extension to java and a special java compiler to handle it.  It
</I>&gt;<i>shouldn't be too big a stretch since its been done before with other
</I>&gt;<i>languages (but could be a good amount of work).
</I>
A system programming language might support an extension of a native method
with assembler or C/C++. I really don't like the idea of keeping my .java
and .c code in separate files.

  public native void example() {
    // C code goes here.
  }

&gt;&gt;<i> CLASSPATH always available as a system property?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>yes and no.  It doesn't have to be but it is for now.  its an
</I>&gt;<i>implementation detail I believe.  Once again, i could be wrong since I
</I>&gt;<i>don't have my spec with me.
</I>
If CLASSPATH is unreliable, it won't help. Maybe CLASSPATH is missing from
a browser?

&gt;<i>Well, its not the virtual machine but rather a hex editor you need (even
</I>&gt;<i>nicer, a java class hex editor that understands proper java class file
</I>&gt;<i>format).
</I>
Huh? I meant something else. At runtime, a class does not have access to
its own bytecode. The defineClass() method gets a byte array but doesn't
let a class know where it is. Only a virtual machine has that kind of access.

&gt;<i>No.  Why not just use a File object.
</I>
That is worth considering.

&gt;<i>OK.  Essentially the same thing.  Just making sure you weren't hoping to
</I>&gt;<i>use just java to get the write done.  :)
</I>
The GUI application would create a boot disk image. With instructions, a
Windows user could manually rawwrite it to a diskette, too. The GUI
application is meant to reduce the complexity of creating a boot disk
image. There are quite a few Etherboot options.
