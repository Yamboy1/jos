This topic is appropriate for the Architecture group, too. Some members
feel that the AWT must be implemented as soon as possible. Some members
feel that AWT doesn't need to be implemented at all.

I always work from the bottom up. My development method includes building
upon things that work. If it doesn't work, don't build upon it.

Here is a question for this list: Should the AWT be standardized for JOS?
If so, why?

How do we write AWT without a memory manager?

&gt;<i>The first AWT implementation may be simply VGA 640x480x16, but the only

</I>&gt;<i>Or is there more work to be done that I just have not comprehended yet?
</I>&gt;<i>Anyway, I believe that a simple and limited implementation is better than

</I>&gt;<i>advanced implementations.  And honestly, the only thing an AWT needs is a
</I>&gt;<i>way to receive input and to bitblt images onto the screen (thanks to the
</I>&gt;<i>standardVGA driver).  Anyway, I'm rambling.  Please tell me if the kernel/VM
</I>&gt;<i>is in a state where this might be reasonable to start working on (i.e. does
</I>&gt;<i>the VGA driver work as advertised, is the VM stable enough, etc).
</I>
I agree with you: a simple and limited implementation is better than
nothing. With the completion of a boot-able jJOS/decaf in text mode, the
next milestone on my list is the JOS-specific implementation of AWT. I only
wish I had more time to work on it.

The AWT is complicated by the fact that java.awt.Toolkit is in the java.awt
package instead of the java.awt.peer package. It creates a mutual package
dependency, where two packages depend on each other (java.awt depends on
java.awt.peer and java.awt.peer depends on java.awt).

Our first goal should be exclusively to output to VGA, not interaction. We
should be able to demonstrate the use of a VGA screen without a keyboard
and mouse. If we write a simple demo program that draws continuously to a
VGA screen, it would help us work through the simple stuff. Such a demo
program would be similar to a screen saver, with only limited interaction.

Personally, I have only worked on blitting character-based images, in the
style of Turbo Vision and Curses. I have every reason to believe that it is
the same thing.

  public void blit( Point a, Dimension d, byte[] v );
  public void blit( Point a, Point b, byte[] v );

In addition, it must also be able to read the screen:

  public byte[] read( Point a, Dimension d );
  public byte[] read( Point a, Point b );

Blit and read are complementary, so that reading a region after blitting it
should return the same image. Further discussion of AWT should be part of
the User Interface group, shouldn't it? The kernel/virtual machine might
plug in any implementation of AWT.
