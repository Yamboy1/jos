</I>
I'm saying that JOSCore isn't written in any code (metaphorically,) it
is just a division to help us design JOS and a seed to base all of our
distributions on. JOSCore may never be distributed, but it would both
be-in and be-the-same-in every distribution.
 
&gt;<i> Why does JOSCore come before the kernel?
</I>
It doesn't, it /includes/ the kernel. As I said, I thought
JOSCore/JOSExtensions were _just_ divisions of JOSystem but now I think
they are more abstract then that and that they are divisions of _both_
JOSystem and JOSBox.
 
&gt;<i> Are you saying that we can write a platform-independent kernel on top of a
</I>&gt;<i> platform-dependent JOSCore?
</I>
No, but I do think the JOSCore section of JOSystem should act as a
platform-independent kernel on top of JOSBox (as it is, basically
virtual hardware)
 
&gt;<i> Are JOSExtensions written in machine code too?
</I>
You mean to ask if JOSExtensions will be written entirely in machine
code like JOSCore *but* JOSCore isn't written entirely in machine code,
the JOSBox section of JOSCore is while the JOSystem section is not. So
JOSExtensions will be written in machine code also, but not exclusively.
 
&gt;<i> We have defined a kernel and its kernel modules. Both a kernel and its
</I>&gt;<i> kernel modules are compiled to machine code and, at runtime, are
</I>&gt;<i> platform-dependent. A JOS-compatible kernel would be able to load
</I>&gt;<i> JOS-compatible kernel modules. Loading a JOS-compatible kernel modules must
</I>&gt;<i> include fix-up, or binding a kernel module to the kernel.
</I>
I don't know much about such things, but from my understanding I'd say
the kernel modules are JOSExtensions. In other words the kernel /core/
is made up of two parts the kernel (bootstrap) and the abstractions and
binding methods (builder) for the modules, or /extensions/. You may have
also noticed that I broke my definition of core into two elements: The
bootstrap, the part of core that initializes its self and the builder,
the part that glues the necessary extensions on. I see a bootstrap and a
builder in the JOSBox-JOSCore and one in the JOSystem-JOSCore.
 
&gt;<i> At least, we can agree that JOSCore is neither jos.core nor org.jos.core.
</I>
Almost to the point where it doesn't have to be said.
 
&gt;<i> We have defined a kernel interface. RJK has consistently called the layer
</I>&gt;<i> between a portable kernel and non-portable kernel as a kernel interface. A
</I>&gt;<i> portable kernel is made platform-specific at compile-time. A JOS-compatible
</I>&gt;<i> kernel might load JOS-compatible kernel modules, all written in machine code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When a virtual machine is a JOS-compatible kernel module, any
</I>&gt;<i> JOS-compatible kernel can load it, bind it and run it. A virtual machine
</I>&gt;<i> becomes a plug-in to the kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe we have run &quot;JOSCore&quot; into the ground by giving it too many
</I>&gt;<i> incompatible definitions. Can't we invent a new name for the JOS start-up
</I>&gt;<i> sequence? Can't we define a new term for the four or five concepts
</I>&gt;<i> previously known as JOSCore?
</I>
This may be a necessity, but it may also prove useful -- we all being
fastidious people (mentally at least) will be forced to think of what
something is before we can think of what we call it.
 
&gt;<i> There is an issue of distribution. If JOSCore is not an issue of
</I>&gt;<i> distribution, what shall we call the minimum distribution of JOS? How much
</I>&gt;<i> needs to exist before an operating system is called JOS? Does jJOS/decaf
</I>&gt;<i> qualify as a JOS-compatible operating system?
</I>
It both is and isn't the minimum distribution, in the sense that JOSCore
by itself is useless and would only make a technical distribution (I'm
guessing with the platform-specific code uncompiled since none but true
experimenters would want it...). A minimal distribution would be close
to a minimal JOS but it would probably still have such things as a file
system and JADE (albeit with a small CLI.)
 
&gt;<i> For example, the start-up sequence might be known as JOSBoot. At JOSBoot, a
</I>&gt;<i> kernel and virtual machine need to be loaded, forming the JOSBox. I
</I>&gt;<i> understood the mechanism to work this way: JOSBoot loads a kernel. JOSBoot
</I>&gt;<i> instructs the kernel to load, bind and run a virtual machine. Both
</I>&gt;<i> Etherboot and GRUB qualify as JOSBoot.
</I>
This is what I called the &quot;bootstrap element of JOSBox's JOSCore
section,&quot; as always over-intellectulization has created uncomprehensible
complex neologisms; or, in other words, I'm happy with calling it
JOSBoot if everyone else is.
 
&gt;<i> jJOS/decaf are statically linked. When jJOS/decaf are loaded with Etherboot
</I>&gt;<i> or GRUB, there is no distinction between kernel and virtual machine. The
</I>&gt;<i> entire JOSBox is loaded together. What is needed to make jJOS/decaf more
</I>&gt;<i> JOS-compatible?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With kernel modules, kernel interface, a start-up sequence and
</I>&gt;<i> distribution, what is left for JOSCore?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Might JOSCore be too abstract for me to understand today because we don't
</I>&gt;<i> have more than one JOS-compatible operating system?
</I>
Possibly, but I'd like to give it one more try.... First of all let me
say that by my definition a JOS-compatible OS is any OS with JOSCore
(even if you couldn't run the same apps on them or even have them
communicate together) it was thinking about what &quot;JOS-compatible&quot; meant
that led me to extend my previous definition. 

My old way of thinking was a bit clearer, it divided JOSystem into
JOSCore and JOSExtensions -- perhaps this is a better way to think about
it, and perhaps Ill return to this old mode of thinking.

My new way of thinking is that when we add something to JOS we should
ask ourselves &quot;is this, really truly necessary? is it more
compatible/economical to add an extra layer of abstraction?&quot; or &quot;is this
part of JOSCore, or should it be a JOSExtension?&quot; Maybe I don't
understand the design of JOSBox well enough, but I think the
core/extension classification applies to it as well.

Then I realized that JOSBox/JOSystem and JOSCore/JOSExtensions were two
different ways of dividing the same thing, two different perspectives,
the former from a system-level, the latter from a design level. I also
noticed how perfectly they overlap:

If imagine JOS as a square:

+-----+
|<i>     |
</I>|<i> JOS |
</I>|<i>     |
</I>+-----+


And you draw a horizontal line in the middle of the square (the
machine-/byte-code boundary) you get this:

+--------+
|<i>JOSystem|
</I>+--------+
|<i>JOSBox  |
</I>+--------+

If you redrew the square then drew a vertical line down its center (the
need/want boundary) you get this:

+---------+---------------+
|<i>         |               |
</I>|<i> JOSCore | JOSExtensions |
</I>|<i>         |               |
</I>+---------+---------------+

It's still the same square, just two different ways of looking at it,
now if we overlay the two diagrams, we get this:

+------------------+------------------------+
|<i> JOSystem-JOSCore | JOSystem-JOSExtensions |
</I>+------------------+------------------------+
|<i> JOSBox-JOSCore   | JOSBox-JOSExtensions   |
</I>+------------------+------------------------+

Or perhaps a bit more clearly:

+-----------------------+
|<i>JOSystem               |
</I>|<i>JOSCore | JOSExtensions|
</I>+-----------------------+
|<i>JOSBox                 |
</I>|<i>JOSCore | JOSExtensions|
</I>+--------+--------------+


Even if I'm wrong, I hope at least was able to explain my self (I'm
getting ASCII-box cramp)
 
&gt;<i> I would like to see a three-dimensional view of JOSBox and JOSystem. It
</I>&gt;<i> might help us better understand JOSCore.
</I>
I posted a really rotten (Image creation is harder then I thought it
would be) 3D description, but I think the above makes more sense 

Cheers,

	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial

	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
