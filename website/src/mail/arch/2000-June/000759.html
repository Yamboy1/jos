<PRE>To get back on the multiple stage VMs...
I'll try and clarify more on what I had in mind. (long update !!!)

The project name I find very attractive is 'Black'.
Black refers to the purity of JAVA: &quot;No milk or sugar added, just JAVA&quot;.

But let's get back to reality.
In my previous mail I talked about VM1 and VM2. Maybe the VMx keywords are
a little bit too optimistic about there functionalities. I'll better call
them JIT1 and JIT2.

STAGE 1:

+------+
|<i>      |
</I>|<i> JIT1 |
</I>|<i>      |
</I>+------+

JIT1 is a JIT compiler, written entirely in JAVA.
JIT1 has got some modules. These modules are responsible for compiling JAVA
bytecode to a certain processor. JIT1 can have:
 - jos.black.jit.intel.I386Compiler
 - jos.black.jit.intel.I486Compiler
 - jos.black.jit.intel.I586Compiler
 - jos.black.jit.amd.P6Compiler
 - jos.black.jit.ibm.AS400Compiler
 - jos.black.jit.extensions.intel.MMXCompiler
 - jos.black.jit.extensions.amd.3DNowCompiler
 etc.

</I>
Let's say we have an Intel 486 PC and an Intel 586MMX PC.
If we install a distribution of Linux on these PC's, they will both get a
kernel compiled for I386. This means that we don't use all of the
capabilities of the processor. The only thing to get max performance is to
recompile the Linux kernel (and ALL other Linux programs!) with a 486
option and a 586MMX option. Now we have 2 kernels on 2 PC's.
Things get ever worse if we upgrade (or downgrade) one of the processors.
Then we'll have to recompile the entire kernel again!
This procedure is absolutely a no-go for the default user (me...) and for
network-administrators.

Therefor I do think we need to go for the following construction:

JIT1 will be compiled for the lowest platform in a range, say I386.
JIT1 only has the classes in jos.black.JIT.* and beyond. NO java.*, javax.
*, com.* or whatsoever, only classes needed to do JIT-related stuff. This
makes JIT1 quite small.

The JIT1 binary AND the classfiles from JIT1 (jos_black_jit.jar?) will be
installed on both PC's. When booted, JIT1 will determine on what kind of
processor it is running. When it sees a 586MMX Processor, it will recompile
a copy of ITSELF (JIT2) to a binary for a 586 Processor with MMX extension.
This proces will take very little time, because only the classes from
jos_black_jit.jar (and from this only the classes needed for a 586MMX
compiler) have to be compiled.

STAGE 2:

+------+
|<i>      |   +------+
</I>|<i> JIT1 |--&gt;| JIT2 |
</I>|<i>      |   +------+
</I>+------+

JIT2 will even be smaller than JIT1, because it won't have modules for
processors higher or different from a 586MMX in its codebase.

JIT1 will now unload itself and give control to JIT2. JIT2 can compile
classes a lot faster now.

STAGE 3:

           +------+
           | JIT2 |
           +------+

Well, not quite. There will be one 'real' VM: BlackVM. This will be the VM
that handles all of the OS responsabilities: memory management,
task-switching, iterrupts, IO, etc.

STAGE 4:
                     +---------+
       +------+      |         |
       | JIT2 |-----&gt;| BlackVM |
       +------+      |         |
                 +---+---------+------+
                 |        |           |
            +--------+ +--------+ +--------+
            |   IO   | | Memory | |  Task  |
            | Module | | Module | | Module |
            +--------+ +--------+ +--------+

BlackVM will be able to load multiple default class-libraries. It will have
one class-library for itself (Black's own java.* classes) but it should
also be able to load Sun's rt.jar, Microsoft's classes.zip and even
Personal Java's classfiles (personal_classes.zip?).

STAGE 5:

                                            +----------------------+
                 +---------+              +-| Black's java classes |
   +------+      |         |              | +----------------------+
   | JIT2 |-----&gt;| BlackVM |--------------+
   +------+      |         |              | +----------------------+
             +---+---------+------+       +-| Sun's java classes   |
             |        |           |       | +----------------------+
        +--------+ +--------+ +--------+  |            .
        |   IO   | | Memory | |  Task  |  |            .
        | Module | | Module | | Module |  | +----------------------+
        +--------+ +--------+ +--------+  +-| XXX's java classes   |
                                            +----------------------+

On previous mailthreads, there was talk about that a process (or VM) only
need different classloaders. These classloaders can now be build to ask
Black VM for the appropriate java.* classes.


MACHINECODE

&gt;<i> Machine code can be embedded in a class file as a method attribute. The

</I>
How temptive that sounds, I do not think that it is a very good idea. It
will just contribute to fragmentation of the the java platform. Also, I
want to be able to program JOS/Black with just my favorite editors and
compilers (SUN/J++/IBM VA/etc.).
Look at my previous code:

package asm.i386;

class File extends I386_Assembly
{
   /*
    * Code to execute a call to byte[] java.io.File.readBytes( int n )
    */
   public static void readBytes()
   {
      asm.write( MOV, BX, SP );       // get the File object
      asm.write( DEC, SP );
      asm.write( MOV, AX, SP );       // get parameter n
      asm.write( DEC, SP );

      asm.write(......)               // do the IO-things

      asm.write( MOV, SP, AX );       // return the byte array
      asm.write( RET );
   }
}


The asm object can just be some kind of OutputStream where the opcodes for
the MOV instructions are to be written. The first call (from process A) to
readBytes() will trigger JIT2 to execute the function once, get the
resulting machinecodes written to the asm object, construct a methodblock
around it, and finally redirect the call from process A to the newly
created methodblock. All subsequent calls to readBytes() will also be
redirected to the methodblock.

This way we still maintain compatability in our java-sources and
classfiles, only a change in the VM is needed to accomplish the on-the-fly
assembly.



Hope to hear some more of you all...

Menno.
