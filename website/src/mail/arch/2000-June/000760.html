<PRE>Today I felt like working on some graphics stuff again, so I compiled some
native code to allow me to run Thomas Boceks' VGA driver on Linux. 

I had to do an iopl(3) to allow the linux process to access the IO ports.

Then I telnetted to a linux box and ran the java interpreter on there as
root.

The driver seems to switch the video mode, but I don't see the jos logo as
expected (the bitblt routine should show the logo). 

I suspect the problem may be that the linux graphics drivers are already
running to enable the virtual text consoles. They are probably putting 
the card in some mode that the driver doesn't expect. Does anyone know how
I can disable these consoles, or somehow unload the graphics driver?

Another question:

I have about 3 ATI RageII (mach64) graphics cards and I would love to
write some Java drivers to use these. Probably just enabling a 1024x768x16
mode would be a great achievement, but I don't really know enough about
video hardware to do this easily. 

I have the source code for the mach64 drivers from XFree86, but I need
more background knowledge about how this stuff works. Can someone
recommend a book or a web article that would help me out?
