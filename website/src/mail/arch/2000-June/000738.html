<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; This also raises the issue of eventually having JOS self-hosting,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ultimately it would be nice to write a C / C++ compiler in Java (on top of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the assembler), along with a linker and then we'ld be free from UNIX. (Not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that I don't love Unix!).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with this.  Assemblers are relatively easy to write.  My 
</I>&gt;<i> current very small campaign has been to have the native code 
</I>&gt;<i> written in C because its a much simpler language to write 
</I>&gt;<i> compilers for (if and when that task ever comes up).

You mean as opposed to C++?

I must say I agree. Although OO is a huge bonus and makes code a lot
cleaner (for example decaf compared to my JVM written in C) I'm wary of
the complexity of C++ compilers.

Currently I'm writing little &quot;routines&quot; and &quot;fragments&quot; of assembly as I
implement my JIT. Sometimes however I need to call back into native C
code to access some structures and stuff.

I hope to replace this by allowing the assembler to &quot;understand&quot; a C
structure and access it's members in a macro-like fashion.

If there was object inheritance and stuff happening there it would make
life very much more complicated.
