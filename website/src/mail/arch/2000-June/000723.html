<PRE>Perhaps this topic is more appropriate for the Kernel group, but I was
looking at the JOS1f dist the other day and realized that only a few more
parts need to be in place in order to start working on an AWT
implementation.  Is this assumption correct (Todd, Matt, Gilbert, et al)?

The first AWT implementation may be simply VGA 640x480x16, but the only
things that seem to be missing are hooks for the keyboard and mouse input.
Or is there more work to be done that I just have not comprehended yet?
Anyway, I believe that a simple and limited implementation is better than
nothing, it at least serves as a starting point for more complex and
advanced implementations.  And honestly, the only thing an AWT needs is a
way to receive input and to bitblt images onto the screen (thanks to the
standardVGA driver).  Anyway, I'm rambling.  Please tell me if the kernel/VM
is in a state where this might be reasonable to start working on (i.e. does
the VGA driver work as advertised, is the VM stable enough, etc).
