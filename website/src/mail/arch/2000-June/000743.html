<PRE>I've been looking over the Wiki, seeing what I wrote previously on
JOSCore/JOSExtensions and was surprised by the many naming conflicts I
created as my own ideas evolved. I would like to atone by clearly
defining these terms as they are now understood by me.

JOSCore is a minimalists dream, it is a pure OS unfettered by concerns
of the user and only remotely interested in the concerns of the computer
it is the first domino to fall when the computer is powered on, JOSCore
is the method for loading JOSExtensions it is the /base/ of the /base/
of JOS, it is both the abstractions for all JOSExtensions and the
mechanism for attaching them to itself. It is the nexus of the Gestalt
(if you wanna get real wordy.)

JOSExtensions are what allow JOS to be useful. They are the atomics of
the OS, built around the genetic code of JOSCore; without them JOSCore
would be useless. I doubt you could even run an application without
several extensions.

JOSBox is the kernel and the VM, it's more complicated then that but
basically it is hardware not in copper in silicon but in binary, Java
runs on a Virtual Machine it only makes sense that JOS should run on a
Virtual Platform (VP?)

JOSystem is the OS we strive for, everything else is just a means to
this end. JOSBox starts and runs JOSystem like a BIOS loads a
traditional OS. JOSystem qua JOSCore is a set of abstractions for
loading the JOSystem JOSExtensions. On a desktop or a server or any
traditional setting JOSystem would load the file system abstraction
extension and what ever filesystem(s) are in use it would load the
process and security managers and most likely a few applications, like
JADE.

JOSPlatform is a JOSBox and JOSystem, originally I thought of JOSCore
and JOSExtensions being merely a division of JOSystem but now I realize
that there is a core to the JOSBox and it has many extensions (although
mostly the extensions will be exactly the same with additional ones
added for functions specific to a certain system, the bulk though would
only be altered for embedded systems and things of that ilk.) So, JOSBox
and JOSystem are a layer division while JOSCore and JOSExtensions are a
core division. I think the confusion on everyone's part (including me,
until recently) is that we, or I at any rate, was thinking
two-dimensionally when the distinctions were three dimensional. That is,
I saw JOS like this:

 +---------------------+
 |      JOSBox         |
 +---------------------+
 |    JOSystem         |
 |JOSCore|JOSExtensions|
 +---------------------+

When it was really like this:

  X-&gt;         Y-&gt;
 Z+--------+ Z+----+-+----+
 || JOSBox | ||   J|J|J   |
 v+--------+ v|   O|O|O   |
  |        |  |   S|S|S   |
  |        |  |   E|C|E   |
  |        |  |   x|o|x   |
  |        |  |   t|r|t   |
  |JOSystem|  |   e|e|e   |
  |        |  |   n| |n   |
  |        |  |   s| |s   |
  |        |  |   i| |i   |
  |        |  |   o| |o   |
  |        |  |   n| |n   |
  |        |  |   s| |    |
  +--------+  +----+-+----+

That is as close as I can represent it without making a 3D chart in
ASCII, which I wont do for various, obvious reasons.

Cheers,
DigiGod

	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
