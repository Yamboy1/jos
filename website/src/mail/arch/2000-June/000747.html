Another good reason to build on Java2D is its support of the Graphic Driver
classes.  It has already established a class model for graphics drivers and
multiple display modes.  I did a tad bit of work on this when decaf was in
its infancy (before case statements were supported!).  This is a good
starting point.  We may not need to support *everything* Java2D has to
start with, though.  Alpha colors in 16-bit VGA mode are a little
rediculous :-)

Colonel Edwards: This is the most fantastic story I've ever heard.
Jeff Trent: And every word of it's true, too.
Colonel Edwards: That's the fantastic part of it.
