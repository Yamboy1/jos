<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; My personal view on the kernel however is different, especially since I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have little knowledge of low-level programming and kernel programming. In
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my opinion I would prefer to host the JVM on an established microkernel, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know of a few that are options:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	I, personally, don't have any objections to hosting on another
</I>&gt;<i> kernel, though I won't port decaf (to whatever extent is required) away
</I>&gt;<i> from JJOS unless/until I need to do something that JJOS does not
</I>&gt;<i> provide.  Since JM has been inactive in development for quite some time
</I>&gt;<i> now, it grows more and more likely that I will hit a wall sooner than
</I>&gt;<i> later.  We'll probably see it in writing support for a class library; I
</I>&gt;<i> may have to end up adopting a kernel that does dynamic linking and
</I>&gt;<i> multiple native processes.  (Sigh.)
</I>
In my opinion the most important requirement is kernel support for
threads. 

When I implemented the class library support for IO (file and networking)
it became painfully apparent that either you need a kernel with native
threads or you need to jump through hoops to make the native IO code act
like it was blocking when it fact it wasn't.

&gt;<i> &gt; I hope I don't sound patronising in the above, I think you're doing a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; great job. (I do sometimes get a bit frustrated with the speed of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development though -- but I also understand the enormity of the task ... )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	I also get frustrated with the speed of development, but there's a
</I>&gt;<i> hard limit on how much coding a single mind can handle in a single day,
</I>&gt;<i> and I'm sure you can guess what my job is...
</I>
:<i>-). I have great respect for people with day jobs who manage to work on
</I>other projects in their spare time. Since I'm studying full-time I have
the freedom to spend any amount of time in a day on open-source projects,
it's a luxury I should be more grateful for ;-).

John
