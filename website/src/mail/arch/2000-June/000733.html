<PRE>I believe the JOS Project is a research project. It is a research project,
isn't it?

As a research project, I believe there is more to JOS than just jJOS/decaf.
JOS is more than jJOS/decaf, isn't it? jJOS/decaf is a JOS subproject.
There is room for more than one subproject under the JOS umbrella.

Once again, it has been suggested on the JavaLobby to build a
&quot;distribution&quot; of Linux that uses Java applications instead of C++
applications. Why do others get the mistaken impression that the JOS
Project has a very narrow focus on building a Java Virtual Machine?
Development of a Java Virtual Machine might be a worthwhile project. It
might be a admirable effort. It might be necessary to develop the ultimate
expression of a Java-rich operating system.

There is a better way. The JOS Project should re-invent itself as a portal
for all kinds of Java-based operating systems. That's right; there must be
more than one. We must re-invent ourselves to attract the kind of
programmers we need to finish the ultimate JOS.

I am convinced that 80% or more of a Java-based operating system will run
-- verbatim -- on more than one kernel/virtual machine. While I applaud the
effort to write a new kernel/virtual machine, I am not convinced we need to
write our own kernel or write our own virtual machine. We can take an
existing kernel and rework it. We can take an existing virtual machine and
rework it.

We should make a public statement (press release) on the JavaLobby website
explaining that we, the JOS Project, are already working on a combination
of Linux and Java to build a Java-rich operating system. Such an operating
system cannot be exclusively Java. As we know, much of it must be written
in machine code.

With a transitional platform, like SimpleJOS, many tools and applications
can be identified, organized and collected together under the JOS umbrella.
The JOS website should point to existing websites, not replace them. The
JOS website should build on its strength: to collect together more links
than any Java-rich operating system website.

KaffeOS has its own website and should be a JOS subproject. jJOS/decaf
should have its own &quot;website&quot;. SimpleJOS should have its own website.

Besides, the ultimate combination of Java and Linux is only a
specification. A public forum is required to put together the best
specification. Many people have good ideas about existing products that
would fill out the operating system to stand alone. It is not a new kernel
or virtual machine. It is not a distribution. I would like to use an
existing mailing list, like <A HREF="mailto:apps@jos.org">apps@jos.org</A> as a public forum to build the
Java-rich operating system.

Remember that jJOS/decaf needs these applications, too. I believe the Java
community would be willing and able to identify all of the applications
that have already been written that might be used for a Java-rich operating
system.

Starting with transitional JOS, we could replace C/C++ components with
equivalent bytecode until there is nothing but bytecode -- giving us
ultimate JOS. Transitional JOS runs on a foreign operating system,
including both Linux and Windows.
