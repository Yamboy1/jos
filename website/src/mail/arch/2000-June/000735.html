<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe the JOS Project is a research project. It is a research
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project, isn't it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	The last time /I/ checked TheGoal, it was &quot;To create, distribute,
</I>&gt;<i> and support a free and open operating system implementing the
</I>&gt;<i> Java(tm) Platform.&quot;  While creation, distribution, and support all may
</I>&gt;<i> involve research, the operating system is our goal.
</I>
I don't see JOS as a research project, for me the purpose is to create a
working, usable Java-based OS.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; I believe there is more to JOS than just jJOS/decaf.
</I>... 
&gt;<i> 	If someone were to begin customizing another JVM, it is possible
</I>&gt;<i> that they could both argue me out of my position that a ground-up custom
</I>&gt;<i> JVM is a better solution and convince me to work on the port.  Until then,
</I>&gt;<i> I will continue to work on decaf.
</I>
I have been working a JVM &quot;of my own&quot; for about a year and a half now. The
last time I compared it to decaf it was more &quot;feature-complete&quot; with GC
working, support for Classpath, reflection, native threads and
accompanying IO libraries etc.

But I support the decaf effort, there is nothing more rewarding than
attacking a fairly complex problem (like a JVM / Kernel etc) and coding
and understanding it from bottom-to-top.

This is exactly the reason I have devoted so many hundreds of hours to my
JVM. I use it mostly for my own research and as such it is extremely
beneficial to know it backwards.

In the same vein the developers of JOS should have an intimate aquaintance
with the core of the OS. The people putting the effort into the JVM
development ultimately must decide how they go about it. Since I am not
contributing anything to the effort (at the moment) I consider Todd and
John to be the custodians of this area of development.

It is possible to use an outside JVM to accelerate the JOS project a bit,
but I don't know how many people would enjoy such an effort. 

My personal view on the kernel however is different, especially since I
have little knowledge of low-level programming and kernel programming. In
my opinion I would prefer to host the JVM on an established microkernel, I
know of a few that are options:

RTEMS
GNU Mach
rtmk
some kind of OSKit build


I hope I don't sound patronising in the above, I think you're doing a
great job. (I do sometimes get a bit frustrated with the speed of
development though -- but I also understand the enormity of the task ... )

Jumping to another topic:

My latest work with my JVM has been a JIT (written in Java) that uses an
IA32 assembler (also written in Java). It's not an &quot;everything gets
compiled before it runs&quot; type of system, rather the interpreter interacts
with compiled code. The whole implementation is quite tricky, but I hope
to bring whatever I have learned / produced to JOS in a few months time.

This also raises the issue of eventually having JOS self-hosting,
ultimately it would be nice to write a C / C++ compiler in Java (on top of
the assembler), along with a linker and then we'ld be free from UNIX. (Not
that I don't love Unix!).
