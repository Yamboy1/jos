If I understand a JavaObject correctly, I'm pretty sure this is the essence
of an object-sharing mechanism in a multiple process virtual machine.

Internal to a virtual machine, I should be able to share() an object in
basically the same way I can clone() it. The share() method might
automatically load classes in a new primordial class loader. Potentially,
this is equivalent to fork(). Imagine that! You could fully duplicate a
bytecode process by a single call to share().

The new operator always creates something owned by a bytecode process. A
shared-new operator must create something owned by a bytecode process too,
and yet, it shares instance fields that already exist in another bytecode
process. The mutex for synchronization must be shared, so that even threads
from different bytecode processes respect the synchronized sections.

A JavaObject sounds like it points to its class and points to its instance
fields. Its class must not be shared. Its instance fields can be shared. An
object-sharing mechanism can work with all kinds of class loaders, not just
the primordial kind.

Earlier, I described type safety in detail. There are three cases:
identical, equal and equivalent. Identical and equal are &quot;easy&quot; in
bytecode. We might provide a hard-coded list of well-known casts that are
allowed for equivalent classes. Once an object-sharing mechanism has
allowed an object to be cast, a thread doesn't treat an object differently
just because it is shared. A thread always runs at full speed. None of the
opcode methods are adversely affected by sharing.

Does this mean that a Java object without instance fields, like
java.lang.Runnable, is always safe to type cast? Maybe it does.

If JavaObject &quot;points&quot; to instance fields, JavaObject is already a proxy to
an object's state. Could it be that simple? Maybe it is.

Obviously, garbage collection must be aware of two JavaObjects that share a
collection of instance fields. State must be garbage collected when there
are no more objects that refer to it.

It makes me think of the other extreme, where methods are ignored. A
certain level of literal compatibility is possible. Two classes with two
different names could be &quot;compatible&quot; if they happen to have the same
number/type of instance fields, in the same order. Here is an example,
because field names are arbitrary:

public class ClassA {
  private int i;
  private float f;
  private long l;
  private double d;
}

public class ClassB {
  private int size;
  private float percent;
  private long time;
  private double angle;
}

Here is another because, interally, short and int may be identical:

public class PointA {
  private short x;
  private short y;
}

public class PointB {
  private int x;
  private int y;
}

I can see where that kind of object sharing might be useful to data
conversion, upgrades and re-serialization. It sure helps with compatibility
across different implementations of a package.

Of course, I would prefer to start out with a conservative approach where
objects can be shared only if their bytecode is identical or equal.
