<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This topic is appropriate for the Architecture group, too. Some members
</I>&gt;<i> feel that the AWT must be implemented as soon as possible. Some members
</I>&gt;<i> feel that AWT doesn't need to be implemented at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I always work from the bottom up. My development method includes building
</I>&gt;<i> upon things that work. If it doesn't work, don't build upon it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a question for this list: Should the AWT be standardized for JOS?
</I>&gt;<i> If so, why?
</I>
I believe that it might be a good idea to standardize the AWT, but it's
got to be extremely pluggable -- and that's a problem with the original
AWT design.  It was made to simply latch on to already-present native
user-interface code.  I know JADE has tried to do this (pluggability),
but JADE was never properly defined, and so never began implementation,
or even functional design for that matter.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How do we write AWT without a memory manager?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Good question. For now, the AWT will have to do its own memory management,
at least w.r.t. images (oh, boy what am I getting in to? :)

&gt;<i> I agree with you: a simple and limited implementation is better than
</I>&gt;<i> nothing. With the completion of a boot-able jJOS/decaf in text mode, the
</I>&gt;<i> next milestone on my list is the JOS-specific implementation of AWT. I
</I>only
&gt;<i> wish I had more time to work on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The AWT is complicated by the fact that java.awt.Toolkit is in the
</I>java.awt
&gt;<i> package instead of the java.awt.peer package. It creates a mutual package
</I>&gt;<i> dependency, where two packages depend on each other (java.awt depends on
</I>&gt;<i> java.awt.peer and java.awt.peer depends on java.awt).
</I>
I completely agree.  The AWT was a kludge to quickly get Java-based UI's
on existing systems.  It was never a good design, even after Sun
&quot;fixed&quot; it (aka AWT1.1, Swing (blech)).  Unfortunately, in order for
maximum compatibility, we have to support it.  That doesn't mean we can't
improve the back-end of it, we just have to make sure it's compliant.

&gt;<i> Our first goal should be exclusively to output to VGA, not interaction. We
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to demonstrate the use of a VGA screen without a keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> and mouse. If we write a simple demo program that draws continuously to a
</I>&gt;<i> VGA screen, it would help us work through the simple stuff. Such a demo
</I>&gt;<i> program would be similar to a screen saver, with only limited interaction.
</I>
I agree, in fact, the first thing I was going to do is figure out how to
represent images so that I could draw a component on screen (even if it is
just a Canvas).

&gt;<i> Personally, I have only worked on blitting character-based images, in the
</I>&gt;<i> style of Turbo Vision and Curses. I have every reason to believe that it
</I>is
&gt;<i> the same thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   public void blit( Point a, Dimension d, byte[] v );
</I>&gt;<i>   public void blit( Point a, Point b, byte[] v );
</I>
Right now, the VGA blit style is more like

 blit(int x, int y, int[] image, int linelength)

but that be changed or extended (extended is probably better).  &quot;byte&quot;s
are more compact and economical too, although a bit harder to work
with.  It appears that currently, int[] image simply contains a bunch of
indices into the color palette (0-15), in left-to-right, top-to-bottom
order.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, it must also be able to read the screen:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   public byte[] read( Point a, Dimension d );
</I>&gt;<i>   public byte[] read( Point a, Point b );
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Blit and read are complementary, so that reading a region after blitting
</I>it
&gt;<i> should return the same image. Further discussion of AWT should be part of
</I>&gt;<i> the User Interface group, shouldn't it? The kernel/virtual machine might
</I>&gt;<i> plug in any implementation of AWT.
</I>
I think read should be almost as simple as a blit, considering the ease of
mapping the memory into a byte array.

It might be good to reawaken the UI group, considering it's had no
messages since September (about the time I started getting busy in school
:<i>).
