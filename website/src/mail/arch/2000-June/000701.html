It is unfortunate that I haven't been clear about the use of a &quot;proxy&quot;. I
assumed the system would &quot;hide&quot; the details of a proxy. An implicit proxy
would be presented to application programmers. Look at the implicit proxies
inside java.io and java.net. That kind of abstraction for application
programming is a good thing.

On the other hand, a shared-object subsystem has to deal with the proxy
explicitely. If we expand the Java Virtual Machine Specification to include
shared objects, we must re-write parts of it. I'd like to re-write as
little as possible. Implicit proxies must behave as much like the real
object as possible.

I believe that Bytecode Native Interface provides one part of a generic
mechanism for sharing system-wide objects. I believe the Smart API provides
a mechanism for identifying a shared object with a uniform resource
identifier.

In the Alt Package project, for example, I put together a design for
java.io that serves as an implicit proxy for system objects running on
another machine across the network. The java.io package in machine A
delegates its file subsystem to machine B. When A connects to B, machine B
isolates the file I/O for machine A to one of B's subdirectories. While I'm
not sure how practical that would be, it demonstrates that java.io is a
framework with many potential implementations, including one especially for
JOS.
