Hmm. I must think about this. Should we work exclusively on a
project-specific form of object sharing? I don't think so.

On the one hand, we are working on a research project. We'd like to have
answers to some very important object-sharing questions. And yet, a
project-specific mechanism for object sharing is one that might not be used
in an off-the-shelf virtual machine.

On the other hand, it seems as if we're so close to a breakthrough on what
can and cannot be shared among multiple bytecode processes.

Should object sharing be part of our brand new operating system? This is a
difficult question. What are our priorities? I believe we can develop a
genuine bytecode process with data sharing and nothing but data sharing.
Object sharing might be a luxury.

Because there is so much that is not known about it, object sharing might
be better left to the next version of JOS. JOS does not require object
sharing. There seem to be more important things to work on. We needed the
discussion of object sharing only to push forward the boundaries and
definition of a bytecode process.

Data sharing is adequate for the communication between processes, both
intra- and inter-virtual machine. How experimental should JOS be? How long
can JOS survive without a public release?

I would like to run JOS. I would like to switch all my production
applications over to JOS. By finishing the first version of JOS, we can
encourage a lot more participation and contribution to the JOS Project.
