&gt;<i> BootDisk, while immediately useful, is an exercise. It was designed for

Nope.  Java compilation by default optimizes for 'safety'.  If you have a
byte array, its an array (the object) of bytes.  Whether this is a good
idea or not is a judgement call.

&gt;<i> I do not intend to limit my application to Java 2. While I could put a

</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> a virtual machine compatible with the Java 0 Platform.
</I>
OK.  Well, then put it in the classpath or serve it via an httpd server.

&gt;<i> Sometimes, I wish Java were more of a system programming language, like
</I>&gt;<i> C/C++. I would like it to support porting from one version of Java to
</I>&gt;<i> another!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How are we going to write system programs for an operating system
</I>&gt;<i> without
</I>&gt;<i> support for binary data? Isn't the byte array one of the fundamental
</I>&gt;<i> constructs of programming?
</I>
Well, if you want to do systems programming in java, you need to write a
new extension to java and a special java compiler to handle it.  It
shouldn't be too big a stretch since its been done before with other
languages (but could be a good amount of work).

&gt;<i> CLASSPATH always available as a system property?
</I>
yes and no.  It doesn't have to be but it is for now.  its an
implementation detail I believe.  Once again, i could be wrong since I
don't have my spec with me.

&gt;<i> &gt;Nope.  You can jam the data into a constant String for the class or
</I>&gt;<i> hack
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the raw class file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I jammed the data into a constant String. I don't have access to a raw
</I>&gt;<i> class file in an off-the-shelf virtual machine.
</I>
Well, its not the virtual machine but rather a hex editor you need (even
nicer, a java class hex editor that understands proper java class file
format).

&gt;<i> &gt;The tool should be separate from the data.  You can distribute them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;together in the same jar but it doesn't seem to make much sense to
</I>&gt;<i> compile
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;it into the tool itself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While the tool should be separate from the data, a class loader is the
</I>&gt;<i> only
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism to load anything. When a class loader does not support
</I>&gt;<i> external
</I>&gt;<i> resources, separate data becomes a problem.
</I>
No.  Why not just use a File object.

&gt;<i> &gt;Won't you also need native methods to implement the actual disk writing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(rawwrite)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think so. On Linux, I am working under the assumption that
</I>&gt;<i> BootDisk
</I>&gt;<i> writes directly to /dev/fd0. It's like rawwrite.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On Windows, I am working under the assumption that BootDisk can invoke
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> external rawwrite program.
</I>
OK.  Essentially the same thing.  Just making sure you weren't hoping to
use just java to get the write done.  :)
