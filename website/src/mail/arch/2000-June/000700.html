view. We are building an operating system. I am working on this project as
a system programmer most of the time.

In order to maintain the illusion of shared objects for an application
programmer's point of view, a system programmer has to a lot of work. For a
system programmer, providing data sharing is relatively straight forward
and easy. Data sharing can be as simple as direct shared memory. While
that's easy for a system programmer to implement, it is &quot;hard&quot; for an
application programmer to use.

On the other hand, providing object sharing is complex. Interactions
between shared objects are often subtle and nonintuitive. Look at the
complexity of implementing a CORBA or RMI service. While that's difficult
for a system programmer to implement, it is &quot;easy&quot; for an application
programmer to use.

I've been talking from a system programmer's point of view on this mailing
list for as long as I can remember. This is a discussion about the
architecture of an operating system, isn't it? I am speaking as a system
programmer and always expect others to speak from the same point of view.

Let me clarify. When I speak of a &quot;proxy&quot;, I prefer implicit proxies from
the application programmer's point of view. I resort to explicit proxies
when writing an implementation of a subsystem. This always reminds me of
the FileInputStream and FileDescriptor object. On one hand, FileInputStream
is a implicit proxy for a foreign file input stream. Its fd property is a
FileDescriptor. In turn, a FileDescriptor object is an implicit proxy for a
foreign file handle. Its handle property is an explicit proxy. The real
file input stream is never owned by a virtual machine.

Likewise, it seems to me that a new bytecode proxy could handle the
standard in, out and err streams this way:

  public abstract void setStandardStreamHandles(
      int in,
      int out,
      int err );

Unfortunately, most implementations of java.lang.System /assume/ the
handles for standard in, out and err streams are always 0, 1 and 2. These
handles are provided automatically in a foreign machine code process.
Handles are turned into FileDescriptors. In turn, FileDescriptors are
turned into FileInputStream and FileOutputStream. If handles were passed as
formal parameters, we would be one step closer to a bytecode process.

Notice that is it far more complex to pass standard streams like this

  public abstract void setStandardStreams(
      FileDescriptor in,
      FileDescriptor out,
      FileDescriptor err );

or

  public abstract void setStandardStreams(
      FileInputStream in,
      FileOutputStream out,
      FileOutputStream err );

When given a handle, a subroutine can create a new FileDescriptor and
FileInputStream, like this:

  public setStandardInHandle( int v ) {
    in = new FileInputStream( FileDescriptor( v ) );
  }

When given a handle, a subroutine can create a new FileDescriptor and
FileOutputStream, like this:

  public setStandardOutHandle( int v ) {
    out = new FileOutputStream( FileDescriptor( v ) );
  }
  public setStandardErrHandle( int v ) {
    err = new FileOutputStream( FileDescriptor( v ) );
  }

This highlights the simplicity of passing handles between subsystems. The
interface only depends on a primative. It does not depend on a particular
plug-in version of java.io. The assignment of in, out and err is often
delayed. It takes a while for the system classes to load and static fields
to be assigned. A primative is easier to preserve through such a delay.

If files, devices and other system objects are assumed to be shared, we
have just come back to the original theme of sharing objects. We open an
shared object, use it and close it.

HANDLE open( const char *name );
void sendMessage( HANDLE v, const char *msg );
void close( HANDLE );

The system must keep track of which bytecode process has opened which
shared objects. Inside the open() subroutine, a shared object is added to a
process-specific open-object list. When a process is terminated, all shared
objects in this list are closed automatically by the operating system.

  forEach( HANDLE, close );

What is the &quot;name&quot; of a shared object? Each shared object is a digital
resource. It should follow the rules for uniform resource identifier.

In turn, a generic shared object proxy can be written in bytecode. It would
look something like this:

public final class SharedObject {
  public SharedObject( String name ) {
    handle = open( name );
  }
  public void sendMessage( String msg ) {
    sendMessage( handle, msg );
  }
  public void close() {
    close( handle );
  }
  public int handle;
}
