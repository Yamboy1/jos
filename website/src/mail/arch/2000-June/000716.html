<PRE>I am sure that a dynamic interface approach to object sharing is better
than otherwise. A dynamic interface approach goes something like this:

Process A creates object X. X is owned exclusively by process A.

Later, process B comes along and asks process A for object X. Of course,
process A doesn't want to give process B a direct object reference because
it wants to exclusively own object X. So what does process A do?

Process A uses some native method to create an interface for object X. The
native method /dynamically/ creates a class file and passes it and a
orthogonal handle to process B. Process B defines the interface by turning
a class file into a class. The class is owned exclusively by process B. In
turn, the interface class is turned into an object using the handle. The
interface class and handle are owned exclusively by process B.

-----

Every public method in the class of object X is added to the signature of
an interface. Therefore, methods are shared, never fields. It means that
any class can be shared at any time by any process. Obviously, beans are
easier to share.

Reflection on the dynamic interface will reveal all of the methods of the
original class. This shared method approach would eliminate the need to
compare class definitions to see if they are compatible. Every interface
that is created through this mechanism would be guaranteed to be
compatible...because when a thread &quot;virtuallly invokes&quot; an interface
method, the original method of the original class will be invoked. Since
the original method is invoked, there can be no casting errors.

When process A grants B access to X, process A returns a shared interface
definition. Later, because of the handle, process A can revoke access to X
without disturbing process B.

It would bother me to come up with a design that slows down non-shared
performance within a virtual machine. Although it might be functional, I do
not see how creating two objects (JavaObject and InstanceFields) for every
Java object would be effective.
