I applaud the idea of VM1 and VM2. VM1 provides a way to load and bind VM2
to a kernel and specific platform. While VM1 might be identical on every
platform, VM2 is a plug-in. It becomes application-specific. It can be
optimized for a particular application.

Are you working on the premise that VM1 is discarded when control is passed
to VM2? I assume VM1 is always loaded. My VM1 uses bytecode as a resource
so that a kernel, virtual machine and its core classes are statically
linked at link-time. The whole runtime image is loaded as a single &quot;file&quot;.
My preference is for VM1 to be a light-weight virtual machine (like JDK
1.02) and VM2 to be a heavy-weight virtual machine (like JDK 1.1 or 1.2 or
1.3).

The idea of VM1 and VM2 goes along with the distributed computing idea of
multiple &quot;domains&quot; where VM1 is the primary domain and VM2 is a secondary
domain. VM1 can load and compile multiple versions of VM2 without
rebooting. Thus it is possible for only one instance of VM1 but many
&quot;instances&quot; of VM2, giving us multiple bytecode processes in the classic
design. Once VM2 is fully compiled for a specific processor, it can be
reused for each bytecode process.

VM1 does not run custom Java applications. This greatly simplifies VM1. VM1
does not need to support the latest version of Java from Sun Microsystems.
VM1 does not need serialization. VM1 does not need JDBC (SQL). VM1 does not
need JFC/Swing. VM1 does not need support for Java Beans. These are things
that might be needed by VM2[].

I am working with a subset of Kore for VM1. I'm preserving java.lang,
java.util, java.io and java.net. With these classes, VM2 can be loaded and
compiled. With java.io, VM2 can be loaded from a local file subsystem. With
java.net, VM2 can be loaded from across the network.

By breaking apart VM1 and VM2, very good things happen. We enable our
operating system to be open-ended. We encourage multiple implementations of
VM2. It can support many Java platforms, now and in the future. We might
write VM2 in the Java programming language so that JOS becomes
self-hosting. The JIT compiler for VM1 is simpler because it always uses
the same Java platform.

Machine code can be embedded in a class file as a method attribute. The
name of the attribute would be &quot;xxxMachineCode&quot;, where xxx is a
platform/processor. The javac tool should recognize the asm keyword, like
this:

  public native void example() {
    asm {
      mov ax, dx
      :
    }
  }

or cpp keyword, like this:

  public native void example() {
    cpp {
      *t = *s;
      :
    }
  }
