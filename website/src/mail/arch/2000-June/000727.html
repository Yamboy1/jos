the most impressive (no matter what's going on under the covers) 
so a GUI is definitely a killer feature we should at least be thinking

Yes.  Because then we can have a 'signature' JOS look and feel.

We can't (it would be difficult).  The memory manager would need 
to be written at this point (otherwise, you'll end up writing it into the 
GUI code anyhow so might as well make it generic).

Actually I was wondering if we couldn't build it on the Java2D 
foundations (use its method of breaking up the graphics tasks).  If 
you implement Java2D you have all the tools (masking, fills, 
shapes, fonts, etc) to build any gui you like.

Of course I'm pulling a lot of this out of the air since I haven't really 
examined the Java2D api in depth.
