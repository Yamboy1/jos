<PRE>&gt;<i>  We had, at one point (with the old decaf), a functional virtual
</I>&gt;<i> console system, one console of which was (IIRC) 640x480x16 VGA.  It was,
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately, glacially slow, especially in mode-switching.
</I>
I'm not expecting any kind of decent performance, only functionality.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  There's no particular reason to start work on the AWT at the
</I>&gt;<i> VGA driver level, however.  If nothing else, we'll probably need h/w
</I>&gt;<i> acceleration to make things run quickly enough to be useful for a good bit
</I>&gt;<i> of time.  (e.g. optimize the interpreter/implement JIT
</I>&gt;<i> compiling)  Furthermore, you may want to consider writing the back-end as
</I>&gt;<i> a vector package, a-la OSX.  (Not sure if there's a Java standard (java
</I>&gt;<i> 2d?) for this yet.)  Basically, you ought to be able to fake a
</I>&gt;<i> frame-buffer fairly easily, and try different ideas with that on a normal
</I>&gt;<i> JVM, possibly with help from rheise.os if/when you need an AWT
</I>&gt;<i> (peer(s)) process.
</I>
I'm not positive about this, but doesn't the VGA standard automatically
provide one backbuffer (bank)?  I agree that hardware acceleration is
needed, either through native drivers or JIT, but I figure that something
is better than nothing (as I said before).  In the far future, it may be
necessary to implement AWT in mostly native code, just for performance
reasons.  This kind of shoots down our idea of Java-based drivers, but
there may be a compromise solution somewhere.  Anyway, I just thought of
working on an AWT because it's what interests me, and it's something
that's (hopefully) not too far in the future anyway.
