<PRE>Inside bytecode as a resource, I have been working exclusively with Kore.
Kore is compatible with &quot;Java 0&quot; platform, as demonstrated by Sun
Microsystems' JDK 1.02. When I heard of KaffeOS, it got me thinking. Is
there a KoreOS? or DecafOS? or ClasspathOS?

A virtual machine written in C++ could be version-less, compatible with
Kore, Kaffe and Classpath. By recompiling and relinking, our team could
produce more than one version of an operating system.

This is where the research of the JOS Project should shine. If anyone wants
to turn their virtual machine into an operating system, they should benefit
from the techniques we might develop.

Doesn't everyone have the same challenge booting up a virtual machine?
Doesn't everyone have the same challenge for boot packages? bytecode cache?
and bytecode verification? Doesn't everyone have the same challenge of
regression testing? I'd like to think so.

All boot the same way. All have the same boot package names. All interpret
bytecode. All share the class file format for executable images.
