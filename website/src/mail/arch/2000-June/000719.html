JOSCore is probably a issue of distribution, rather than namespace. How
much must be distributed in order to say that it is JOS? or JOS-compatible?

Very little is absolutely required. A file subsystem is not required. A
protocol stack is not required. Process management is not required. A
kernel and virtual machine, linked together statically, might be a
JOS-compatible operating system.

JOS is a computer operating system, not limited to a IBM PC-compatible
computer. Why? Because JOS is so scaleable that, at the small end, it can
fit in ROM on an embedded or consumer device. It can fit inside a IDE, SCSI
or CD-ROM drive. It can fit inside a 104-key keyboard, a monitor or mouse.
It can fit in a cell phone. It can fit inside ISA, PCI or PCMCIA card. JOS
can be small enough that an entire TCP/IP protocol stack can be implemented
/inside/ of a network interface card. The smallest JOS enables programmers
to write their smallest devices in a processor-independent way.

1. None of these consumer devices need a file subsystem.

2. JOS is ROM-able; classes that are used in a specific application should
be added to a ROM image.

JOS is so scaleable that, at the big end, it can fit inside a personal
computer, mini-computer, mainframe or supercomputer. It can fit inside a
server farm or computer cluster.

JOSystem is a kernel and virtual machine. A virtual machine on the low end
is functionally equivalent to a virtual machine on the high end. Of course,
a virtual machine on the high end might have greater optimization and
virtual memory management.

&gt;<i>Does JOSCore needs the Java API, or the JAva API needs JOSCore?
</I>
JOSCore does not depend on the Java API; Java API does not depend JOSCore.
JOSCore is a concern when distributing JOSystem. We encourage you to
distribute only the packages an application uses. When an application
requires the entire Java 2 standard class library, distribute the entire
Java 2 standard class library. You might put the entire Java API and
JOSCore into your distribution. When your application requires only a few
packages from the Java 0 standard class library, distribute only the
packages it uses. You might put java.lang, java.util and java.io and
JOSCore into your distribution.

I wish I had concrete examples to use. It might be easier to understand
with examples taken from experience. JOS is going to be a little confusing
and uncertain until someone implements a consumer device. Except, I don't
know of any consumer device that uses the JOS architecture.

&gt;<i>I mean how can you program JOSCore in Java, if you can't use the API?
</I>
A team of programmers have been working on JOS for a few years. They write
programs using off-the-shelf virtual machines from a variety of vendors. In
the experimental programs that have been written, programmers use
everything from the Java API. These experimental programs are not yet
concerned with the real cost to a consumer device of using a class from an
non-essential API.

If you have a project with a a 34MB ROM image and 32MB or 64MB ROMs, you
might like to know if you could eliminate any non-essential classes from
your ROM image. If you find a package that you really do not have to
include, you can remove it and ship with 32MB ROMs. (Assuming 32MB ROMs are
less expensive than 64MB ROMs.)

&gt;<i>Can you produce bytecode without the Java API?
</I>
When you write your own virtual machine, you can do anything. In theory,
you /can/ produce bytecode without the Java API. The Java API is not
required at &quot;compile-time&quot;. Bytecode can be assembled with a Java assembler
like Jasmin.

In theory, you can create more special-case objects like java.lang.Object.
In the Alt Package project, I've been working on alt.lang.Object as a new
anchor for alternative packages. If I write a virtual machine, it does not
have to be compatible with the Java Virtual Machine Specification.

In practice, this is a research project. It helps clarify what can and
cannot be done in a Java Virtual Machine. When you write a Java Virtual
Machine, you must follow one of the Java Virtual Machine Specifications.

The JOS Project aims to implement the Java Virtual Machine Specification as
much as possible. We want to build a host for standard Java applications.
We must extend the specification where it does not provide for things we
need, like a bytecode native interface and multiple primordial class
loaders. Being practical, we would like very much to extend the
specification a little as possible.

&gt;<i>It's just a little confusing...
</I>
Yes, it is confusing. JOSystem and JOSBox should be revisited in the
architecture discussion.

&gt;<i>So you also don't need JOSExtensions (they are superfulous). But what
</I>&gt;<i>could be in Extensions? Maybe a web server? Or is such an application
</I>&gt;<i>running on top of the Java API, as a user program?
</I>
JOS extensions might include a file subsystem, protocol stack, process
manager and things like these. Likely, a web server is an application, not
an extension. A device manager might be an extension, too.

&gt;<i>And JOSCore is not org.jos.core.*, but org.jos.core.* is in JOSCore, isn't
</I>&gt;<i>it? Can a service run on JOSCore (just bytecode) w/o the Java API?
</I>
No, JOSCore is not org.jos.core. It is unfortunate that two completely
different things were accidentally given similar names. For a while, I
mistakenly thought they were the same. They sound the same, don't they?

JOSCore is not limited to a single package. Meanwhile, org.jos.core
namespace should not be reused.

&gt;<i>Why do you compare the JOSCore (or org.jos.core.*) to sun.* or
</I>&gt;<i>netscape.*. I thing these are just some libraries, writen as JNI,to serve
</I>&gt;<i>the Java API of Sun / Netscape. But they are writen in C / C++, and are
</I>&gt;<i>native code, not bytecode. How do you thing, you can create something in
</I>&gt;<i>bytecode to serve the JOS Java API? Or better, I can thing of JOSCore
</I>&gt;<i>being in bytecode, but _HOW_ do you create this bytecode (tell me a java
</I>&gt;<i>program to produce bytecode without using a 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>class yzx {
</I>&gt;<i>} 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>statment. Since Class is a subclass of Object, and Object is defined in
</I>&gt;<i>the Java API, how can you program the JOSCore without the java API?
</I>
Today, I am working on the assumption that java.lang, java.util, java.io
and java.net are statically linked to a virtual machine. Instead of adding
these boot packages to an archive file, such as classes.zip or rt.jar, they
are part of the virtual machine executable image.

The rest of the JOS/Java API is a radically different matter. From this I
mean that I split the Java standard class libraries into two parts: boot
and system packages. Boot packages depend on the virtual machine. The JOS
platform API depends on boot packages. JOS applications depend on JOS API
and boot packages. The Java standard class library depends on JOS API and
boot packages. Java applications depend on the Java standard class library.

Since boot packages includes java.lang, there doesn't seem to be a problem.

Sun Microsystems' definition of &quot;core&quot; packages does not coincide with
mine. Sun puts a lot of unnecessary stuff in the &quot;core&quot; packages. They have
turned Java 2 into an exclusively server-side platform.

Even something as popular as a file subsystem is unnecessary on a consumer
device. A file subsystem is optional. If a file subsystem is implemented in
a JOS machine, it must be compatible with the JOS Platform API. If it is
not implemented, it does not have to be (re)distributed.
