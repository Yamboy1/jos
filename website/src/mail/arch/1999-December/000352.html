<PRE>I believe that most of the source code from the Classpath Project can be
salvaged. A program can be written to change the namespace of all those
classes to what it should be (and should have been). The C++ code is
greatly affected because java_awt_peer_gjt..() would become
org_classpath_peer_gjt..().

And yet, most of the translation is one-for-one. In theory, it can be
mapped and automated. If the Classpath Project is unwilling or unable to do
this, the JOS Project should do it. Everything in JOS hinges on a cleanroom
implementation of the Java class libraries.

We might not be able to wait for Classpath to provide something appropriate
for JOS. We need to contact their organizers and let them know how much
we're counting on perfect compatibility with Java 2 Platform.

If the download from CVS is a preview of the things to come, we cannot
reach the Java 2 Platform based on Classpath. Classpath needs to change
their direction or we need to come up with anotehr plan. I analysed
anonymous Java source code from the Classpath Project
&lt;URL:<A HREF="http://www.classpath.org/">http://www.classpath.org/</A>&gt;.

1. Contributors are using java.* packages for their own personal extension
to the Java class libraries. While they have good ideas about the strengths
and weaknesses of Sun Microsystems' API, they cross the line when adding
and subtracting whimsically from the specification.

2. Contributors have expressed their contempt for the deprecated methods
and have not implemented them in Java 2 Platform. While I sympathize, I
cannot agreed.

3. I expected to find code in the org.classpath namespace. Instead of using
the org.classpath namespace, contributors have put their code inside java.*
or the default package.

4. Much of the effort cannot be reused in an off-the-shelf virtual machine
from Sun Microsystems or others.

5. The Classpath Project has not solved the puzzle of JVM-specific classes
or native methods. Instead, they have added JVM-specific classes to the
java.* namespace.

Here is my proposal. We need a liason between JOS and Classpath. In order
for us to reuse the software created by the Classpath Project, it must be
perfectly compatible with the Java specification or it must not be added to
the java.* namespace.

A. It is perfectly legal -- it breaks no technical rule -- if contributors
create class libraries that do not match the Java specification. If so,
they use their own namespace, like this:

org.classpath.applet
org.classpath.awt
org.classpath.awt.peer
org.classpath.awt.peer.gtk
org.classpath.io
org.classpath.lang
org.classpath.net
org.classpath.util

B. JOS and Classpath Projects must work together in a methodical and
positive manner so that JOS might benefit from Classpath. The JOS Project
should be able to share the Bytecode Native Interface (BCNI) and build
perfectly compatible Java class libraries from the functionality found in
Classpath.
