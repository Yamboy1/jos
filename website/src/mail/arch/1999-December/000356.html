If you've got a server farm, you need a new operating system. If you have
many processors and only one console (monitor-keyboard-mouse), you need a
new way of thinking about the human interaction with this machine. The
human must operate this machine, the whole machine. Traditional operating
systems are tied to a obsolete single processor/single console model. You
simply cannot run a traditional operating system efficiently on a server farm.

Yes, you should be able to group them arbitrary ways. I would prefer a
classic approach to grouping, like agent and cluster technology. Java
agents are the first to be platform-independent enough to roam from one
machine to the next.

A new OS must be more platform independent so that agents can roam without
concern for the foreign operating system. It is possible to maintain a mix
of JOS, Linux and Windows on a server farm. I am free to use one copy of
Windows 95 for my console and use Linux for my servers. I would like to use
JOS, too.

After forming a reply, I wonder if your definition of &quot;parallel&quot; processing
is the same as mine. Parallel processing is where one program is running,
with only one &quot;thread of control&quot;, and parts of the program are
automatically divided among more than one processor on a motherboard. A
network is not part of this kind of parallel processing.

What is distributed processing anyway? The Internet is one of the best
examples of successful distributed processing in the software industry. The
model is simple. All the work gets done. Each machines perform their own
dedicated task. Many machines contribute to the processing power of the
network.

-----

A server-farm-in-a-box does not need to be fancy. It does not need its
software to do much beyond what has already been done. The first step is to
organize the hardware in an off-the-shelf package so that it out performs
the value of buying one processor at a time. Imagine the economy of scale
when you can buy a four or sixteen unit motherboard. Only sixteen
motherboards are needed to make a 256 unit server farm.

Second, I would like to see JOS as the operating system of choice. Why?
Because only a bytecode-based operating system can provide a single
&quot;executable image&quot; for all 256 machines.

Third, I would like to have an agent environment available for some of
those processors. I would prefer using the successful &quot;agent&quot; and &quot;cluster&quot;
technologies, rather than parallel processing.

I cannot turn the administration of my server farm over to a machine. I
cannot justify automatic load-balancing across all 256 processors. A few of
these machines can be used as if they were one, using &quot;cluster&quot; technology.
Agents are free to roam from one machine in a cluster to another.

In general, people must choose to set up specific services on specific
machines. That's what a network engineer does. When I look at the
successful model used throughout the Internet/intranet network, I see
people getting involved in configuring their own network. I get involved in
configuring my server farm. I have given each machine in my server farm a
unique name.

The entire server farm is a domain. Each machine in the domain has a unique
name.

quest: This machine is also known as www and ftp. I set aside quest as a
&quot;security&quot; server. It runs Linux, BOOTP, TFTP, TELNET, FTP, HTTP, SMB
(master). 

world: I set aside world to be a very-large-disk file server. It runs
Linux, SMB, TELNET, FTP and that's it.

josx: I set aside the next machine to be an experimental JOS machine.

Each machine can be dedicated to SMTP, print service, file service, backup
services, CORBA services, RMI services, XDC services and more.

-----

While one server-farm-in-a-box might be configured to the max, an entry
level server-farm-in-a-box might come with only one CPU pre-installed.

Each motherboard uses as many CPUs as you have installed. If the CPU &quot;slot&quot;
is empty, the unit is disabled somehow. A sixteen unit motherboard does not
have to include sixteen CPUs all at one time. Instead, you buy them as you
need them. Rather than buying all 256 CPUs at one time, you can buy a few
CPUs each year until you have collected the whole set.
