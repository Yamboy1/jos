Sounds reasonable.  I'm a bit concerned with our use of the 1x 
versioning because it seems to imply that we're actually at a 1.x 
stage (post major release).  When in reality we're more in a &quot;.01x 
release&quot; or &quot;1.0 pre-alpha x release&quot; stage...  Just something to 
consider.

I like these requirements.  Actually, I think a binary only release at 
this time should only require the following:

ibm pc compatible 386 or higher
4mb ram (or was it 8?)
keyboard
vga video
3.5&quot; floppy drive
Access to a disk image program like rawwrite.

The binary release at this point is a single rawwrite compatible 
image file (what's the equivilent image copier on unix?).  You 
download the image, use rawwrite to blast it onto a floppy, boot the 
floppy and see the tests run, the video stressed, and allow any 
user input you want (test the keyboard, maybe provide a menu 
driven set of options like running optional (potentially fatal) tests 
like perhaps a rudimentary tcpip stack or ethernet driver, etc).  
That's it.  Just a quick demo that it boots on a wide range of 
machines, it does stuff, and we can distribute a bootable copy that 
anyone can use.

This will give us experience with the kernel on multiple machines, 
workout some distribution issues, and see about integrating GRUB 
and the kernel and building bootable floppy disk images.
