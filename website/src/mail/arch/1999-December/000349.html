</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I'm a bit concerned with our use of the 1x versioning because it seems to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;reality we're more in a &quot;.01x release&quot; or &quot;1.0 pre-alpha x release&quot; stage...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Just something to consider.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Attention: Everyone in the distribution group should consider the
</I>&gt;<i> implications of 1x versioning. We need some naming convention to make it
</I>&gt;<i> unmistake-able that one distribution came after another. I suggested &quot;JOS
</I>&gt;<i> Distribution 1e&quot; because it comes after &quot;JOS Distribution 1d&quot;.
</I>
Yes.  Since the previous was 1d, 1e seems the logical next 
choice.  That wasn't really my problem with the name.

&gt;<i> The world of software is changing. The version number for a distribution
</I>&gt;<i> explains the order in which distributions -- not programs -- were made. You
</I>&gt;<i> have to look inside a distribution to see which program versions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I look to Linux distribution as an example. SuSE Linux Distribution 6.0 has
</I>&gt;<i> a 2.x Linux kernel. SuSE started with Linux Distribution 1.0 as their first
</I>&gt;<i> distribution. From what I understand of distribution numbers, the first
</I>&gt;<i> distribution of an &quot;0.001&quot; product is still distribution 1.
</I>
Yeah.  But my problem is that distribution 1 would imply to me that 
its got something that runs in it.  Now I know that there are 
programs in it that do run in any jvm, but since its a &quot;JOS&quot; 
distribution and not a &quot;JOS Application&quot; distribution, I would 
assume that its really a dist centered around an OS.  I'd hate to 
see us get all the way to say distribution 12m before we're shipping 
something that resembles a running, usable OS.  Just naming 
wise, it seems weird.

&gt;<i> JOS has the greatest potential of any operating system yet devised to reach
</I>&gt;<i> the mass market of non-technical people. The mass-market would appreciate
</I>&gt;<i> it if we, like them, used 1 as the first distribution. Only programmers
</I>&gt;<i> start counting at zero. Programmers make up such a small percentage of the
</I>&gt;<i> total population of JOS target market. While we have to impress programmers
</I>&gt;<i> more than any other market segment, we should be concerned with the total
</I>&gt;<i> market when selecting a distribution name.
</I>
Yes.  And so, since this is a programmers only release, we should 
stress it with a 0 release....

&gt;<i> Something as complex as an operating system has no chance at all of
</I>&gt;<i> settling on a version number for the whole OS. We should not confuse the
</I>&gt;<i> version of a distribution with things like the version of any kernel or the
</I>&gt;<i> version of any Java virtual machine.
</I>
Agreed.
 
&gt;<i> The issue of significant difference is under discussion. While I think the
</I>&gt;<i> difference is not significant enough to call it &quot;JOS Distribution 2&quot;, you
</I>&gt;<i> might disagree. Maybe it would be simpler to call it &quot;JOS Distribution 2&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> since it might be the first distribution that boots from BOOTP/TFTP and
</I>&gt;<i> GRUB. Is that a significant difference?
</I>
I would consider it a pretty big difference that the earlier dist was 
source and required building software to get things going.  This one 
would include a bootable disk image that only requires a simply 
image copy tool to get going.  If not a 2x release, at least a 1.1a 
release... or is 1.1a before 1b... do you count 1a 1.1a 1.2a 1.3a... 
1b 1.1b 1.2b or is there no minor versions allowed?

&gt;<i> The operating system as a whole needs no number. Parts of an operating
</I>&gt;<i> system are individually numbered. The distribution is individually
</I>&gt;<i> numbered. The architecture or platform API is individually numbered. I feel
</I>&gt;<i> strongly that JOS itself should not be given a version number in the style
</I>&gt;<i> and consequence of, say, &quot;Windows 95&quot;.
</I>
Agreed.  The os itself should be traditionally numbered 1.0 1.1 
1.1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 2.0, etc.

&gt;<i> A name like &quot;Windows 95&quot; sounds like it is obsolete in 1996. It feels old
</I>
Yes, but for _distributions_, it might actually be a good system.  
Whether the os revs or not, you'll want to be using a recent 
_distribution_ and using year number as part of the system would 
make sense... even months.  I imagine that patches, security 
fixes, and new tools should be frequent enough to warrant at least 
a yearly update no matter what.  And a monthly update doesn't 
seem ridiculous.  Most of the dist stays the same of course, but 
the patches etc can be bundled up on a regular basis and added to 
the dist.  Wouldn't it be easy to remember if you need to get the 
latest dist if its name was &quot;JOS Distribution 2000, October release 
(featuring the JOS 1.3 Kernel)&quot; and it was October 2000?  And 
when someone asks for support and say they've got a version 
number that's &quot;JOS 2000, July release&quot; and its now Jan 2001... 
you know exactly (without having to know anything about what's 
the current arbitrary distribution number) how far out of date you are.

&gt;<i> As I think about it, a serial number for distributions could be
</I>&gt;<i> accomplished in a number of different ways. Personally, I like &quot;1e&quot; (and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;2a&quot;) because it is different, just as JOS is different. &quot;1e&quot; is easy to
</I>&gt;<i> remember, write down and pronounce (or enunciate) over the phone.
</I>
Agreed.  But for a distribution, its also easy to say &quot;JOS 99, 
November release&quot; and something like jos_1999_nov.jar is pretty 
intuitive and conveys more information than just what particular 
distribution you're talking about (it also has an implicit date).

Of course, it must be stressed that this is a distribution 
designation, and not a version number for any particular product 
that is part of that distribution.

Just something to think about.
