Attention: Everyone in the distribution group should consider the
implications of 1x versioning. We need some naming convention to make it
unmistake-able that one distribution came after another. I suggested &quot;JOS
Distribution 1e&quot; because it comes after &quot;JOS Distribution 1d&quot;.

The world of software is changing. The version number for a distribution
explains the order in which distributions -- not programs -- were made. You
have to look inside a distribution to see which program versions.

I look to Linux distribution as an example. SuSE Linux Distribution 6.0 has
a 2.x Linux kernel. SuSE started with Linux Distribution 1.0 as their first
distribution. From what I understand of distribution numbers, the first
distribution of an &quot;0.001&quot; product is still distribution 1.

JOS has the greatest potential of any operating system yet devised to reach
the mass market of non-technical people. The mass-market would appreciate
it if we, like them, used 1 as the first distribution. Only programmers
start counting at zero. Programmers make up such a small percentage of the
total population of JOS target market. While we have to impress programmers
more than any other market segment, we should be concerned with the total
market when selecting a distribution name.

From my informal survey, my customers have responded favorably to &quot;joss&quot;
for an operating system name. It reminds them of &quot;doss&quot;. And sense &quot;j&quot;
comes after &quot;d&quot;, they thing &quot;joss&quot; might be an improvement. People
&quot;correct&quot; me when I pronounced &quot;JOS&quot; like &quot;jay-oss&quot; or &quot;jay-oh-ess&quot;.

Something as complex as an operating system has no chance at all of
settling on a version number for the whole OS. We should not confuse the
version of a distribution with things like the version of any kernel or the
version of any Java virtual machine.

Furthermore, The significance of version &quot;1.0&quot; has been abused and lost to
a new generation of customers. Some vendors, aware of the stigma of version
&quot;1.0&quot; have adopted a insane policy. They use version &quot;2.0&quot; for their first
version of a product.

The issue of significant difference is under discussion. While I think the
difference is not significant enough to call it &quot;JOS Distribution 2&quot;, you
might disagree. Maybe it would be simpler to call it &quot;JOS Distribution 2&quot;,
since it might be the first distribution that boots from BOOTP/TFTP and
GRUB. Is that a significant difference?

The operating system as a whole needs no number. Parts of an operating
system are individually numbered. The distribution is individually
numbered. The architecture or platform API is individually numbered. I feel
strongly that JOS itself should not be given a version number in the style
and consequence of, say, &quot;Windows 95&quot;.

People want to have their operating system last longer than the
applications they build on top of it. Using a &quot;model year&quot; for software in
the style of the automobile industry is just plain dumb. It wouldn't even
work if you *could* produce a brand new operating system every year. It
sends the wrong message to create an operating system that's guaranteed to
be obsolete by this time next year.

A name like &quot;Windows 95&quot; sounds like it is obsolete in 1996. It feels old
in 1997. It feels embarrasing in 1998. Microsoft made a marketing mistake
on the scale of New Coke. Who will want to install a product called
&quot;Windows 2000&quot; in the year 2000, 2001, 2002, etc. That reminds people of
something they don't want to be reminded of: low quality software has
obsolesence built in. Only high quality software is built to last.

As I think about it, a serial number for distributions could be
accomplished in a number of different ways. Personally, I like &quot;1e&quot; (and
&quot;2a&quot;) because it is different, just as JOS is different. &quot;1e&quot; is easy to
remember, write down and pronounce (or enunciate) over the phone.

- a number from 1 to n
- a letter from a to z
