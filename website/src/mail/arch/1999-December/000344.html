<PRE>Let's think about the next distribution of JOS.

When the kernel group reaches a concensus that jJOS is GRUB-bootable, it
gives us an opportunity to create the next distribution of JOS.

Is it a major new release? I don't think so. I think we might call it &quot;1e&quot;,
as in

&quot;Announcing JOS Distribution 1e&quot;

We should distribute a runtime-only version, where someone can download JOS
and boot it with the minimum of fuss.

1. Like the binary distribution of JOS 1d, a runtime-only distribution must
not require a Linux compiler.

2. If JOS is GRUB-bootable, we should emphasize a step-by-step description
of booting up JOS with GRUB.

3. A GRUB-bootable version does not require a network interface card (does
it?). So, requirements for a &quot;JOS machine&quot; should eliminate a network
interface card.

We should plan ahead for what we consider to be &quot;in&quot; vs. &quot;out&quot; for this
release. While the experimental TCP/IP stuff needs to be distributed, it
might not make it into a runtime-only distribution. It goes into a
source-only distribution.

We also need to refine the definition of a technical distribution. A
technical distribution requires Linux (doesn't it?). A technical
distribution includes tools (or links to tools) so that you can (re)build
the JOS runtime distribution from the JOS source distribution. Are there
new tools required to build JOS? The tools.tgz archive does not include
GRUB and other tools recently mentioned by the kernel group. And yet, a
GRUB-bootable runtime edition needs something from GRUB.

Your comments would be appreciated.
