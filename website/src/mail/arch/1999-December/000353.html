<PRE>I have completed a runtime (binary), source and technical distribution of
Smart API - Release 2a - Distribution 5. For more information, see also the
JOSDistribution1d page on JOS Wiki.

Distribution 5 includes Application Studio - Release 2a (in other words,
the org.jos.gchii.appstudio2a package). Inside the Application Studio is an
ExitFrame, a AWT-compatible frame with an Exit property. When exit is true,
closing the frame calls System.exit().

It also contains GUIAppication, an AWT-compatible frame that implements the
Program interface (org.jos.program2a.Program). Any extension of
GUIApplication is immediately compatible with the Program Browser.

For example, I created a DericApplication class. DericApplication extends
GUIApplication. I can start the Deric application using this URI:

run:program:org.jos.gchii.deric1c.DericApplication

What more could you want? Because the Program interface is an interface,
you can easily create a Swing-compatible frame available from the Program
Browser.

About the Desktop Browser

It might not be clear in the documentation...but the Desktop Browser is
functional in distributions 4 and 5. The Desktop Browser enables you to
click an icon instead of manually typing a URI. Since the desktop browser
implements the desktop: scheme, desktop files can be loaded and linked like
HTML pages.

-----

About the future

I expect multiple, concurrent desktops and server-farm-in-a-box to be the
&quot;norm&quot; in the future. When you buy a &quot;computer&quot; for your office, you won't
buy one CPU with one desktop. You'll buy a box the size of a PC; but, it
won't be the PC you're used to. It might have 256 hacked PCs inside. A
server-farm-in-a-box contains a TCP/IP subnet:

 - 256 swappable units
 - Each unit has at least one CPU and a network interface card.
 - Each unit uses BOOTP/TFTP to boot from a single JOS boot image.
 - Each unit only executes mostly-bytecode applications.
 - Packages are downloaded on-demand through HTTP using package files.
 - Only one unit &quot;needs&quot; a video adapter, a second network interface card,
a keyboard and mouse.

A server-farm-in-a-box needs a new kind of operating system (like JOS) in
order to bring the power of many general purpose computers together with
one version of the executable bytecode.

When you operate such a computer, you need multiple, concurrent desktops.
You should have at least one desktop for each unit. Visually, you open the
desktop for a unit in order to invoke applications on that unit.
