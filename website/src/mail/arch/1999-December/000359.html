You are representative of all kinds of people. You manage 8 machines. You
get involved in configuring and optimizing those eight machines. And yet,
you only have one keyboard/mouse/monitor.

In an evolutionary first step, I would like you to continue doing what you
are already doing. Even with 8 machines were in the next room, it is easier
to maintain them with one keyboard/mouse/monitor.

From my viewpoint, a server-farm-in-a-box must never be a 16-way cluster of
16-way SMPs. By my definition, a 16-CPU SMP would only be one &quot;unit&quot;.

Units always use a network interface card for inter-machine communication
-- just like all other serverfarms. Each unit in a serverfarm-in-a-box must
be a wholy independent general purpose processor, like a PC. It never uses
&quot;shared memory&quot; to communicate between processors.

You have 8 machines that are 250 miles away. Are all 8 machine in the same
server closet? Are all 8 in close physical proximity?

Imagine I have 8 machines in a room next door. Why do these 8 machines need
8 separate power supplies. Why do they need 8 separate cases? Why did I
need to purchase 8 separate motherboards, with one CPU on each motherboard?

A serverfarm-in-a-box is useful if I would normally go out and buy eight
(or more) separate PCs and put them together in a serverfarm. I would buy
one case, with one power supply. I could buy all 8 PCs at once, one box,
one transaction.

Between these 8 machines, I would have no network cabling exposed. By
optimizing such a design, I could eliminate the need for 8 separate
&quot;motherboards&quot;. Optimization would combine 8 PCs on single card, while
maintaining indepdendence.

It might be possible to engineer &quot;network interface cards&quot; for a
serverfarm-in-a-box that does not physically have an ethernet cable.
Network interface cards can be integrated into the motherboard.

-----

With one computer, I am always waiting. I type in a command to recompile
something like the source code from Source Server. Then I have to wait for
what seems like an eternity to type in the next command. My computer is
never fast enough to do all the things I want to do. Programmers use
computers, too.

I want a hardware architecture that frees us from the idea that speed comes
from faster and faster CPUs. The Internet is proof that large scale
distributed processing is possible with &quot;slow&quot; CPUs. A serverfarm-in-a-box
takes the successful model of the Internet and brings it &quot;home&quot; to a small
or medium sized office. Where else can hardware manufacturers go?

I believe the only &quot;thing&quot; missing from a serverfarm-in-a-box is a suitable
operating system. None of these other &quot;stand-alone&quot; operating systems will
do because they are not scaleable.

-----

I have experimented with &quot;agents&quot; in my lab. An agent cooperates with its
agent environment to move around from one agent environment to another.
Typically, an agent is serialized on one agent environment and deserialized
on another.

On a single machine, I can have two agent environments, each in its own
process, connected by TCP/IP. Through a priority scheme, I designed an
agent that changes its own priority. The &quot;high priority&quot; environment has
one and only one agent running at a time. The &quot;low priority&quot; environment
has more than one agent running, each in its own thread. A change in
priority might cause the agent environment to &quot;move&quot; it to the other
environment.
