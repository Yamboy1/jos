Point 3 is a procedural issue. Understanding this point is critical to the
success of any cleanroom implementation of Java class libraries. Building
classes directly in the java.* namespace has always been the obvious thing
to do and yet it has never worked. Design, develop and debug Java class
libraries requires an alternative namespace.

Think about how Sun Microsystems did it. It is no secret. They used JDK 0.0
(Oak) to develop the class libraries for JDK 1.0. They use JDK 1.0 to
develop the class libraries for JDK 1.1. They used JDK 1.1 to develop the
class libraries for JDK 1.2. The alternative namespace at Sun Microsystems
is javax.*. The original purpose of the javax.* namespace comes from the
need to develop classes for a new virtual machine using an old one. 

There is a very good reason why I expected to find code in the
org.classpath namespace. Sun Microsystems &quot;owns&quot; the java.*, javax.*, sun.*
and com.sun.* namespaces. No organization should put new designs there. The
strengths and weakness of Sun Microsystems' namespaces is theirs and theirs
alone.

 - According to cleanroom rules, we can put exactly the same design in
java.* and javax.*. We must match a specification exactly. We can put new
design in org.classpath (or org.jos). Sun Microsystems has made it clear
that we cannot put anything in sun.* or com.sun.*.

An alternative namespace is required for the design, development and
debugging of the original bytecode. So, where did the java.* libraries come
from? At the &quot;last minute&quot;, the source code for the alternative namespace
is copied to java.* and compiled. At the time the Java class libraries are
compiled, they have already been thoroughly tested.

What are the implications? It means that you can write a class called
alt.io.ByteArrayInputStream and test it immediately in any JDK. You can run
down a check list to make certain your awt.io.ByteArrayInputStream matches
the specification of java.io.ByteArrayInputStream. You have two classes
side-by-side that you can systematically compare, feature for feature.

While a test program is written to test a class alternative namespace, it
can depend on existing, fully debugged and reliable classes in the java.*
namespace. When you write a test program framework, you're free to use any
and all existing classes. By using an existing JDK, you have a reliable
virtual machine to run on.

&gt;&gt;<i> 4. Much of the effort cannot be reused in an off-the-shelf virtual machine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from Sun Microsystems or others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	Unfortunately, I think this will be true for any class
</I>&gt;<i>library.  The phrase 'class library' is misleading in a way that suggests
</I>&gt;<i>it's not an integral part of the VM; it doesn't (AFAIK) /have/ to be, but
</I>&gt;<i>Sun seems to have designed it that way.
</I>
Developing classes in an alternative namespace has many advantages. One
advantage is the reuse of the class library immediately in any
off-the-shelf virtual machine. It is not at all necessary to wait until the
alternative class libraries have been copied into java.* namespace. They
are immediately available for use in any application.

I use 'class library' to mean any class library. A class library is a
collection of classes. In Java-speak, a class library is a &quot;package&quot;. The
Java class libraries are found in java.* namespace.

A class library is not an integral part of the virtual machine. From a
purely technical viewpoint, few classes in the Java class libraries are an
integral part of a virtual machine.

Most of the class libraries in Java 2 Platform are not integral to the
virtual machine. I call them class libraries because most class libraries
are optional. There are only a few, like java.lang, that put &quot;Java&quot; in
&quot;Java Virtual Machine&quot;.

I do not wish to misrepresent bytecode technologies. I want people to
understand that too many of Sun's products have been coerced into the Java
2 Platofrm when, in fact, they are optional. You can run a bytecode virtual
machine without them.

Adding things to the java.* packages that are not an integral part of the
virtual machine undermines competition. Sun Microsystems does not worry
about competition on JDBC and Swing. They threw it into the core to
discourage innovation and competition. While it makes some people happy in
the short term, it undermines the development of open source software in
the long term.

Instead of producing a straight forward implementation of a Java-compatible
virtual machine, designers are thrown into confusion. They must maintain
competence on JDBC, RMI, JFC/Swing and all of these non-essencial
technologies. With my proposal, you only design a virtual machine when you
want to develop a Java-compatible virtual machine. Non-essencial class
libraries are developed once and all Java-compatible virtual machines can
use them -- verbatim.

It is a double standard. There is a fake core and a true core. Sun
Microsystems promotes the idea of a fake core. They define &quot;core&quot; as the
packages that an application depends on. Frankly, that's stupid. My
application depends on javax.servlet. Why would that be left out of the
core? My application depends on javax.swing. Why would that be that part of
the core?

A true core is defined as the packages that all virtual machines depends
on. The true core is very small. There are only a few packages and few
class that all virtual machines depends on.

This does not include JVM-specific classes either. One virtual machine
depends on a JVM-specific class.

Everything else is non-essential. While it might be nice to have all these
packages in one namespace, it is unnecessary and undesireable to put
non-essencial classes into the virtual machine specification.

I continue to use JDK 1.0. Does JDK 1.0 contain a Java Virtual Machine, or
not? Even JDK 1.0 contains non-essencial packages, like java.applet and
java.awt.

&gt;&gt;<i> 5. The Classpath Project has not solved the puzzle of JVM-specific classes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or native methods. Instead, they have added JVM-specific classes to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> java.* namespace.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	On the other hand, they /did/ break the JVM-specific classes off
</I>&gt;<i>into a separate tree from the rest of them.  This would suggest converting
</I>&gt;<i>them to BCNI wouldn't be terribly difficult.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here is my proposal. We need a liason between JOS and Classpath. In order
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for us to reuse the software created by the Classpath Project, it must be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perfectly compatible with the Java specification or it must not be added to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the java.* namespace.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	Oh, BTW, classpath is going to merge with gcj, (native java
</I>&gt;<i>compiler front-end to gcc), so it looks like they're going to add another
</I>&gt;<i>'primary' (i.e. japhar) platform for their class library and merge in a
</I>&gt;<i>good chunk of new code.  Whoever this liason might be should definitely
</I>&gt;<i>get in on the action soon -- as long as the codebase is undergoing big
</I>&gt;<i>changes, it will be easier to to get our changes in.
</I>
You understand what classpath means to us. What approach should we use?
What plan should we have to help classpath put together the best cleanroom
implementation of Java class libraries?

On the one hand, bad habits are hard to break. Classpath has already set
precedent by developing their classes in the java.* namespace. How will
they learn there's an easier way?

What are the implications of merging with gcj? Does it mean that I will be
able to use C/C++ pre-processor with Java source code?

&gt;<i>	I'm working on getting classpath to work with the host build of
</I>&gt;<i>jJOS right now.  It looks like decaf has a bug when working with
</I>&gt;<i>classfiles generated by compilers other than javac, in that it expects the
</I>&gt;<i>compiler to have gone ahead and chased down the actual class/interface to
</I>&gt;<i>which the field/method belongs -- that is, it does NOT check the parents
</I>&gt;<i>of the class to which a Fieldref_info points, because it should be (?)
</I>&gt;<i>pointing to the right one.  This might require some fairly substantial
</I>&gt;<i>changes to a part of the back-end, because I'm not sure the field-table
</I>&gt;<i>structure I set up will work for what amounts to multiple
</I>&gt;<i>inheritance.  (Sigh.)
</I>
A bytecode verifier is important to the success of a Java-compatible
virtual machine. I am still looking for the bytecode verifier in decaf.
Once I knew about the need for a bytecode verifier, I went about creating a
pure reflection package. It is a separate package, written in Java, to
decode &quot;class files&quot;. This Java-based prototype was written for the purpose
of implementing it eventually in C++.

A bytecode verifier is a stand-alone subsystem. Like pure reflection, it is
independent of any virtual machine. The bytecode verifier exposes
variations between different javac tools. When integrated into decaf, for
example, it would &quot;protect&quot; decaf from bytecode you describe (until decaf
can handle it).
