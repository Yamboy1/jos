<PRE>	I'll agree with point 1 and 2, but I can't agree with 3.  java.*
has to be there if we want normal java 1.x/2.x applications to run.  

&gt;<i> 4. Much of the effort cannot be reused in an off-the-shelf virtual machine
</I>&gt;<i> from Sun Microsystems or others.
</I>
	Unfortunately, I think this will be true for any class
library.  The phrase 'class library' is misleading in a way that suggests
it's not an integral part of the VM; it doesn't (AFAIK) /have/ to be, but
Sun seems to have designed it that way.

&gt;<i> 5. The Classpath Project has not solved the puzzle of JVM-specific classes
</I>&gt;<i> or native methods. Instead, they have added JVM-specific classes to the
</I>&gt;<i> java.* namespace.
</I>
	On the other hand, they /did/ break the JVM-specific classes off
into a separate tree from the rest of them.  This would suggest converting
them to BCNI wouldn't be terribly difficult.

&gt;<i> Here is my proposal. We need a liason between JOS and Classpath. In order
</I>&gt;<i> for us to reuse the software created by the Classpath Project, it must be
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly compatible with the Java specification or it must not be added to
</I>&gt;<i> the java.* namespace.
</I>
	Oh, BTW, classpath is going to merge with gcj, (native java
compiler front-end to gcc), so it looks like they're going to add another
'primary' (i.e. japhar) platform for their class library and merge in a
good chunk of new code.  Whoever this liason might be should definitely
get in on the action soon -- as long as the codebase is undergoing big
changes, it will be easier to to get our changes in.


	I'm working on getting classpath to work with the host build of
jJOS right now.  It looks like decaf has a bug when working with
classfiles generated by compilers other than javac, in that it expects the
compiler to have gone ahead and chased down the actual class/interface to
which the field/method belongs -- that is, it does NOT check the parents
of the class to which a Fieldref_info points, because it should be (?)
pointing to the right one.  This might require some fairly substantial
changes to a part of the back-end, because I'm not sure the field-table
structure I set up will work for what amounts to multiple
inheritance.  (Sigh.)
