That's what gets me excited. That's exactly what I would like to have on my
own JOS machine. No muss. No fuss. Just the bytes I need to run JOS. And I
think we're so close to it, too.

System requirements, like those you provided, should be distributed someday
inside a &quot;readme&quot; file with the binary distribution. When everybody has the
standard distribution of JOS-that-boots-from-GRUB, we can verify those
requirements.

Here's an idea out of nowhere: Why not call JOS-that-boots-from-GRUB
something like JOS/GX? Java-Operating System-Boots-GRUB. Going backward,
JOS-that-boots-from-Etherboot should be JOS/EX.

&gt;<i>This will give us experience with the kernel on multiple machines, 
</I>&gt;<i>workout some distribution issues, and see about integrating GRUB 
</I>&gt;<i>and the kernel and building bootable floppy disk images.
</I>
Distribution is something you have to practice. The earlier you get in the
habit of distribution, the smoother the finished product is installed on
the desk of the end-user.

I agree. I think we should focus on distributing ONE copy of JOS that boots
the same for every member of the JOS Project. Just as messages from the
kernal group indicate, different people are booting different things --
even though they have CVS in common. Sure, CVS works. But a binary
distribution of JOS lets everyone compare what they custom build to a
standard distribution.

After that has been accomplished, I think we'll have learned something in
the process. The next distribution will be easier.
