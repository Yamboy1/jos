<PRE>	Okay, I understand the desire for the org.classpath namespace
now; my apologies for being obtuse.  Nonetheless, their system is intended
as a drop-in class library for japhar (and kaffe), so it makes sense from
their p.o.v. to just go ahead and name their stuff 'right' the first
time.  I don't think we'll be able to change their minds...

	Regarding the class library as not strictly integrated with the
Virtual Machine, you're quite right: technically, only a very few classes
have anything at all to do with the virtual machine, and that it's the
java.lang.* and company packages that make it a /java/ virtual
machine.  A better phrasing would be &quot;the class library is an integral
part of the java platform.&quot; 

&gt;<i> A true core is defined as the packages that all virtual machines depends
</I>&gt;<i> on. The true core is very small. There are only a few packages and few
</I>&gt;<i> class that all virtual machines depends on.
</I>
	Yes.  Everything else -- aside from the native methods -- is or
should be directly portable from library to library.

&gt;<i> This does not include JVM-specific classes either. One virtual machine
</I>&gt;<i> depends on a JVM-specific class.
</I>
	I believe Sun designed their library so that the overlap between
this and the above is nearly complete, but I haven't checked.

&gt;<i> Everything else is non-essential. While it might be nice to have all these
</I>&gt;<i> packages in one namespace, it is unnecessary and undesireable to put
</I>&gt;<i> non-essencial classes into the virtual machine specification.
</I>
	It is, unfortunately, what we're stuck with.

&gt;<i> You understand what classpath means to us. What approach should we use?
</I>&gt;<i> What plan should we have to help classpath put together the best cleanroom
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of Java class libraries?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the one hand, bad habits are hard to break. Classpath has already set
</I>&gt;<i> precedent by developing their classes in the java.* namespace. How will
</I>&gt;<i> they learn there's an easier way?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What are the implications of merging with gcj? Does it mean that I will be
</I>&gt;<i> able to use C/C++ pre-processor with Java source code?
</I>
	While that would be nice, I'm not sure if it's the
case.  (Actually, you can run java code through the C preprocessor by hand
right now: cpp code.java.cpp | sed -e 's/#.*//' &gt; code.java; javac
code.java -- where the sed removes the leading '# 1 &lt;filename&gt;' that cpp
inserts.  YMMV.)

&gt;<i> A bytecode verifier is important to the success of a Java-compatible
</I>&gt;<i> virtual machine. I am still looking for the bytecode verifier in decaf.
</I>
	It's not there.  The only verification I perform what's implicit
in checking for proper operation of the VM and clean .class files.
