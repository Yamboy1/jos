<PRE>&gt;<i> If you've got a server farm, you need a new operating system. ... You
</I>&gt;<i> simply cannot run a traditional operating system efficiently on a server farm.
</I>
	I'll agree to that.

&gt;<i> Yes, you should be able to group them arbitrary ways. I would prefer a
</I>&gt;<i> classic approach to grouping, like agent and cluster technology. Java
</I>&gt;<i> agents are the first to be platform-independent enough to roam from one
</I>&gt;<i> machine to the next.
</I>
	Agents -- to my understanding -- normally run only on the machine
where they were started, for the reason that migrating an agent to run on
some other machine is the same problem as migrating code, which hadn't
been solved when agents were designed.  Moving an agent from processor to
processor, as to gain the best performance, should be the responibility of
the operating system, and not the agent.  The exact mechanism for grouping
them -- some variety of clustering technology -- was not what I was
addressing.  Most clustering solutions today are not so dynamic as the one
that would be required to make efficient use out of a 256-processor server
farm.

&gt;<i> After forming a reply, I wonder if your definition of &quot;parallel&quot; processing
</I>&gt;<i> is the same as mine. Parallel processing is where one program is running,
</I>&gt;<i> with only one &quot;thread of control&quot;, and parts of the program are
</I>&gt;<i> automatically divided among more than one processor on a motherboard. A
</I>&gt;<i> network is not part of this kind of parallel processing.
</I>
	Parallel processing takes many forms.  Strictly speaking, we're
looking at concurrent processing, that is, processing where parts of the
work (calculations) of the program are time/order independent of the
others.  (Concurrency may or may not be exploited in a strictly parallel
fashion depending on the available hardware.)  In general, the best
performance is gained from explicit concurrency -- using systems such as
PVM or MPI to explicitly code the parallel portions of a
program.  Performance will also benefit from heavy threading and light
synchronization, where different threads can execute simultaneously on
different processors.  Parallelism such as you describe is typically the
least efficient, where the hardware (or, for fork()ing programs, the
OS) has to decide how to parallelize the program.

	Parallel processing typically has two hardware forms: symmetric
multi-processing and clusters.  SMP is N processors per motherboard,
tightly linked (e.g. very high bandwith interconnects), typically sharing
the same RAM.  Clustering can use SMP boxes/mobos, or single processor
boxes/mobos, and combine them with slower interconnects, typically
off-the-shelf networking like 100baseT ethernet.  Naturally, SMP performs
better for tightly-coupled processing (where alot of data is shared) and
clustering is more efficient for loosely-coupled processing (where almost
no data is shared).  The <A HREF="mailto:seti@home">seti@home</A> and rc5-crack attempts are good
examples of clustered computing.

	They are not, however, distributed computing in the sense that I
understand it, because both report their results back to a single 'master'
node that then hands work units back out.  Distributed processing is more
like the IRC network, a large group of peers each doing what needs to be
done locally to generate a global effect -- that is, distributed systems
do NOT have a single 'master' node.


	A server-farm-in-a-box, according to your description, will be an
16-way cluster of 16-way SMPs.  The way you seem to want to do things, you
want to maintain all 256 of those processors as separate machines -- to
me, that just seems like a great deal of extra work.

&gt;<i> I cannot justify automatic load-balancing across all 256 processors.
</I>
	Why not?  It's free (almost) in the operating system / daemons
running on those processors.  It makes /your/ life that much simpler,
because you don't have to worry about balancing the load by hand.  If you
want, you'd be able to exclude certain processors/motherboards from the
'processing pool' and manage them manually -- presumambly to dedicate them
to web serving, or file serving, etc.  But when userA logs in, it doesn't
matter which of the other processors userA's jobs run on, so why bother to
decide by hand when the load-balancing daemons/kernels ask each other
whose not busy.  It results in better performance for everyone using the
farm.  If you have a large processing job that you /know/ is tightly
bound, you can dedicate a motherboard and its processors to the job,
setting it to realease that group to the pool when the job is done.  For a
more loosely-coupled job, you might want to specify that it uses no more
than two processors per motherboard.

&gt;<i> In general, people must choose to set up specific services on specific
</I>&gt;<i> machines.
</I>
	That used to be true; it no longer is, and that's the idea behind
most clustering technologies.  N machines can 'hide' behind one
net-address and split the work up amonst themselves.  There's no reason to
not to treat net-addresses as logical addresses, rather than physically
correspsonding to a particular machine.

	The key need for one-console to many-machines will not be
communicating with those machines.  (Right now, I'm managing 8 machines
250 miles away without any problems at all, with one
keyboard/mouse/monitor.  I'm using xterms, because I'm hooking up over a
modem, but if I were on something faster, I could run X programs remotely
just as easily.)  The problem will be making efficient use of those
machines.  (Even right now, with one-to-one the primary mode, the vast
majority of processing power on the average desktop goes to waste waiting
for the user to do something; for example, this particular machine is
spending 55% of its time cranking <A HREF="mailto:seti@home">seti@home</A>, and 30% of its time running
desktop animations.  Only 15% of it is concerned with anything that I'm
doing.)  Historically, the most common mode of interaction was many
consoles to one machine, so one typically didn't have cycles to
burn.  The shift to one-to-one was not terribly worrisome, because the
single machines behind the single consoles weren't powerful or connected
enought to be worthwhile.  They are now -- as the rc5 crack/<A HREF="mailto:seti@home">seti@home</A>
groups and other similar ones -- have shown.

	The situation only gets worse as the ratio of consoles (users) to
machines rises.  For servers, if the limiting resource is bandwidth, then
it's a true shame to let all those extra cycles go to waste -- and if it's
an interactive server (i.e. shell account), then you need load-balancing
to any kind of reasonable performance.  If the limiting resource is CPU
time, it's even /more/ important that the limited resources at hand are
used most efficiently -- which, IMHO, would point to an automated system.
