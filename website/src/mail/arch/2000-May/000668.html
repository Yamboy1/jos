A subprogram is a program within a program. This is not implied by a
program launching another program. It seems somewhere along the line you
&quot;extended&quot; your definition of the term to fit your current idea on how
to implement a process API (*)

The distinction between Application and subprogram is necessary to
distinguish programs that are designed to be in other programs. If you
use the term subprogram to refer to them both generically (which you
have (**) ), then you lose that distinction.

(*) ie. to treat everything as a subprogram, and have processes just
execute subprograms. You have already stated that rheise.os does not cut
it in this respect, and that a new process API is needed. If you believe
this, please go ahead and start your own one from scratch.

(**) you mention in this email (to which I am replying) that &quot;a program
is a kind of subprogram. A Java application is a kind-of program, which
is a kind-of subprogram.&quot;

&gt;<i> &gt;Again, it is only required for your way of looking at it. To say it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;required, period, is to force your views upon others. And this is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;especially unfortunate when you claim someone else's project as a

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;bytecode process) simply because it does not meet &quot;your&quot; requirements.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Something is required. Something must sit between a process and an
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary subprogram. What else would you have us call it? How would you
</I>&gt;<i> explain it? The purpose of this thread is to define it. We need to define
</I>&gt;<i> it well enough so that when a programmer writes a JOS-compatible
</I>&gt;<i> subprogram, it will run on any implementation of JOS.
</I>
I call it a mechanism for executing programs inside a process.
[Mis]Defining what a subprogram is gives you a basis for such a
mechanism. I have also invented such a mechanism, different from yours
because of fundamentally different design influences. You can refer to
my past email for the details, but an additional remark I would like to
make is that the mechanism I use considers two types of program APIs,
those that require an instance of a class, and those that don't. The
second category covers Java Applications (and can easily be extended to
support different static method names if that turns out to be useful).
The first category covers servlets and applets (among others), which
incidentally both happen to be subprograms. Unlike in your approach, the
process API does not need to know anything about the object-based
program API (*). Instead, the parent process is given the responsibility
of dealing with the specific program API (eg. applet or servlet). This
is based on the fact that the parent process always knows what type of
program API it is dealing with because it launched it (the interaction
then becomes strongly typed). A tool that can generically launch any
process (eg. SmartAPI) can be built on top of this model.

I'm sure that if you misdefine subprogram, it will work just as well.
Although IMHO it is a way of achieving the same result by
overgeneralising and becoming weakly typed (because of the nature of the
model, not just because of the &quot;subprogram&quot; terminology). But as I said,
I fully understand that your idea will work if you choose to implement
it.

(*) It is probably the case that all object-based program APIs are
subprograms because of the nature of objects (who interacts with them).

&gt;<i> Within the Java Native Interface Specification, Sun describes this as an
</I>&gt;<i> important feature of JNI: the ability to define any method of any class as
</I>&gt;<i> the starting point of your JNI-compatible program. Most importantly, this
</I>&gt;<i> method does not have to be static.
</I>
For starters, I don't know whether we are supporting the Java Native
Interface because we are focusing on a pure Java environment. But let's
look at your examples:

&gt;<i> &gt;I can allow the name of the method to be invoked to be passed in, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;maybe you can give useful examples of this before I implement it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are plenty of examples shown on this mailing list and JOS Wiki. Here
</I>&gt;<i> are my favorites.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. java.lang.Runnable. The simplest instance method for a Java subprogram
</I>&gt;<i> is run(). Run is a blocking call.
</I>
This fits the category of object-based program API. The reason (a
reason) I made the distinction is that object-based APIs can be handled
without reflection and don't need special support within the process
framework. The client can invoke methods directly on the object (whereas
it cannot do that as easily with a static method).

I was asking specifically about invoking static methods other than
'main'. While there are many examples of object-based APIs with all
sorts of methods (applet.start(), applet.stop(), servlet.service()),
there is only one example I can think of for static methods: main. There
is one other example of a static entry point I am aware of (used in the
Javadoc system) but even it does not need the support from the process
framework. However, it opens up the possibility that there &quot;might&quot; be
examples. Can you think of any?

&gt;<i> 2. java.lang.Component.
</I>
Another object-based API (which can be interacted with &quot;directly&quot; in
order to remain strongly typed).

&gt;<i> 3. The classes in my subprogram APIs have been explicitly designed with
</I>&gt;<i> subprograms in mind. My subprogram APIs has been plugged into the Smart
</I>&gt;<i> API, so that any shell can invoke many different kind of subprograms,
</I>&gt;<i> including foreign OS subprograms and Java applications. All this and more
</I>&gt;<i> is documented on the Smart API pages of JOS Wiki.
</I>
They too are object-based, are they not? However this is the closest we
have come yet to a static entry point. I could imagine you doing certain
of your subprogram types as static APIs. IN THE CASE where you wished to
run those subprograms as processes, then it would be useful to specify a
method name (and arg types) other than main. But then again, why not use
&quot;main&quot; as the method name? In this example, your subprogram is
effectively a &quot;Java Application&quot; anyway. OTOH, you may wish to define
different argument types. Still, perhaps if you wanted to do this,
you're program API would already start diverging from the standard
command-line API (procedural/static entry) that it may as well be an
object..

&gt;<i> Here are examples of what I would like to do with a process:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   public void example() {
</I>&gt;<i>     Runtime.exec( &quot;jrew -classpath ~/debug:$CLASSPATH MyApp&quot; );
</I>&gt;<i>     Runtime.exec( &quot;java.awt.Button&quot; );
</I>&gt;<i>     Runtime.exec( &quot;MyCustomApplet height=10 width=60&quot; );
</I>&gt;<i>     Runtime.exec( &quot;<A HREF="http://www.jos.org/"">http://www.jos.org/&quot;</A> );
</I>&gt;<i>     Runtime.exec( &quot;<A HREF="ftp://mindspring.com/"">ftp://mindspring.com/&quot;</A> );
</I>&gt;<i>   }
</I>
These weakly typed examples can be implemented on-top-of the simpler
mechanism I have proposed (and it makes sense to have the strongly typed
API underly the weakly typed one).

However, since we fundamentally disagree, you may as well roll your own
process API. I never claimed rheise.os to be the standard JOS one. It
can be used by JOS if JOS wants to use it. Choice is good.
