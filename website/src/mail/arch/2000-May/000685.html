<PRE>The state of an object is data, separate from its behavior. The state of an
object can be modified. A class is required to modify the behavior of an
object. An object cannot modify its own behavior.

If O1 is the state of an object, it is not possible for O1 to act upon O1.
Another object is always required. Therefore, if O2 -&gt; O1 then O2 != O1.

The state of an object has a structure. The structure is compatible with
(1) one class or (2) more than one class. If state structure is compatible
with one class, state cannot be modified safely by any other class. If
state structure is compatible with more than one class, the number of
compatible classes is limited. In general, most classes are not compatible
with an object. An object has far more incompatible classes than compatible
classes. Incompatible classes are likely to corrupt the state of an object.

If O1 is the state of an object, C1 and C2 are classes, and C1 is the only
compatible class, then C2 -&gt; 01 is likely to corrupt the state of O1.

If O1 is the state of an object and C1 is an unknown class, then C1 -&gt; O1
is likely to corrupt the state of O1.

When the state structure of an object is compatible with more than one
class, we can use this to copy an object from one platform to another.

If O1 is the state of an object and both C1 and C2 are known to be
compatible with O1, then C1 -&gt; O1, C2 -&gt; O1.

If O1 is the state of an object and only C1 is known to be compatible with
O1, then C2 -&gt; O1 if an only if C1 ~= C2.

C1 and C2 are known to be equivalent if C1 and C2 implement the same
interface. C2 implements the same interface as C1 if C2 extends C1. C2 also
implements the same interface as C1 if both C1 and C2 extend C3.

-----

In Java, C1 and C2 are known to be equivalent if the bytecode for C1 and C2
are identical, equal or equivalent. If C1.bc == C2.bc, their bytecode is
identical. If C1.bc.equals( C1.bc ) but C1.bc != C2.bc, their bytecode is
equal, not identical. (It is a little more difficult to measure equivalence
in bytecode and nearly impossible in machine code.)

Therefore, objects can be safely shared safely across custom class loaders,
and should be. If C1 and C2 are unknown classes, CL1 and CL2 are custom
class loaders, if C1 and C2 are loaded by CL1 and CL2 respectively, then C1
and C2 are known to be equivalent if their bytecode is identical, equal or
equivalent. Since C1 -&gt; O1 is safe and C2 -&gt; O1 is safe, an object O1 can
be safely shared by two class loaders. In this case, the class loader is
irrelevant.

In an applet viewer which runs each applet through a custom class loader,
applets share system classes. This proof shows that applets can safely
share custom classes.

In a servlet runner which runs each servlet through a custom class loader,
servlets shared system classes. This proof shows that servlets can safely
share custom classes.

On the other hand, the purpose of creating multiple primordial class
loaders is to prevent the sharing of any objects between independent
processes. If O1 and O2 are objects, C1 and C2 are their respective
classes, P1 and P2 are bytecode processes, if O1 and O2 are owned by P1 and
P2 respectively, then neither C1 -&gt; O2 nor C2 -&gt; 01 is safe -- even if C1
and C2 are known to be equivalent.

In an MPCL-compatible virtual machine which runs each process through a
primordial class loader, processes do not share system classes. This proof
shows that processes can safely share neither system nor custom classes.

-----

Any bytecode process can copy a primative value to any other bytecode
process. Primative types in Java are sharable across all virtual machines
and all bytecode processes because the machine code &quot;classes&quot; for primative
types are known to be compatible. When object state is broken down into
primative values, an object can be copied from one bytecode process to
another in a mechanism much like serialization. Within a vm, this would be
superfast.

Since a message is always a collection of primative types and any call to a
method can be converted into a message, an object in one process can invoke
a method in another process by simple message passing. Any user process
passes a message to the system process. In turn, the system process passes
a message to any user process. And that is how object state is shared.
