<PRE>&gt;<i> None which are granted by the kernel. The fact that it is recorded by
</I>&gt;<i> the kernel, though, means it can be used at the user level.
</I>
	I begin to see the light.

&gt;<i> The kernel doesn't care how it is used. But garbage collection in the
</I>&gt;<i> kernel would benefit from smart use of object ownership by user
</I>&gt;<i> processes. That was my point about multiple ownership of objects. If we
</I>&gt;<i> emulate it the way I suggested, that helps the garbage collector - it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't leave dead processes around in memory (besides, that's ugly,
</I>&gt;<i> conceptually).
</I>
	Er -- aren't references and ownership indistinguishable from the
POV of the garbage collector*?  Let me re-phrase the question: when is it
beneficial to make the distinction between process-with-reference and
process-with-ownership?  (Or, more accurately, but equivalently, when is
it beneficial to distinguish between reference-from and
reference-from-owner?)  If a process dies, its entire memory tree is
pruned.  If we decide that all shared objects operate with weak
references, this is not a problem, right?  The reference just becomes
null.  (Having never /used/ weak references, I'm probably wrong about
something here.)  (OTOH, weak references are a JDK1.2 thing, right?)

&gt;<i> That's the nature of the system. An object is associated with one class,
</I>&gt;<i> which is associated with one defining class loader, which is associated
</I>&gt;<i> with one process. Therefore, objects are owned by (/associated with)
</I>&gt;<i> processes and that is reflected in the implementation of the
</I>&gt;<i> kernel(/JVM). Reassigning ownership of an object to another process is
</I>&gt;<i> therefore a kernel(/JVM) primative, too.
</I>
	Okay, I think I understand where you're coming from here.  I tend
to think of it as an object HasA process, rather than a process OwnsAn
object.  This is because a process is not an object abstraction at the JVM
level, except for the back-end to the interface.  This is done
deliberately so that we can be absolutely certain that whatever
correctness our single-process JVM has, the multiple-process one does
also.  The necessary exception -- cross-process casting -- is the one
which we've spending so much time on to ensure its theoretical
correctness.

	W.r.t. to garbage collection, that a Process OwnsAn object (or
that an Object HasA process) doesn't seem -- that I'm seeing - to impact
the number of live references to the object, which is what matters to a
garbage collector.  If a process sharing an object terminates without
using the setSomeOtherOwner() (or whatever) function, it may have good a
reason for doing so -- the shared object may depend on its
originating/owner process for functionality.  I don't see that the GC
needs to worry about.


	Quick little question session: the kernel (/decaf) already
maintains 'ownership' (origination) information.  Is the proposal that for
(only shared?) objects, we should be able to perform a lookup from it to
the classloaders/processes which could reference it?  (e.g. had, at one
point, shared it.  This does not necessarily mean it actually /does/
reference it.)  And that there is some efficiency/elegance gain from
maintaining such a reverse lookup?

* I couldn't, in the time available, find the e-mail where you talked
about GC w.r.t. ownership of processes, so you may have explained it
there.
