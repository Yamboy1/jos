&gt;<i>Ok, so you are only planning to put vm-specific classes in this image?
</I>
I'm planning to put &quot;boot&quot; classes inside this image. This includes some
vm-specific classes and part of the standard class library. I do not intend
to put all java.* and javax.* into the executable image.

&gt;<i>Ok, there is a big difference between the vm-specific classes and the
</I>&gt;<i>class library. The class library (including swing, database extensions etc
</I>&gt;<i>etc) could run into multiple megabytes, in which case it would definitely
</I>&gt;<i>not belong in that image.
</I>
I only wanted to provide one example of a virtual machine that conforms to
the Java Virtual Machine Specification and yet does not find rt.jar through
CLASSPATH.

&gt;<i>I agree with you. The only problem is that you are wasting some space. You
</I>&gt;<i>are keeping the bytecode in the image (which is loaded into memory), and
</I>&gt;<i>then you are going to build the internal class structure (which will have
</I>&gt;<i>a copy of the bytecode again, and the results of resolving the constant
</I>&gt;<i>pool). The intial raw class data is going to stay in memory &quot;forever&quot; but
</I>&gt;<i>it is only needed for a short period of time (at startup).
</I>
Again, the wasted space you mention doesn't exist (yet). Your idea of an
internal class structure is obviously different than mine. Your idea of
resolving the constant pool is obviously different than mine. Whenever the
original can be used, the original should be used. Hopefully, the raw class
data for boot classes will stay in memory because a virtual machine
interprets the original opcodes, not a copy.

A primordial class loader is an implementation of the findSystemClass()
method of java.lang.ClassLoader. All of this is internal to a virtual machine.

&gt;<i>I don't see where this is really an advantage. Once you you've loaded,
</I>&gt;<i>linked and resolved a class you don't need the bytecode anymore. You can
</I>&gt;<i>flag the actual method code to be interpreted as read-only anyway.
</I>
When a method is invoked, the Code attribute will be interpreted. It is
still needed.

Constants in a DATA segment are loaded as needed when an executable image
is mapped by a virtual memory manager. It is easy for a VMM to discard a
constant when it is no longer &quot;used&quot;.

&gt;<i>I'm assuming the whole image gets loaded into memory before execution, and
</I>&gt;<i>also stays there until parts get paged out. In this case it makes sense to
</I>&gt;<i>have the image as small as possible.
</I>
The whole image does may not load completely before execution. A virtual
memory manager can map an executable image. Then, constant data is loaded
only through page faults.

&gt;<i>This is a very elegant approach. Writing the file-system reader in Java
</I>&gt;<i>(as opposed to C/C++) and having it available immediately on startup. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Another way of doing this would be to compile that file-system reader to
</I>&gt;<i>native-code (assuming you have the tools to do this), and then just
</I>&gt;<i>firing off that to load whatever is needed from disk to get the VM going.
</I>
Yes, it is a clean design. Whatever can be written in bytecode should be
written in bytecode. This part must be written in bytecode because the file
subsystem is a plug-in. Anyone can write a file subsystem. As long as it
implements the well-known interfaces, it can work in this virtual machine.

The start up sequence and boot classes provide a way to load the file
subsystem plug-in. A file subsystem might be specified as a &quot;module&quot; in
GRUB, instead of the boot classes.
