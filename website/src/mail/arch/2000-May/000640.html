So, if I can translate, you're saying that subprogram APIs (plural) are
useful, and not that &quot;A&quot; subprogram API is necessary. Is my
understanding correct now? Are you simply encouraging people to use
existing subprogram APIs, so then, before you were not trying to point
out any flaws rheise.os for not having subprograms?

Then I don't understand your criticism of rheise.os:

&gt;<i> It is far too premature to adopt rheise.os as a standard for the JOS
</I>&gt;<i> Project. It might lead us to a standard. It may be a useful model. It
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be taken literally.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Give me something I can use. I can't use rheise.os. Running a Java

</I>&gt;<i> as a process.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> Don't be distracted by rheise.os.
</I>
Soon after, you told me that &quot;rheise.os is a dead-end project&quot;.

Why? Because it doesn't have subprograms? You certainly didn't give any
other reasons. If it wasn't subprograms, then you gave no reasons at
all, and your remark was completely uncalled for. Such remarks are
counter-productive to the project, and that sort of attitude that cannot
be tolerated.

However, if I am misunderstanding you, please explain:

- Why is rheise.os a dead-end project, if not because of no subprograms?
- If it is because of no subprograms, why are you now implying that
rheise.os need not implement subprograms (when they already exist in
Sun's API)?

My misunderstanding of the importance of subprograms definately lies
within. Last week I thought you had one opinion. Now it seems you have
another. If you have changed your opinion, have you also changed your
opinion about rheise.os?
