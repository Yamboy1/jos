Ok, I understand you now. My take on it is that it is the object that is
shared, and not the class. This means that the class may still be used
within your process as a separate entity without any interference from
the IPC that is going on with a particular instance of that class.

When talking about the shared object, there is only one memory location
for that static. However, when talking about the class (which is not
shared due to complexities discussed in another email to John), the
static you find is the one that belongs to your process.

If when we share an object, we also share the class, the issue
disappears. BUT, I don't think the class should be shared for two
reasons:

- there are complexities to do with class loader references (ie. it
doesn't make sense conceptually)
- a process should be able to carry on IPC with two different processes
simultaneously using the same the same class type for both shared
objects. However, IPC with one process should not interfere with IPC
with the other. If the Class is shared it cannot be avoided (when
statics are involved).

In your original email you wrote:

</I>
Unfortunately, it is not a matter of ignoring it and throwing
LinkageErrors when it happens, because this will affect applications
even if they are not using shared objects.
