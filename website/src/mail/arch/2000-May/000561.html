I'm not sure this is a good idea. If the GC ignores the link from
ProcessClassLoader to ClassLoader, you also need to ensure that the
reference value of this link becomes null. And a better way to
accomplish the same thing would probably be to simply set this reference
to null the standard way. But what are the implications? Well for
starters, ProcessManager.getOwningProcess() will fail, and I think this
is conceptually bad. Setting this reference to point to another process
rather than null would be better, and a better way of doing this is to
re-assign the class loader link as I have been saying.

I don't know if I understand you're goal here. What makes it desirable
to break the conceptual model? (ie. that an object is always contained
within a process)

&gt;<i> &gt; Not its entire memory tree. If another process has a reference to one of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; its shared objects, the memory tree of that object will hang around in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; memory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         I should have said, its exclusive tree.  Anything shared is now in
</I>&gt;<i> someone else's tree as well... which sounds alot like shared 'ownership',
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't it? :)
</I>
The way I have been seeing it (as I described in another email) is that
there is a difference between sharing ownership and sharing access. This
looks like sharing access - meaning that there is still an original
owner and that affects things when you find that the owning process is
hanging around in memory until the other processes let go of the shared
object which it owns.

&gt;<i> &gt; You want to depend on a dead process for functionality? I think that if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a process was ever alive, its purpose was to live, and any functionality
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you're talking about should be carried on while it is still alive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         Exactly.  Therefore, something absolutely terrible should happen
</I>&gt;<i> to the shared object if the process it depends on for functionality is
</I>&gt;<i> killed.  The handling of such objects is an open question; weak references
</I>&gt;<i> are designed to allow something awful to happen (e.g. GC), so they seemed
</I>&gt;<i> like a natural answer to me.
</I>
So, the functionality you're depending on in the dead process is to make
something terrible happen. Fair enough.

&gt;<i> &gt; However, and this is an idea I couldn't work out how to implement until
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you gave me the idea, it might be desirable to have processes that have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no threads.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         The 'ObjectBroker' process comes to mind.  It may be
</I>&gt;<i> cleaner/easier to implement this as a process that has a single thread
</I>&gt;<i> whose run() method is &quot;sleep();&quot;, though.
</I>
Maybe the ObjectBroker might want to have its own threads to do other
stuff anyway. I suppose you could implement the ObjectBroker the way you
suggested. But I would like something more convenient for embedded
programs like servlets where the parent server simply calls
servlet.service(request, response) and the code in that method is
restricted to its namespace and its own UserToken. When you look at the
way the service() method is called, it is natural that the thread is
owned by the parent process, and the servlet doesn't actually have its
own thread. JDK 1.2 has the concept of changing privileges granted to
the running code depending on where the current class was loaded from.
That's sort of what I want. I need to work on the idea some more.

&gt;<i>         I understand now.  (I think.  I sure didn't before.)  The proposal
</I>&gt;<i> is that the kerne/JVM adds only ownership-reassignment, and the user
</I>&gt;<i> library can provide the rest of the sharing API and implementation.
</I>
Right. And the ownership-reassignment function depends on how we share
class definitions w.r.t. superclasses. See my response to Matt's email
for my thoughts on that. If we only share class definitions if the
superclasses also share class definitions, then ownership-reassignment
can easily be managed for all superclasses. If we can share class
definitions independently of the superclasses, then ownership
reassignment may fail if the superclasses don't match.
