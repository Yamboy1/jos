Yes, if you accept that the JVM has to have class loaders (or disjunct
namespaces) and implement multiple processes by use of these class
loaders, then you can't have all processes using the same internal
structures.

But it would beneficial to reuse as many of the classes as possible. For
example, if all the java.lang, java.io etc classes were always loaded by a
specific class loader, we could gain the time otherwise required to load
each system class.

&gt;<i> In addition to computational efficiency, class definition sharing (which
</I>&gt;<i> is based on class definition caching) minimises memory waste.
</I>
Yes class definition caching will certainly help, although I don't see how
it has much advantage over a conventional file cache.

What is definition sharing?
 
&gt;<i> &gt; This makes it difficult to support different class libraries in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same OS but otherwise has great advantages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to achieve both. True, it does mean not much can be done to
</I>&gt;<i> remove the cost of resolution per process, but IMHO conforming with the
</I>&gt;<i> spec is better (and the cost is not too great - it is at least much
</I>&gt;<i> faster than the class loading process of a typical JVM).
</I>
I can't see any way around the spec. Unless you're going to enforce a
single class for every name in the namespace (ie one classloader, one
version of every class) you have to make provisions for different classes
sharing the same name. Whether this means total separation or partial
sharing is the tricky bit.

 &gt; We can only wait and see if it actually works - I suspect
 &gt; the performance will be significantly faster than a standard JVM.

Not really. If the file system is already caching the .class files, how
will your method be much faster?

But you shouldn't be comparing to a normal JVM, you should be comparing
the native operating environment of other OS'es. Can we compete against
the processes in BeOS, UNIX and Win32?

Will our solution be able to cope when the user starts compiling the whole
class library and spawns hundreds of processes in quick succession?

&gt;<i> (An additional note, interaction between 'ls', 'grep' and 'wc' does not
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily need to involve multiple processes. The equivalent of this
</I>&gt;<i> in an object oriented context might be the interaction of Java beans
</I>&gt;<i> which need not be in separate processes. In this case, the same class
</I>&gt;<i> loader is used and the resolution process is not an issue)
</I>
Yes, but if our Processes are emulating what an application expects when
it runs on a normal JVM, then programmers are going to write to this
specification. They are going to expect pipes, their own copy of static
variables for all classes they are using and so on. 

Perhaps it isn't such a good thing to model the traditional UNIX process
so closely?
