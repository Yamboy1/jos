<PRE>I think it is important to understand both the positives and negatives I
pointed out (I know I wasn't clear enough, though) in order to put
things into perspective. I hope after I explain those points a little
better, you might have some comments on the rest of my original email
(which IMHO was the more interesting part to discuss):

</I>
_Quinn might like to comment here. As he pointed out, when you look at
the implementation of decaf, a class definition is not the same as what
you would put in the bytecode cache. Therefore, it is &quot;extra&quot;
information that we need to hang on to. Sure, you can propose an
alternate JVM design that always keeps the complete class file contents
in memory, and for for this JVM, it would not be considered extra
information.

But, my point is that if a JVM implements the bytecode cache idea, &quot;it
_must_ retain the original payload of the class file&quot;.

&gt;<i> A class definition cache must retain something, a conversion of the
</I>&gt;<i> original payload to something else. A class definition might make a copy of
</I>&gt;<i> Code attributes for each method. This means a class definition may require
</I>&gt;<i> multiple calls to alloc(), one for each Code attribute.
</I>
I'll leave _Quinn to respond to JVM implemenation details :-)

&gt;<i> &gt;2. it must always read the class data from disk or network when defining
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;a class.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. No, not at all. When defining a class, a bytecode cache has little to do
</I>&gt;<i> with a disk or network. A bytecode cache is plugged into the
</I>&gt;<i> ClassLoader.defineClass() method. It does not know and does not care where
</I>&gt;<i> the payload came from. It works across the board for both primordial and
</I>&gt;<i> custom class loaders.
</I>
I think you missed my point completely :-) &quot;it&quot; doesn't refer to the
bytecode cache, but to the code that is *forced* by the bytecode cache
to generate or read the class data from some source every time.

So, my point is that you &quot;must always read --or generate-- class data
from disk or network --or some other source-- when defining a class&quot; in
the bytecode cache approach.

The &quot;or some other source&quot; should cover any further responses, I think,
including sources such as the filesystem cache.

&gt;<i> &gt;3. it must always do a byte for byte comparison to ensure class
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;definition sharing is valid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Not exactly. If the payload is retained, a byte-for-byte comparison of
</I>&gt;<i> one payload to another is the most efficient comparison I can think of. But
</I>&gt;<i> the implementation of the comparison operator is left up to the
</I>&gt;<i> implementor. If there is a safer or faster way to compare two class
</I>&gt;<i> definitions, find it and use it.
</I>
Just to keep things in perspective (my aim), a perfect comparator is
always more computationally expensive, however you do it.

So, my point is that &quot;it must always do a byte for byte comparison -- or
something to that effect -- to ensure class definition sharing is valid.
This is inherently more computationally expensive.&quot;

I hope this time my points are clear. If they still contain errors, I
hope you at least see the actual disadvantages I am trying to show in
each point, as well as the advantages I am trying to show in each point.
I do still believe this is an accurate analysis that puts things in
perspective and enables us to see that merging our two approaches (yours
which focusses memory efficiency, and mine which focusses on
computational efficiency) &quot;might&quot; be beneficial in the end.

Which of the three alternatives is most beneficial we can discuss in the
other thread.
