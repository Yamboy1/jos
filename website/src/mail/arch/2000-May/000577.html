What is the critical difference between JNI and MPCL? It is not the
reloading of classes. It is not the sharing class definitions. It is not
the implementing of multiple Java processes in a single machine code
process. The critical difference between JNI and MPCL is this:

1. JNI is supported by hundreds of organizations; MPCL is not. Both conform
to the same Java Virtual Machine Specifications. Both manage multiple
bytecode processes in a single machine code process.

2. JNI automatically creates four threads per bytecode process; MPCL might
create only three. The four threads are main thread, UI thread, garbage
collection thread and finalizer thread. Of the four threads, only garbage
collection thread is different. JNI creates a process-wide garbage
collection thread. MPLC creates a vm-wide garbage collection thread.

Otherwise, JNI and MPCL are the same.

Efficiency is beyond the scope of the Java Virtual Machine Specification. A
highly efficient virtual machine comes from the hard work of a virtual
machine designer. There are already many highly efficient virtual machines
using both the classic and JNI design.

Some programmers have written a obviously poor implementation of
ClassLoader.findSystemClass(). We can't dismiss the entire classic design
just because of that. The greatest inefficiency of some virtual machines
comes from their primordial class loader. The specification does not
require a virtual machine to implement a inefficient primordial class
loader. Any primordial class loader will do. A class loader could obtain
all of its classes from bytecode as a resource. A class loader can obtain
all of its classes through a dynamic shared library or a primordial class
service. It does not need a local file subsystem. An efficient class loader
does not need to keep track of where classes came from.

No matter how fast it is, it still exists. Each new class must be loaded,
verified and resolved. The creation, verification and resolution of classes
cannot be removed successfully and maintain compatibility with the
specification. Every virtual machine must create and resolve every class in
the standard class library for every independent process. This step cannot
be skipped, only made more efficient.

A cache of platform-independent bytecode would make it more efficient. A
cache of platform-dependent class definitions would make it more efficient.
In the end, a virtual machine must create a unique class that is owned
exclusively by a process. Even if that class is a proxy for some hidden
component, it still exists and must be created. Even if a class is a shared
object, it still exists and must be shared.

Conventional JVMs use either a classic or JNI design. The classic design
should not be confused with the JNI design. The primordial class loader in
the classic design is not particularly efficient. For example, a poor
implementation of CLASSPATH enables someone to run a virtual machine with
the wrong standard class libraries. The virtual machine specification does
not require this. You /can't/ get it wrong on IBM's JVM for OS/400.

The JNI design is far more efficient. The JNI design enables many JVMs in a
single machine code process. An highly efficient virtual machine for OS/400
has been available from IBM for at least a year, maybe longer. IBM chose to
implement multiple Java processes in a single JVM.

Multiple primordial class loader is a research project. It is only a little
different than the classic and JNI design. A MPCL-compatible virtual
machine is an extension of the classic design, not JNI. It enables a
virtual machine to run multiple bytecode processes by enabling multiple
primordial class loaders. A combination of JNI and MPCL is possible.

While a JNI-compatible design assumes at least four threads for each
bytecode process, an MPCL-compatible design does not. With all four threads
it becomes only slightly more efficient than JNI.

Without three threads for each bytecode process, the MPCL is incompatible
with the specification. Even MPCL needs a finalizer thread, so that the
finalize() method runs in the correct bytecode process. You wouldn't want
code in a finalize() method to run in some other process, would you?

All three designs can be made more efficient with bytecode as a resource
and/or a bytecode cache and/or a class definition cache. There is nothing
inherent in MPCL that always makes it better than classic or JNI designs.

Look at JNI. There is nothing inherent in multiple virtual machines that
requires more than a single machine code process.
