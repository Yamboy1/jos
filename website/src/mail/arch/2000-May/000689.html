The rheise.os/classes should always appear in your classpath *after* the
system classes. With jdk 1.2 you can actually exclude the system classes
from your classpath and the JVM will make sure the system classes are
always loaded first. I recommend doing this since the currently released
version of rheise.os assumes that your system classes are called
classes.zip (as in jdk1.1). If you want to have rt.jar in your
classpath, you will need to fix your copy of
src/josp/process/host/HostProcessClassLoader.java as instructed in the
readme file.

Note that I have only tested this on Linux. I can verify that jdk 1.1
works fully, and jdk 1.2 works partially (no graphics support). I
haven't yet sorted out the issues with ibm's jdk 1.3, which are
apparently similar to the issues people have been having with windows
(security related errors), but it will be a while before I look at those
(and there's no guarantee I can get it working on Windows since I don't
have a copy of any of microsoft's operating systems)

So, try those two suggestions, and if that doesn't work maybe you can
copy and paste the actual error messages.
