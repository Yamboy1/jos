The goal in this proposal was to minimise waste and at the same time
comply with the spec. The need to resolve symbolic references is a
performance penalty but doing I/O to load class files is a much bigger
one (especially when reading from a jar archive). The second one can be
solved through class definition caching (and to some extent, file level
caching), but the first one remains because the spec requires it.

In addition to computational efficiency, class definition sharing (which
is based on class definition caching) minimises memory waste.

Some more memory can be saved by doing more I/O (a tradeoff), as Gilbert
pointed out (references?)

&gt;<i> This makes it difficult to support different class libraries in the
</I>&gt;<i> same OS but otherwise has great advantages.
</I>
I'd like to achieve both. True, it does mean not much can be done to
remove the cost of resolution per process, but IMHO conforming with the
spec is better (and the cost is not too great - it is at least much
faster than the class loading process of a typical JVM).

We can only wait and see if it actually works - I suspect the
performance will be significantly faster than a standard JVM.

(An additional note, interaction between 'ls', 'grep' and 'wc' does not
necessarily need to involve multiple processes. The equivalent of this
in an object oriented context might be the interaction of Java beans
which need not be in separate processes. In this case, the same class
loader is used and the resolution process is not an issue)
