Just a small point regarding this.  Yes, we need a protocol stack, but
that's a shared resource for the OS.  How will we share the protocol stack
between processes, when we need a shared protocol stack to share objects?

Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems to me that there needs to be a
bare minimum object sharing mechanism built into the kernel / process
system, so that more robust sharing models can be built up from that.  We
can always make that low-level object sharing mechanism highly protected so
only &quot;process 0&quot; can have access to it.  But still, there needs to be a
basic, built-in system to start everything out right.
