<PRE>Let's get back to the discussion. The reloading of classes cannot be
ignored. Each process has its own potentially unique CLASSPATH. So, each
process must load its own classes.

All classes must be unique to a bytecode process. None can be shared
without a proxy. Each class in process A must be different than each class
in process B. When the process is garbage collected, all of its classes are
garbage collected.

In a classic design, all classes in a virtual machine are discarded when a
virtual machine dies. In a JNI design, all classes in a virtual machine are
discarded when a virtual machine dies. Sometimes, these classes are not
even finalized.

When a Java application runs inside a MPCL-compatible virtual machine, all
of its classes must be discarded when a process dies. All classes created
by a process are owned by a process. Everything owned by a process is
discarded when the process dies.

A process can share objects with any other process, not just the process
that created it. For more information, see also ParentProcess article on
JOS Wiki.

-----

Here again are processes A and B. Because each process might have its own
CLASSPATH, the superclass of a class can change from one process to another.

In one process, I can have this:

public abstract class AbstractWidget {
}

public class CustomWidget
    extends AbstractWidget {
}

while in another, I can have this:

public abstract class AbstractWidget {
}

public class BasicWidget 
    extends AbstractWidget {
}

public class CustomWidget
    extends BasicWidget {
}

Both are valid and appropriate within their own process. The CLASSPATH of
process A can be different than the CLASSPATH of process B.

-----

A versionless virtual machine is able to adapt at runtime to different
versions of the Java standard class libraries. The class library is plugged
into a versionless virtual machine through CLASSPATH. Within a single
virtual machine, each process is built upon a different platform. One
process can run Java 2 platform while another runs Java 1.
