I think he meant just to test the behaviour of the servletrunner
process, not the termination of individual servlets (correct me if I'm
wrong).

&gt;<i> In a classic UNIX environment you need the protection that a process

</I>&gt;<i> etc), but with Java this falls away.
</I>
Not entirely. A process is owned by a user and is granted the
permissions of that user (eg. permission to write to /home/john/*).
Since a servlet engine is a single process, it grants the same
permissions to every servlet running, and ideally you would like to
grant each servlet its own permission set (different users running
different servlets intending to be accessed on the same standard port).

This means it would be useful to invent something to contain a servlet.
It could be a threadless process (contradiction?), or it could be
something else. Perhaps these two things, whatever they are, inherit
from a base class this commonality:

- They are both owned by users.
- They are both restricted by a permission set.
- They can both potentially exist in separate namespaces. 

The third one is interesting because it allows you to run two different
versions of the same servlet in the same servlet engine. My ideas on
this are incomplete at the moment so if you have anything to add, you're
very welcome.

&gt;<i> I don't think Java protects very well against a rogue servlet spawning
</I>&gt;<i> many threads and consuming lots of CPU time though.
</I>
Good point. It is the duty of an operating system to place restrictions
on resources like this. For example, max processes per user, max threads
per process, max memory usage per user/per process etc. I haven't worked
out where it fits in yet.
