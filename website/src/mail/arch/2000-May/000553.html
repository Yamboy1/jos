Excellent point about superclasses (more on this down below).

The bytecode vs. class definition discussion we have been having refers
to the two proposals that have been made for saving memory and at the
same time, allowing safe object sharing between processes for efficient
IPC. The terms are badly named, leading to confusion.

- class definition: apparently refers to my proposal to share class
  definitions between java.lang.Class'es with the same name that were
  loaded from the same version of the same archive (through a primordial
  class loader), and to allow illegal casts between any two classes that
  share the same class definition (thus giving us inter-process object
  sharing). This proposal was published at:

  <A HREF="http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/jos/java_processes.txt">http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/jos/java_processes.txt</A>

- bytecode: apparently refers to Gilbert's proposal to share class
  definitions between java.lang.Class'es whenever their bytecodes
  exactly match. This, for example, picks up the opportunity to share
  class definitions when the two classes were loaded from two completely
  different archives (eg. in two different users' home directories) but
  are still exactly the same when compared byte for byte. Thus it squeezes
  even more memory out of the system, but at the expense of a less
  efficient algorithm (comparing byte for byte is much slower than
  comparing file location and modification date)

  The same semantics for illegal casts applies here, with the
  clarification that, since Gilbert's proposal allows byte comparison of
  classes loaded by custom class loaders, illegal casts are only allowed
  for the subset of classes that are loaded by primordial class loaders.

So, your point about requiring the line(s) of superclasses(*) to also
share class definitions with the line(s) of superclasses in the other
process applies to illegal casts in both styles of class definition
sharing.

Requiring superclasses to share class definitions for illegal casts to
work is clearly the most correct way to handle it. But as _Quinn pointed
out, things might work out by themselves anyway. If they do, we can save
ourselves from having to do a more expensive check to allow illegal
casts.

To answer _Quinn's question, what happens if we don't verify the
compatibility of superclasses? The calling process is only able to
access the subset of inhehrited methods it knows about (ignoring
reflection for the moment). In addition, if it tries to call a method it
thinks is there but is not, it should throw a NoSuchMethodError(**). The
object, defined by its class and superclasses is really owned by the
other process so there is no doubt what methods can be called on it and
what methods cannot. The same goes for fields.

The behaviour is similar to what I proposed for access to static members
of shared objects. The client process accesses only what it sees, but
internal method calls inside the shared object will see through the eyes
of the owning process.

Whether or not we verify all superclasses before permitting an illegal
cast, it will very rarely be the case that the superclasses are not
compatible (the inheritance chain would have to go through a number of
different archives). The difference is what error we get when it does
happen: NoSuchMethodError or ClassCastException. That, and a
NoSuchMethodError might never be thrown if the method is never called.
This can be considered a good thing or a bad thing.

(*) This is to imply Java does have multiple inheritence but only one
superclass may be a class. The rest must be interfaces.

(**) The same error you get when you find yourself running your program
against the wrong version of a library.
