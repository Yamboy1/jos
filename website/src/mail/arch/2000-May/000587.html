<PRE>&gt;<i>From the JNI spec:
</I>
&gt;<i> JDK 1.1 does not support creating more than one VM in a single process. 
</I>
	The '1.2 enchancements' page makes no mention of this limitation
being removed, or if it remains.  In the context of the 1.1 spec, I
understand this to mean that a single /calling/ process may not have more
than one VM -- not placing any limits on the VM itself.  The lack of such
a mention in the 1.2 spec would seem to leave open the possibility of a
'dispatch' process and/or IPC on the JVM handle for a single process which
uses JNI to generate &gt; 1 JVM.

&gt;<i> Look at JNI. There is nothing inherent in multiple virtual machines that
</I>&gt;<i> requires more than a single machine code process.
</I>
	And there is also nothing inherent in them to support
efficiency.  You said,

&gt;<i> IBM chose to implement multiple Java processes in a single JVM.
</I>
	/as do we/.  I do not know how IBM implemented multiple multiple
Java processes, or if it is possible to find out.  Perhaps, since they
(AFAIK) neglected to provide a Java-side API for processes, they are
runnig disjoint JVMs in a single process; your description leads to me to
believe that they have discovered or implemented an efficient method for
sharing class definitions accross those JVMs -- could you confirm this?  
If they have, it is to the loss of the Java community that they neglected
to tell anyone else (AFAIK) how to do this.  If they did (or have released
source to their JVM), I would be very interested in reading it.

	The decision to support multiple Java processes in single JVM was
arrived at because we thought it would be easier to do such a thing than
(a) program multiple /native/ processes and then (b) implement
sufficiently advanced and efficient IPC to allow the efficiencies which
have so concerned us in our discussions.

	JNI is a specification for the interface between a native program
and (in 1.2) one our JVMs.  MPCL is a specification for the implementation
of more than one Java process in an efficient manner.  Ryan's 'os' package
is the standard (albiet informal) interface to this ability.  (That is, it
is like JNI for Java.)  MPCL, in fact, may be an option for the
implementation of JNI.  (Which would be nice, should JOS ever decide to
support JNI.)  It should not be suprising, then, that the two are similar;
however, the critical difference is precisely that MPCL defines how to
share classes.  And quite honestly, MPCL is not of general concern; Ryan's
'os' package is, because it is what everyone will be /using/.*

-_Quinn

* In fact, it ought to be possible to write code for its interface such
that it wrapped calls to a helper app which spawned a new JVM and did
whatever IPC was necessary to support the various calls available in the
interface.  If used with a JVM which supported multiple instances in a
single process, a daemon could be written to respond to Ryan's OS code and
spawn new processes with that JVM, instead.
