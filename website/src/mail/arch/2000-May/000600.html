<PRE>&gt;<i> Let's get back to the discussion. The reloading of classes cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> ignored. Each process has its own potentially unique CLASSPATH. So, each
</I>&gt;<i> process must load its own classes.
</I>
	While it's true the each process must load its own classes, it is
not because of a potentially unique CLASSPATH; it is because we cannot
share statics across processes.  CLASSPATH is not particularly relevant to
the JVM specification -- it is an implementation-dependent mechanism for
specifying the location of bytecode payloads.  Only in that those payloads
may differ must we keep them, as class definitions*, separate.

*: class definition is any way in which you may specify a class completely
enough for a JVM to execute it.

&gt;<i> All classes must be unique to a bytecode process. None can be shared
</I>&gt;<i> without a proxy.
</I>
	No classes need ever be shared to achieve object sharing.  If the
class definitions matches, the oject may be shared.  I have suggested that
the best way to handle the inevitable conflicts between statics in the
classes of shared objects is for the shared object to simply use the
statics from whichever process/PCL it's currently running in.  I think
this also holds to the principle of least suprise -- some other method
may not know the object it's operating on is shared.  (That is, the static
it gets should be the same as the static the shared object does.)

&gt;<i> Everything owned by a process is discarded when the process dies.
</I>
	This may be the useful definition of ownership I've been looking
for -- the set of things which are garbage collected when a process
terminates.  I will think about this.  (Apologies to Ryan if he said this
before and I missed it.)
