I think you mean to say that Process B cannot &quot;refer&quot; to an object
created by Process A, except by proxy (It can &quot;own&quot; it simply by
reassigning ownership as we have discussed before).

That cleared, I am unsettled by your use of the word &quot;cannot&quot;.

I don't see that proxies are required, as you are claiming them to be.
We also discussed this with Process objects which need to be shared
between processes in much the same way. In that thread, you claimed that
Process objects must also be shared via a proxy.

I have said this before, but if the project is to be successful, we need
to learn to consider two conflicting ideas long enough to compare them
equally. If I may quote myself:

&gt;&gt;<i> (if we can sustain two conflicting ideas long enough to
