This points out the problem with this approach. The JVM spec says that
an Object has a reference to exactly one java.lang.Class, and a Class
has a reference to exactly one java.lang.ClassLoader. 

&gt;<i> This is the best thing I've heard all week. We can provide a function to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;move&quot; an object from one user process to another. In other words, an
</I>&gt;<i> object can be passed to another process simply by modifying its Process
</I>&gt;<i> property.
</I>
Or more likely, by modifying the class loader reference (to a class
loader that shares the same class definition for that object). This will
be a primordial class loader, so this will provide an indirect reference
to the process if you need it.

&gt;<i> I can imagine that a DatagramPacket can be &quot;sent&quot; to another user process
</I>&gt;<i> by updating its Process property from a protocol stack to a user process.
</I>&gt;<i> Since the protocol stack no longer owns the object, it can be garbage
</I>&gt;<i> collected in the usual way.
</I>
These protocol stack optimisations do not, however, depend on changing
the ownership of an object (ie. the datagram). The datagram will still
be garbage collected when there are no more references to it.

&gt;<i> The idea of moving an object around, from process to process, is a strong
</I>&gt;<i> point of Java technologies. The same function could move an object from one
</I>&gt;<i> machine to another.
</I>
And &quot;sharing objects&quot; is an extension of this concept. Rather than
changing the owner, you can *add* an owner. Well, there are two ways you
might share an object: a) share ownership, and b) have a single owner
but share access. The latter is easier to implement and less
controversial, so we will probably do that first (down below, I point
out that they may actually both be the same thing, implementation-wise).

&gt;<i> There is only one catch. A complex object could not be moved from one
</I>&gt;<i> process to another without moving all of its dependent objects. While it
</I>&gt;<i> might be good for shallow moves, it could not be automatic for deep moves.
</I>
Although a partial move is not illegal. For example, if we only move the
root object, then it is considered to simply have a reference to an
object in another process, which we have already discussed as being ok.

&gt;<i> &gt;Sharing by proxy is another idea again. But we can share an object
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;between multiple processes and still have a single owner.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A directory entry is a proxy for a file's payload. A directory and payload
</I>&gt;<i> are separate. An object proxy is like a directory entry. A proxy is owned
</I>&gt;<i> by exactly one process. Behind the scenes, a proxy has an object property.
</I>&gt;<i> The object property always points to an object owned by the system process.
</I>
This is the approach I like, but I'd replace &quot;the system process&quot; with
&quot;a system process&quot;, sort of like a shared object broker process. So,
shared ownership can be emulated by taking ownership away all of the
participating processes and giving it to a single, independent master
process: the shared object broker.

This is not to say that processes are forced to share ownership when
sharing processes; They can still share access but retain sole ownership
(ie. the original process is taking on the responsibility of the shared
object broker for this particular object).

Also, whether or not the shared object reference is a proxy or not is a
different question.

&gt;<i> I believe a proxy will be more efficient than direct references. When the
</I>&gt;<i> Process property of each object is an item, it is very easy for the process
</I>&gt;<i> to be de-referenced. It is straight forward.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The idea of maintaining a list (see above) of processes makes it simple to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain process information but makes it difficult to de-reference. The
</I>&gt;<i> complexity is this: a process object returned from getProcessList() belongs
</I>&gt;<i> to another process. The implications of this are incomprehensible.
</I>
I think I comprehend them. :=) Let's make an analogy with Threads. One
thread has a reference to another thread running in the same process,
but when that thread terminates, the first thread still has a reference
to that thread. All that has happened is that the referenced thread has
moved into the DEAD state, and it has been removed from the scheduler.
As soon as the first thread releases its reference, the garbage (that's
what it is) can be collected.

I don't see a problem with handling references to processes in the same
way. If the referenced process exits, it moves into the DEAD state. When
a process is dead, the object does not need to be thrown away
immediately. In fact, it needs to hang around so the caller can call
java.lang.Process.exitValue().

So, I see both direct sharing and proxy sharing as useful. Proxy sharing
would be implemented on top of the primitive direct sharing
functionality.

BTW, in the case of sharing JavaProcesses, the user-space shared object
broker will probably not be the one to manage the shared instances.
JavaProcesses will probably be owned by the KernelClassLoader. Same
principle but different broker.

&gt;<i> When each object belongs to exactly one process, the implications are easy
</I>&gt;<i> to understand (easy to code) and limit the object sharing to a centralized API.
</I>
I agree that it is simpler. And shared object ownership can be emulated
by having a broker process.
