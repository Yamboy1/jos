I can't find _any_ JavaOS documentation on IBM's website any more, and
unfortunately I can't find the various documents I downloaded when they
were available. I am interested in the specific documentation you are
referring to as well (if it exists), but does anyone know where IBM's
JavaOS documentation is to be found?

Yes, this is possible. Whether or not JavaProcess is implemented as a
proxy object or a direct object is not specified. A proxy implementation
of JavaProcess would allow you to create new JVMs per process behind the
scenes.
