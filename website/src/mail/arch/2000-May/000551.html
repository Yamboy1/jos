It's the other way around, actually.

None which are granted by the kernel. The fact that it is recorded by
the kernel, though, means it can be used at the user level.

The kernel doesn't care how it is used. But garbage collection in the
kernel would benefit from smart use of object ownership by user
processes. That was my point about multiple ownership of objects. If we
emulate it the way I suggested, that helps the garbage collector - it
doesn't leave dead processes around in memory (besides, that's ugly,
conceptually).

&gt;<i>         All your points are good, but the connection to ownership
</I>&gt;<i> continues to elude me.  Why is 'ownership' a kernel-level primitive?
</I>
That's the nature of the system. An object is associated with one class,
which is associated with one defining class loader, which is associated
with one process. Therefore, objects are owned by (/associated with)
processes and that is reflected in the implementation of the
kernel(/JVM). Reassigning ownership of an object to another process is
therefore a kernel(/JVM) primative, too.
