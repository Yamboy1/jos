Not would, but could. If a process creates two objects of type A, they
both share the same class, and therefore the same statics.

If a process creates one object of type A, and obtains another object of
type A from a different process, then that object will be defined by a
different class and will therefore have different statics.

If a process obtains one object of type A from one process, and another
object of type A from another process, then each of those shared objects
will be defined by different classes (from different processes) and
therefore will have different statics. This allows a process to do IPC
with two servers without any interference.

You must have an misunderstanding. I am not interested in cutting
corners, and I believe this solution is the only solution presented so
far that _does_ meet the spec (apart from the fact that we are doing
object IPC).

Perhaps you are thinking of the case where one process creates two
objects of type A and attempts to share them individually with two other
processes. In this case, the statics are shared. It is ok (and right) to
share statics between objects that were created in the same process and
therefore defined by the same class (well, we're talking specifically
about primordial class loaders here). However, it is not ok to share
statics between objects that were created in different processes. This
causes static interference. One process should not be able to affect
another process *except* through a shared object.
