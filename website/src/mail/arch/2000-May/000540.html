Right. It so happens that ProcessClassLoader has a reference to the
process that it is loading classes for. This reference is used in
ProcessManager.getOwningProcess(clazz) which traverses up the class
loader chain until the primordial class loader is reached, then finally
calls getProcess() on it to return the process owning that class. This
is also a method which you felt should be defined at the generic level
because it would work the same for host and nativ implementations. I
think I agree.

What this means is, it sort of does matter which process owns the
object, because this reference will stop the real owner of the process
from being garbage collected if it drops out of the distributed system.

The above was actually in response to this bit.

&gt;<i> (BTW -- I really like the idea

</I>
It seems like this is the primitive for doing all sorts of stuff related
to do object ownership. For example, to emulate multiple owners of an
object, ownership of the object can be re-assigned to an independent
master process: the(/a) shared object broker.

&gt;<i>         Ownership seems to be important only if it confers privileges that
</I>&gt;<i> accessors don't have.  Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems like the
</I>&gt;<i> processes sharing the object must have equal access to it, because once
</I>&gt;<i> the object is shared, the JVM isn't going to call security again, unless
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly directed to do so.  Being able to do some things but not others
</I>&gt;<i> to an object, without those explicit security checks, also seems like it
</I>&gt;<i> would violate the spec.  What am I missing here?
</I>
Security doesn't really depend on having shared ownership, it's more to
do with designing elegant distributed systems, to avoid the problem
where the object owner drops out of the ring.

But security is an interesting topic in itself. One way of handling it
is as you said: each process that shares access to the object is
restricted in exactly the same way. But when you look at how access
restriction is implemented, you see it is possible to actually allow one
process to have more access than another. Each method which the client
process can call is able to check who the calling process is and grant
or deny access. So some methods on the object can be called by process
A, some methods can be called by process B, and some can be called by
both.
