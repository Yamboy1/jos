We haven't ignored it. It has already been discussed that each process
has its own CLASSPATH in the form of
System.getProperty(&quot;java.class.path&quot;).

Reference:

&gt;<i> All classes must be unique to a bytecode process. None can be shared
</I>&gt;<i> without a proxy.
</I>
Simple composition. Not proxy.

&gt;<i> When a Java application runs inside a MPCL-compatible virtual machine, all
</I>&gt;<i> of its classes must be discarded when a process dies.
</I>
There are two options:

1. We can discard the classes when a process dies.
2. We can just let them be discarded when there are no references to any
shared objects inside the process from outside the process (where I am
proposing that not only may there be shared objects within the
application, but the Process object itself is a shared object).

It is irrelevant for me to say which one I think is best here, just that
it is incorrect to say that the classes *must* be discarded when a
process dies. We have two options. One may be better than the other, but
we won't know unless we can consider them BOTH long enough to compare
them equally.

&gt;<i> A process can share objects with any other process, not just the process
</I>&gt;<i> that created it. For more information, see also ParentProcess article on
</I>&gt;<i> JOS Wiki.
</I>
You raise an interesting point about the effect that a hard parent link
has on garbage collection. I have not checked the POSIX standard, but
through experimentation on Linux, it appears that when the parent of a
process dies, the parent reference is automatically reassigned to the
init process (which is responsible for killing off child processes when
a runlevel exits).

&gt;<i> A versionless virtual machine is able to adapt at runtime to different
</I>&gt;<i> versions of the Java standard class libraries. The class library is plugged
</I>&gt;<i> into a versionless virtual machine through CLASSPATH. Within a single
</I>&gt;<i> virtual machine, each process is built upon a different platform. One
</I>&gt;<i> process can run Java 2 platform while another runs Java 1.
</I>
That would be nice, though maybe it requires that the JVM be carefully
written. It should be possible.
