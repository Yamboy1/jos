In this thread, I am focused on the definition a subprogram and illustrate
a subprogram through its API. If you would like to contribute to the
definition of a subprogram, please do so.

</I>
Sun Microsystems has done a fine job describing a Java application. They
have clearly defined a standard subprogram API for Java applications. Here
is how the classic JDK works:

1. The top-most program is usually a BIOS. It might always be a form of
BIOS, even when it is microcode.

2. The BIOS uses a subprogram API to launch a foreign operating system
kernel. As we have seen, the start-up sequence for an IBM PC is tedious. It
is this subprogram API which defines a boot sector format. A boot sector
wouldn't work at all without a subprogram API.

3. By whatever means necessary, an end user launches the java tool as a
kernel subprogram. It is this subprogram API which defines an executable
image format, like ELF. A java tool could not be launched without a
subprogram API.

4. The java tool creates a virtual machine. Starting with JDK 1.1.x, the
java tool uses the Java Native Interface (JNI) to run a virtual machine as
a dynamic shared library. By design, a dynamic shared library usually
shares the subprogram API of an executable image format. On Windows, the
java tool and virtual machine share a single machine code process. On
Linux, the java tool and virtual machine might share memory across many
machine code processes, one process for each Java thread.

5. In turn, the classic java tool launches a Java application as a
subprogram. By ignoring how the Java application runs inside a machine code
process, one might think the Java application is the first program running
when, in fact, it is not. Inthe classic model, a Java application is hardly
comparable to a BIOS or kernel.

&gt;<i>Now, you could say that some programs that use this API are subprograms,
</I>&gt;<i>and some are Java applications, but do you think it is right to use the
</I>&gt;<i>same API for two different types of programs*? That would be the
</I>&gt;<i>opposite of strongly typed. Personally, I don't think this API is a
</I>&gt;<i>subprogram API (which explains why I do not think subprogram APIs are
</I>&gt;<i>necessary to invoke an Application in a process)
</I>
In the context of a subprogram, all programs that use the Java application
API are subprograms. The definition of a Java application is weak. Any
class that implements static main() is-a Java application.

A subprogram is not a process. In the context of a process, it is something
like what you have said. Most Java applications are designed to run in
their own process. Others are not.

As for using the same API for two different types of programs, we have
talked about this before. When Java programmers write a subprogram, they
should have lots of base classes to choose from. Implement an interface or
extend a base class for that kind of subprogram. This is already true for
applets and servlets. It should be true for daemons, services, etc..

By implementing a well-known interface, a subprogram manager can invoke the
right environment for a subprogram automatically.

For example, the Java application API could be extended to match the
MPCL-compatible virtual machine. Any Java application that does not need a
new process could implement static main() /and/ the subprogram interface.
Then, we can safely assume that every Java application that does not
implement the subprogram interface requires a new process.

&gt;<i>{ * If you want to use it as a subprogram API for specific programs that
</I>&gt;<i>are subprograms, please do. But since Sun says that this is the API you
</I>&gt;<i>use for writing applications, it is incorrect to say a subprogram API is
</I>&gt;<i>needed to run a process. }
</I>
A foreign operating system cannot create a machine code process without a
subprogram API. A subprogram API is the defining moment in the life of a
kernel. Without a subprogram API, programmers wouldn't know how to build an
executable image. Without a subprogram API, a kernel would not know how to
fix-up an executable image or what method to invoke after the executable
image had been loaded. A subprogram API determines what method(s) will be
invoked after a new process is created.

In a C program on Linux, there is no mystery. The Linux kernel uses fork()
to &quot;load&quot; an executable. A new process/thread structure is created first,
which affects the kernel's scheduler. Then, a process/thread loads a
subprogram. When oversimplified, a new subprogram seems to load itself. The
kernel expects executables to use the ELF format, fixes up the executable
image, looks for a method called _main() and invokes it.

In contrast, a single-process operating system might create a new process
without creating a new thread. A new &quot;process&quot; is created and a subprogram
is loaded. Here, the equivalent exec() method is a blocking I/O call. The
calling process does not resume until the called process dies.

When Sun Microsystems defined the subprogram API for Java applications,
they made a few well-known assumptions.

1. With a partnership between a virtual machine and a java tool, a virtual
machine would create an environment for a Java application. The environment
of a virtual machine would be equal to the environment of a Java
application. Sun Microsystems created a rule that there must be exactly one
Java application per virtual machine. Also, Sun created a rule that there
must be exactly one primordial class loader per virtual machine.

2. A java tool would expect an arbitrary class name as a command line
parameter. Additional parameters to a java tool would be passed to the
arbitrary class as an array of strings.

3. A java tool would load the arbitrary class and look for a static main()
method. Finally, we get to the subprogram API from the Java programmer's
point of view. When oversimplified, a static main() method of an arbitrary
class is the &quot;first&quot; method invoked by the java tool.

Of course, we know that this oversimplification is not entirely true.
Behind the scenes, the &quot;static&quot; method (&lt;clinit&gt;) for every related class
would be invoked before the first statement inside static main() is invoked.

&gt;<i>Again, it is only required for your way of looking at it. To say it is
</I>&gt;<i>required, period, is to force your views upon others. And this is
</I>&gt;<i>especially unfortunate when you claim someone else's project as a
</I>&gt;<i>dead-end project (ie. that rheise.os can never become a &quot;genuine&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>bytecode process) simply because it does not meet &quot;your&quot; requirements.
</I>
Something is required. Something must sit between a process and an
arbitrary subprogram. What else would you have us call it? How would you
explain it? The purpose of this thread is to define it. We need to define
it well enough so that when a programmer writes a JOS-compatible
subprogram, it will run on any implementation of JOS.

Across 50+ years, from the earliest work in machine code to extreme
object-oriented programming of today, &quot;program&quot; and &quot;subprograms&quot; have
become widely accepted terms. Most of the time, precision is not required
and they are used interchangeably. In a &quot;kind-of&quot; relationship, a program
is a kind of subprogram. A Java application is a kind-of program, which is
a kind-of subprogram.

In a structural relationship, a subprogram is &quot;part of&quot; a program. In turn,
that program, as a subprogram, is part of some other program.

A Java application is a subprogram, typically part of a virtual machine. In
turn, a virtual machine is a subprogram, typically part of a java tool. In
turn, a java tool is a subprogram, typically part of a machine code
process. In turn, a machine code process is a subprogram, typically part of
an OS kernel.

A Java applet is a subprogram, typically part of a virtual machine. In
turn, a virtual machine is a subprogram, typically part of a HTML browser.
In turn, an HTML browser is a subprogram, typically part of a machine code
process. In turn, a machine code process is a subprogram, typically part of
an OS kernel.

A Java servlet is a subprogram, typically part of a virtual machine. In
turn, a virtual machine is a subprogram, typically part of an HTTP service.
In turn, an HTTP service is a subprogram, typically part of a machine code
process. In turn, a machine code process is a subprogram, typically part of
an OS kernel.

Now, the structural relationship between a program and subprogram are often
recursive. In theory, a virtual machine simulator and/or prototype can be
written in bytecode. Hang on. It gets weird.

If I write one virtual machine (MC) in machine code and another virtual
machine (BC) in bytecode, I can use MC to invoke BC. In turn, since BC is
written in bytecode, BC can invoke another instance of BC. And so on.

&gt;<i>I did not consider it important that I support the calling of any
</I>&gt;<i>method, not just main, because Sun tells us that the standard way to do
</I>&gt;<i>it is the &quot;main&quot; method.
</I>
Sun Microsystems describes how their java tool works. It is a standard way
for a tool called &quot;java&quot; to work.

Within the Java Native Interface Specification, Sun describes this as an
important feature of JNI: the ability to define any method of any class as
the starting point of your JNI-compatible program. Most importantly, this
method does not have to be static.

&gt;<i>I can allow the name of the method to be invoked to be passed in, but
</I>&gt;<i>maybe you can give useful examples of this before I implement it.
</I>
There are plenty of examples shown on this mailing list and JOS Wiki. Here
are my favorites.

1. java.lang.Runnable. The simplest instance method for a Java subprogram
is run(). Run is a blocking call. Any class that implements the Runnable
interface can be arbitrarily invoked as a subprogram. In the Java
programming language, it is something like this:

  public void example( String className ) {
    Runnable r = Class.forName( className ).newInstance();
    r.run();
  }

2. java.lang.Component. In a extensive library of components, any class
that extends Component can be arbitrarily invoked as a subprogram. In the
Java programming language, it is something like this:

  public void example( String className ) {
    Component c = Class.forName( className ).newInstance();
    if ( c instanceof Applet ) {
      ShowApplet( (Applet) c );
      return;
    }
    if ( c instanceof Window ) {
      ((Window) c).show();
      return;
    }

    :

    ShowComponent( c );
  }

3. The classes in my subprogram APIs have been explicitly designed with
subprograms in mind. My subprogram APIs has been plugged into the Smart
API, so that any shell can invoke many different kind of subprograms,
including foreign OS subprograms and Java applications. All this and more
is documented on the Smart API pages of JOS Wiki.

A subprogram is not a process. A subprogram API is separate from a process
API, and should be. Subprogram APIs can be used even without new threads,
new class loaders and a new virtual machine.

A process API should create a process first and then invoke any arbitrary
subprogram. A process API should use a subprogram API to invoke any kind of
subprogram once a process has been created. It is my goal to define a
subprogram and sometimes contrast a subprogram and process.

Here are examples of what I would like to do with a process:

  public void example() {
    Runtime.exec( &quot;jrew -classpath ~/debug:$CLASSPATH MyApp&quot; );
    Runtime.exec( &quot;java.awt.Button&quot; );
    Runtime.exec( &quot;MyCustomApplet height=10 width=60&quot; );
    Runtime.exec( &quot;<A HREF="http://www.jos.org/"">http://www.jos.org/&quot;</A> );
    Runtime.exec( &quot;<A HREF="ftp://mindspring.com/"">ftp://mindspring.com/&quot;</A> );
  }

Runtime.exec() might always create a new bytecode process and pass a
command line (a string) to the new process. A &quot;command line&quot; can load any
kind of arbitrary subprogram. When oversimplified, a subprogram would seem
to load itself.
