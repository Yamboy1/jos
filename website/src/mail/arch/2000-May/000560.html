Another interesting point. If we share class definitions without caring
which version of the superclass is being loaded (as we have apparently
been discussing), then the class definitions need tack on the
superclasses with the static data.

On the other hand, if we include the superclass pointers with the class
definition, we are saying that a class definition may only be shared
between two classes if their superclasses also share class definitions.
And if we do this, we don't have to worry about checking that
superclasses match when performing illegal casts.

However, if we do this, we don't get to share class definitions when the
superclasses are different versions. BUT, as I pointed out in my last
email, it is very rarely the case that the superclasses will be
different (the inheritance chain would have to go through a number of
different archives to even allow the possibility). So, my vote is for
keeping superclass pointers with the class definition. This allows us to
do illegal cast checks the way you wanted (ie. the &quot;most correct&quot; way)
at minimal computational expense.

&gt;<i> 2. If we only allow illegal casts with classes loaded by the primordial
</I>&gt;<i> class loader, then all we need to check is if the two class instances
</I>&gt;<i> indeed were loaded by that class loader, and have the same name, since
</I>&gt;<i> class loaders should only allow one class instance per class name.
</I>
Note that there are multiple primordial class loaders: one per process.
If you are only considering a single primordial class loader, you are in
fact talking about &quot;legal&quot; casts, not &quot;illegal&quot; casts. &quot;Illegal&quot; casts
refers to casts between processes.

{{ BTW, Matt, you seem to be CC'ing the admin list automatically. Is
this something to do with your mail client? }}
