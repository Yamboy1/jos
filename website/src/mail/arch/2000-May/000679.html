There are some differences. Consider that object sharing is intended as
a means of collaboration between two or more processes. In the OO sense,
the ultimate in collaboration is the interaction between objects (where
an object groups methods and data). Unfortunately, serialization focuses
only on the data part of an object, and is therefore closer to message
passing where you can pass data objects between two processes by
serializing them. Once an object is deserialized, invoking a method on
it does not allow you to interact with the other process, it only allows
you to access or operate on the data that was sent to you.

This doesn't mean message passing hasn't been proven to be useful. It
has. But in an object-oriented operating system we can aim much higher.

That said, you're right in that serialization may give us some
perspective on the matter. The interesting thing is what to do with
statics and method calls. Serialization means to restrict the full use
of statics and method calls, focussing only on the data in the object.
As a result, we have message passing. Interestingly, we found exactly
the same restrictions in the discussion on how to resolve symbolic
references in true shared objects (in the case that we use the class
loader of the calling thread). More interestingly, in both cases this
restriction occurred because we were trying to pretend that the shared
object belonged to the borrowing process.

There are typically two ways to overcome these restrictions. One is
through direct sharing (with proper object ownership), and the other is
through proxies (RMI uses proxies to provide &quot;almost&quot; complete method
interaction support across processes, and serialization to pass data
arguments to those methods, although RMI could use direct sharing as
well (on a single machine) if we implemented that as a primitive in the
operating system (*) ).

Both direct sharing and proxies have advantages. In terms of elegance,
direct sharing allows true object interaction, meaning that standard OO
programming techniques are not affected in any way. Proxies can provide
a solution that looks &quot;close&quot; to true object interaction, but anyone who
has used RMI will have noticed certain visible difference with proxies
that are hard to ignore.

On the other hand, proxies provide an easy way to deal with process
termination and cleanup because processes are completely separated from
each other. This is not to say that cleanup after termination cannot be
done with a direct sharing model (I have several incomplete ideas), but
proxies certainly provide a way not to have to deal with the problem at
all.

I don't want to discourage further research on proxies, but I should at
least make those interested aware of some of the issues I found when I
was researching proxies.

Simply adding a level of indirection (like weak references) is not
sufficient to ensure that processes remain separate. So things like this
won't work:

class SharedObject
	{
	Object get();
	void put(Object o);
	}

This would work if the client always called
sharedObject.get().someMethod() to maintain the indirection, but a
programmer can always call sharedObject.get() and keep a hold of the
value.

What we can conclude from this is that for proxies to work, the client
process MUST NOT be able to obtain a reference to the real object in the
server process. This means that a proxy class must redefine all the
public methods of the real class, and have them forward method
invocations to the corresponding object in the server process. This is
what RMI does, although it makes it easier by providing a compiler that
can generate the proxy classes for you. It is conceivable that such
proxies could even be generated at runtime in our case by constructing
the byte array on the fly according to the class file format, and
defining a runtime class from it. Still, you have the same problem with
method arguments that you do with RMI. If you serialize them, it does
the client no good if the server updates the state of the method
argument objects. If you want complete object-oriented style
interaction, you need to even generate proxies for these method
arguments.

Since about a month ago, I diverted my attention to using direct object
sharing instead. It has its own share of issues, but they are more
subtle. Restricting access to shared objects is fairly easy to deal
with. Process cleanup is quite complicated (note that the host
implementation of rheise.os intentionally handles process cleanup the
wrong way because it cannot do it the right way. This not a problem with
my design - the native implementation will do things the/a right way).
The more difficult issue has to do a process not being able to be
cleaned up and garbage collected until all other processes let go of its
shared objects. One approach which I have already mentioned is to
reassign ownership of shared objects to a third party (a shared object
broker) so that the initial process can terminate freely. There are also
subtle issues with this (which I think I may have worked out, but I'm
still thinking on it), but my latest thoughts lead me to believe that a
third party may not be required at all (although it would be a good
design choice in many applications).

I hope now I have made clear that proxies are not required, or at least
they have not been proven to be required yet. There are many issues
surrounding shared objects, but there is much to be gained from them if
we can overcome these issues, and that means being able to consider
possibilities that at first seem impossible.

(*) since the behaviour of such an implementation of RMI would be
different from a proxy based one (it would allow you to do more things),
the side effects should probably be clearly documented for that
implementation, ie. you get faster object sharing, but remember that
this is real object interaction - clients are not dealing with a copy,
they are dealing with the real thing. While normal software applications
are designed with this in mind, existing RMI applications might not be.
