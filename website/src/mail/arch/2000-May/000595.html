I agree with Gilbert that it is not yet a standard. It is more a
proposal and an implementation of that proposal.

&gt;<i> Give me something I can use. I can't use rheise.os. Running a Java
</I>&gt;<i> application as a subprogram is not equivalent to running a Java application
</I>&gt;<i> as a process.
</I>
Sorry, but I will not give you something you can use for running your
subprograms. You can do that. rheise.os was not designed to provide that
functionality because subprograms are outside the process framework.

You could be a little less demanding and a little more supportive if you
ask me...

&gt;<i> If we think of ourselves as finished, we will miss the
</I>&gt;<i> greatest opportunity to find the best solution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, a process has no concept of a parent. There is no parent
</I>&gt;<i> property inside a process. Only a subprogram has a parent. Only a
</I>&gt;<i> subprogram can share real objects with its parent.
</I>
- POSIX compliant operating systems have the concept of parent processes
(however, this does not imply anything about object sharing).

- In the process model _Quinn and I have been proposing, any two
processes can share objects independently of parent-child relationships
(ie. a superset)

Given the above object sharing model as a primitive, subprograms can
only be appropriate if it makes sense to run a program in the same
namespace as the parent. Sharing the parent namespace can be desirable
in some instances. However, subprograms are only one way to achieve
this. There are two ways that I know of:

1. subprograms, which are procedural based, and
2. subobjects, which are object-oriented based

Which one a programmer prefers is a matter of taste. For example, I
would always* choose (2) over (1), but others may choose the exact
opposite. Therefore, I do not consider either way a primitive in
rheise.os. Objects themselves are a primitive because this is an
object-oriented operating system, but I do not assume which way a
programmer wishes to run sub-code in-process. That is an application
design issue, and we application writers all come from different design
backgrounds.

(*) I like the object-oriented paradigm.

&gt;<i> And, a basic process has no concept of a user. There is no user property
</I>&gt;<i> inside a process. Only a multiple user operating system has a user.
</I>
I have assumed that this is the general direction of operating systems*,
so I built users into the rheise.os model. In fact, the user model was
the prime motivation for starting rheise.os. It turned out later that my
work would be a useful starting point for multiple processes, enabling
higher level JOS developers to contribute something to the project.

(*) In fact the Java specification already relates users to processes
(assuming a JVM instance is a process). A Java process may obtain its
user by reading the user.name system property. This is obviously very
basic at the moment, but their future plans are available at
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/security/spec/security-spec.doc8.html#21605">http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/security/spec/security-spec.doc8.html#21605</A>

&gt;<i> The rheise.os product demonstrates many different ideas at the same time.
</I>&gt;<i> It is not focused on the bare essentials of creating a bytecode process. We
</I>&gt;<i> need a focused, bare essential demonstration of a bytecode process.
</I>
I find I can make better design decisions when I consider how one system
interacts with another, especially when they are interrelated. Consider
the current package structure (with the exclusion of jos.system):

jos
 + process
 + user
 + security

And consider some of the dependencies I have modeled:

- process  -&gt; user
- security -&gt; user
- process  -&gt; security 

(where -&gt; means &quot;depends on&quot;)

What I am trying to work out now is the best API for these packages. I
am still not happy with the current API and I am constantly changing it.
If you don't consider how these three systems interact, you will never
arrive at the best solution.

Right now, the process package works well. It is now a matter of API
refinement. The fundamental functionality is in place. I just need to
work out where methods should go and what they should be named.

True, some methods are unimplemented or commented out (or un-thought of)
but they don't seem to be fundamental. This means I can turn my
attention to them later, AFTER I give the user and security packages
their fair share of attention. If you think the process package alone
needs more focus, that will require additional man power since I would
like to make progress in all three packages simultaneously. Rather than
criticising rheise.os for lack of effort in one particular area, why not
help increase the man power and give the process package the amount of
focus you think it needs?

&gt;<i> We need to create a better test. The test of a genuine bytecode process is
</I>&gt;<i> not, as others have said, piping the output from one process to another.
</I>&gt;<i> The acid test is far more complicated than that. Piping from one Java
</I>&gt;<i> application to another doesn't prove much.
</I>
I have been working on test cases for rheise.os which demonstrate all
the functionality it provides. They are intended to demonstrate that
processes behave correctly, among other things. The test cases are
incomplete, though. Maybe you could specify the perfect test cases I
should implement? The pipe test alone is a pretty good test because it
demonstrates separate namespaces, the main distinction between plain
threads and processes. But I have other test cases to demonstrate
System.exit() and process.waitFor(). I would welcome your contributions
here (and anywhere else).

&gt;<i> Don't be distracted by rheise.os. It is only a small step along a path that
</I>&gt;<i> will lead us to a genuine bytecode process.
</I>
Ok everyone, sorry for distracting you. It was a good try though, don't
you think? You see, rheise.os is not what I pretended it to be. I tried
to make it &quot;appear&quot; as though rheise.os was cleanly designed, and you
fell for it! Now, as Gilbert said, it's time to move on, because
rheise.os (the joke that it is) will never make it as a genuine bytecode
process model. How can it... possibly? I mean, come on! What, with all
the problems Gilbert pointed out which couldn't possibly be fixed, even
if Gilbert himself helped.

If I were actually serious about rheise.os I'd probably be really
discouraged, but that not being the case, I have to laugh at you. Hah!
(suckers :-)

&lt;/sarcasm&gt;

PS. is rheise.os really a dead-end project?

&gt;<i> Examine the following code. What should happen?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> // Demo.java
</I>&gt;<i> public class Demo1 {
</I>&gt;<i>   public static void main( String[] args ) {
</I>&gt;<i>     String cmd = &quot;java Demo2&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i>     Runtime.getRuntime().exec( cmd );
</I>&gt;<i>     System.exit( 0 );
</I>&gt;<i>   }
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If Demo2 defines a static main() method, it must continue running long
</I>&gt;<i> after Demo1 is gone. Demo2 is not accidentally destroyed when a Demo1
</I>&gt;<i> invokes System.exit().
</I>
I agree. This is in fact how rheise.os behaves.

&gt;<i> The java.lang.Process object is always a proxy to
</I>&gt;<i> the real process that's running.
</I>
Incorrect. rheise.os proves that a proxy is not necessary.
java.lang.Process does not reflect the need for a proxy, nor does
jos.process.JavaProcess which is a direct subclass.

Of course, in the bridge between the Java layer and the native JVM,
there will need to be some natively usable representation of a
JavaProcess. It doesn't matter to me what that representation is.
Regardless of how the JVM represents it internally, it is quite possible
to represent each process in the Java layer by unique instances of the
JavaProcess class. There is no need to create a proxy of a process in
each process that wishes to reference it, except in the intermediate
stages of getting JOS working before shared object IPC exists.

Evidence suggests that the more common way to do this in Java is through
references to unique instances, not proxies. For example, references to
instances of all of these classes refer to unique instances:

        java.lang.Thread
        java.lang.Class
        java.lang.ClassLoader
        java.lang.Object

Granted, Process is different because we are talking about referencing
it from different processes which are typically meant to be in separate
memory spaces, but with shared object IPC, we are not forced to use
proxies. We can do it either way. I like the direct approach, because
that is the goal of shared object IPC: to allow one process to interact
directly with another process - in the most direct way possible. For
example:

Process otherProcess = getSomeOtherProcess();
otherProcess.destroy(); // may throw SecurityException
