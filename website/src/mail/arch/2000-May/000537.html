You do realise that the URL cache is based on the same principles I have
been pushing all along for class loading efficiency? That is, location
(the URL reference itself), and *optionally* the last modified date
which it discovers when it reads the first few bytes from the socket
(it's the first line in the header for efficiency).

I'm glad you see the benefits of this algorithm, if only at the URL
cache level. It's the same algorithm used by the filesystem cache too
(except in this case, the version information is *not* optional), and
I'm sure you see the benefit here too. I am proposing that we use the
same algorithm for determining whether a class definition is already in
decaf's cache.

You're point was, why bother when we can implement an optimisation at a
lower level (disk and url cache) which benefits all upper layers? My
answer is the same answer to a similar question you had about optimising
the protocol stack to benefit all implementations of IPC in the upper
layers. We have the potential to make things *much* faster. The lower
level optimisations (eg. disk cache) will still be beneficial to all
upper layers, but both direct object sharing and internal location/date
checking (inside findSystemClass()) provide significant *additional*
speed improvements for the parts of the system that use it.
