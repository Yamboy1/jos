<PRE>&gt;<i> disturbing ways. For example, Process A calls System.setOut(logFile),
</I>&gt;<i> and Process B all of a sudden loses its output to some unknown place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are at least 114 non-final statics in the JDK 1.1 system classes.
</I>&gt;<i> Per package, they are distributed as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [ note: there are certainly more to be found with a smarter algorithm ]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> applet          0
</I>&gt;<i> util            20
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
&gt;<i> You would need to check each one to make sure that one process cannot
</I>&gt;<i> interfere with another process through manipulation of these statics. 
</I>
A quick and dirty optimisation might be to share classes that have no
static variables (don't know how many of those there are).

&gt;<i> is possible to work around some of them in this case, but not all of
</I>&gt;<i> them. For example, System.in/out/err can be protected by simply sharing
</I>&gt;<i> all system classes except for java.lang.System, causing each process to
</I>&gt;<i> have their own java.lang.System statics. However, I was lucky* to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to do that in this instance because java.lang.System is a purely
</I>&gt;<i> static class (there can be no references to instances of that class). If
</I>&gt;<i> instances can be passed around, you will not be able to cast the
</I>&gt;<i> instance of the per process class to the type that a primordially loaded
</I>&gt;<i> class would expect (it can only expect one type, not n different types
</I>&gt;<i> for however many processes there are). Did that make sense? I may have
</I>&gt;<i> left out a few crucial sentences that I thought rather than wrote...
</I>
No I understand exactly what you mean.
 
&gt;<i> (*) I actually support a host implementation of rheise.os that works
</I>&gt;<i> pretty much as you desired, and it attempts to work around the static
</I>&gt;<i> problems on a case by case basis. Of course it is not (and cannot) be
</I>&gt;<i> perfect, but it works well enough to be used until the native
</I>&gt;<i> implementation is integrated with decaf. If you want to take a look at
</I>&gt;<i> it, goto <A HREF="http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/projects/rheise.os/">http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/projects/rheise.os/</A>
</I>
Will have a look.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In addition to computational efficiency, class definition sharing (which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is based on class definition caching) minimises memory waste.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes class definition caching will certainly help, although I don't see how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it has much advantage over a conventional file cache.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What is definition sharing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That was discussed in those two links I referred you to in the last
</I>&gt;<i> email. Class definition caching is the new term I just invented to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> conflict with alternative ideas that do not depend on caching in the
</I>&gt;<i> same way I do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I depend on class definition caching to avoid doing I/O twice when
</I>&gt;<i> findSystemClass(&quot;java.awt.Button&quot;) is called twice. If the modification
</I>&gt;<i> date of the archive hasn't changed, I simply use the class definition in
</I>&gt;<i> the cache and skip the InputStream.read() and much of the
</I>&gt;<i> ClassLoader.defineClass() process. This is a performance optimisation.
</I>
Ok I see. But I think you have to be careful. A cache will make sure it
doesn't hold unneeded stuff in memory. If you duplicate the cache (the
file cache and your own 'cache'), you might end up not using available
memory optimally (you will duplicate info in both caches).
 
&gt;<i> Class definition sharing, on the other hand, is a memory optimisation,
</I>&gt;<i> and a crucial part of my proposal with respect to IPC:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="http://jos.org/pipermail/arch/2000-April/000449.html">http://jos.org/pipermail/arch/2000-April/000449.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Class definition sharing simply means that if java.awt.Button.class is
</I>&gt;<i> loaded twice into two separate processes, they both (ie. the
</I>&gt;<i> java.lang.Class objects) can point to the common class definition
</I>&gt;<i> structure rather than have their own copy of the data (_Quinn's
</I>&gt;<i> insight). So, there end up being two java.lang.Class objects with
</I>&gt;<i> references to the same class definition object.
</I>
I don't quite understand. Each process will have an internal class
definition (a C or C++ structure) with a pointer to the java.lang.Class
object. These will be in different heaps. What exactly will the two
java.lang.Class objects be sharing?
 
&gt;<i> The way I take advantage of this for IPC is, I allow an object to be
</I>&gt;<i> casted from one java.awt.Button to another java.awt.Button if those two
</I>&gt;<i> classes share the same class definition (and if the two classes were
</I>&gt;<i> loaded by primordial class loaders, which is implied in my specific
</I>&gt;<i> proposal). It is difficult to grasp the implications of this, but it is
</I>&gt;<i> explained in detail in the proposal above (some details are yet to be
</I>&gt;<i> added, _Quinn has written a more recent analysis of what are the
</I>&gt;<i> necessary &quot;properties&quot; of such a system and I haven't updated my
</I>&gt;<i> proposal to explain how they might fit in yet)
</I>
Ok, so is the &quot;class definition&quot; separated from the static variables for
that class?


&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; We can only wait and see if it actually works - I suspect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; the performance will be significantly faster than a standard JVM.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not really. If the file system is already caching the .class files, how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will your method be much faster?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, particularly with jar files (which is where most classes will be
</I>&gt;<i> loaded from). You are asking why we need a class definition cache in
</I>&gt;<i> addition to a file cache. Besides the fact that it is just as easy to
</I>&gt;<i> implement, a class definition cache saves us from:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - reading the class file from a stream. Even if the file is cached, we
</I>&gt;<i> must loop over all the bytes via a stream (with memory as its source
</I>&gt;<i> rather than disk).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - interpreting the jar file. Even if the jar file is cached, we must
</I>&gt;<i> find the class file within it.
</I>
Ok these two I understand.
 
&gt;<i> - interpreting the class file. This means converting the class file
</I>&gt;<i> format into a class definition structure.
</I>
This one bothers me. You're saying that you can cache the class definition
structure. But the class definition structure points to other classes,
which may have to be loaded. (Possibly by different class loaders?). 

It's difficult to explain, but basically when you create the class
definition structure, you're loading a whole lot of other stuff and thus
creating dependencies. How do we now the dependencies are valid for the
next time that the definition is used?

This isn't clear in my mind, but do you see what I'm getting at?
 
&gt;<i> &gt; But you shouldn't be comparing to a normal JVM, you should be comparing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the native operating environment of other OS'es. Can we compete against
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the processes in BeOS, UNIX and Win32?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In that case, it is VERY important that we do class definition caching
</I>&gt;<i> in addition to file system caching :-) 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Will our solution be able to cope when the user starts compiling the whole
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; class library and spawns hundreds of processes in quick succession?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Spawning hundreds of processes in quick succession doesn't sound like
</I>&gt;<i> the right way to get a job done to me. In UNIX the program was the item
</I>&gt;<i> of reuse, so lots of programs would be spawned in quick succession to
</I>&gt;<i> get a job done. But in an object oriented operating system, objects are
</I>&gt;<i> the items of reuse, and they usually interact with eachother in the same
</I>&gt;<i> address space.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this example, it doesn't sound like a good idea to spawn hundreds of
</I>&gt;<i> separate javac processes one after another. It turns out IDE designers
</I>&gt;<i> don't think so either (not just for exec latency though, mainly for
</I>&gt;<i> opportunities for optimisation w.r.t. inter-class dependencies). I would
</I>&gt;<i> prefer to think of the java compiler as a reusable library/package that
</I>&gt;<i> can be used in a number of different contexts, eg. an IDE (so it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> have to spawn hundreds of separate processes), or your own personal
</I>&gt;<i> compilation macro or Makefile equivalent which can make use of the java
</I>&gt;<i> compiler without having to spawn processes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All that theory aside, javac can still be executed as a process if you
</I>&gt;<i> wish, and you should get good performance with
</I>&gt;<i> JavaProcess.reuseClassDefinitions() or maybe even without. Let's wait
</I>&gt;<i> and see.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (An additional note, interaction between 'ls', 'grep' and 'wc' does not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; necessarily need to involve multiple processes. The equivalent of this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in an object oriented context might be the interaction of Java beans
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; which need not be in separate processes. In this case, the same class
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; loader is used and the resolution process is not an issue)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, but if our Processes are emulating what an application expects when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it runs on a normal JVM, then programmers are going to write to this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specification. They are going to expect pipes, their own copy of static
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; variables for all classes they are using and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I meant was, the 'ls', 'grep' and 'wc' could be rewritten in an
</I>&gt;<i> object-oriented context so that they can interact as reusable objects in
</I>&gt;<i> the same address space. rheise.os still supports processes in all their
</I>&gt;<i> glory. If you wish to write 'ls' as a program that runs in its own
</I>&gt;<i> process, it will get its own version of System.in/out/err and it will be
</I>&gt;<i> able to do pipes. If you download rheise.os, there is an example that
</I>&gt;<i> shows one process piping its output into the input of another.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps it isn't such a good thing to model the traditional UNIX process
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so closely?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is certainly no need to use processes in the same way UNIX forced
</I>&gt;<i> programmers to, but we can nevertheless support the basic process model
</I>&gt;<i> since it is the foundation for many different uses. You can look at a
</I>&gt;<i> process as a perimeter around executing code that should not be able to
</I>&gt;<i> interfere with, or be interfered by, anything else. Objects that work
</I>&gt;<i> together to achieve a goal can go in the same process*.
</I>
Ok, agreed and understood.

Doesn't this imply that we should start thinking about new constructs that
might be useful to the programmer. We've implemented the Process for
backwards compatibility (and its useful properties), but we should offer
an alternative so that programmers don't gravitate to this model
automatically.

It could be that Java itself provides programmers with natural constructs
/ paradigms / patterns to use instead of Processes, but maybe we should
just highlight them and see how a typical application program is going to
use JOS.

For example, where a traditional FTP daemon might spawn processes to
service requests, a Java one would naturally create threads.

But undex UNIX the kernel allows you to control the resources used by that
process, to account for how much CPU time it has used etc. 

Do we have an analogue in JOS, do we need one?
