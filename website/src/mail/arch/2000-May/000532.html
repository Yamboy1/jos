<PRE>&gt;<i> Proxies are not required to do this (as I explained in response to
</I>&gt;<i> Gilbert's email). JavaProcesses would still be owned by the system, but
</I>&gt;<i> access does not need to be through proxy (in fact, this is the way I've
</I>&gt;<i> currently implemented it in rheise.os).
</I>
	What the pid idea does is create an implicit proxy for us, so that
we can have JavaProcesses without having to develop an object-sharing
infrastructure, and the same with sockets.  What I intended here, and
perhaps explained poorly, is that JoeApplication won't be able to tell the
difference between a JavaProcess shared object and a JavaProcess wrapping
a pid; the interface and results are identical.  It's an expedient so, if
we choose to, we can implement Java Processes before we implement object
sharing.  Likewise with Sockets, except, of course, we're re-writing
(actually, I'm pretty sure it will be adjusting, because even Windows uses
UNIX socket semantics, and hence magic numbers  -- the last time I
checked) the SocketImpl code that the Socket uses.

	At any rate, my guess is we'll be done hammering out the spec long
before I get to programming it...
