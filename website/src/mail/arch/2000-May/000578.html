<PRE>This is prerelease 4 of rheise.os-0.1.4. I haven't had time to put
together a proper release, but at least you can try out the new
functionality I've been working on:

	<A HREF="http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/projects/rheise.os/">http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/projects/rheise.os/</A>

The main changes in this release are:

	- Packages renamed to jos.*
	- SwingToolkit more usable.
	- Preliminary JDK 1.2 support.

Windows is still an issue. I don't have a copy of Windows so I am unable
to test it. I have heard that there are various security exceptions that
get thrown because I'm doing evil things, but I believe that can be
fixed by editing the security policy file for your JVM. If not, there is
probably another way to get it to work.

A few things to notice: in graphics mode, the shell program runs inside
a graphical terminal program called GTerm (like xterm). It's very basic
- no scrollbar yet, and the delete key actually, inserts a delete
character, but it basically works. Also note that shell commands can now
be followed by a '&amp;' to run a command in the background. Since you will
have downloaded JTA, you may as well try running de.mud.jta.Main
&lt;hostname&gt; to test running the telnet app from inside SwingToolkit.

BTW, thanks to everybody who suggested new names for rheise.os. I
haven't decided which one I'll go with yet, but I will eventually.

Here is the full change-log for this release:

 - Renamed rheise.os.* to jos.*
 - Renamed rheise.os.impl.* to josp.* (jos-private)
 - JavaProcess.waitFor() skips daemon threads.
 - JavaProcess.waitForAll() includes daemon threads.
 - JavaProcess.destroy() implemented using ProcessDeath.
 - All processes are added to the root thread group.
 - HostProcessClassLoader works with jars and zips.
 - Implemented a simple archive cache for class loading efficiency.
 - HostInit is now a process spawned by HostBoot.
 - HostBoot provides a -g option to enable graphics mode.
 - Standard awt.toolkit no longer supported (must use SwingToolkit).
 - SecurityManager delegator is no longer set (interferes with menus).
 - Provided hook to allow SwingToolkit to clean up after process dies.
 - Fixed System.exit() so it works from within AWT Thread.
 - JDK 1.2/Linux works in text mode.
 - Introduced jos.system package (includes shutdown() method).
