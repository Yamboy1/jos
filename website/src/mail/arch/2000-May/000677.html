<PRE>Hey guys,

I've followed some of your discussion on sharing objects and the
implications of static fields.  For perspective, one might look at
Serialization, which is, in a way, a method of sharing
objects.  Serialization disregards all static and transient fields of an
object.  This prevents the serialized object from changing the static
fields of other instances when it is deserialized.  So shared objects
could basically have their static fields dependent on the current
process.  This essentially treats shared objects as deserialized objects.

How one gets an instance of a shared object is another story. IMO, the
most elegant way is through an object broker of some kind (whether an ORB
or subscription of some kind).  That way, the broker could manage the
sharing and synchronization problems. The broker could exist outside of
&quot;processes&quot; per se, and could be accessed through JNDI or some other
interface.  I don't know if these last comments apply, they're just some
random speculation on my part.  Since I am not intimately familiar with
the kernel and VM, I cannot make a precise judgement.
