Ok, so you are only planning to put vm-specific classes in this image?

</I>&gt;<i> Each virtual machine must implement some kind of primordial class loader.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Java application. 
</I>
Ok, there is a big difference between the vm-specific classes and the
class library. The class library (including swing, database extensions etc
etc) could run into multiple megabytes, in which case it would definitely
not belong in that image. 

&gt;<i>Compared to other virtual machines, it is more difficult

</I>&gt;<i> is certainly not desireable to load vm-specific classes through CLASSPATH.
</I>
I agree with you. The only problem is that you are wasting some space. You
are keeping the bytecode in the image (which is loaded into memory), and
then you are going to build the internal class structure (which will have
a copy of the bytecode again, and the results of resolving the constant
pool). The intial raw class data is going to stay in memory &quot;forever&quot; but
it is only needed for a short period of time (at startup).

&gt;<i> In addition, an executable image is always read-only. There is a critical
</I>&gt;<i> advantage in letting a virtual memory manager know what is read-only versus
</I>&gt;<i> read-write. Bytecode is read-only, too. 
</I>
I don't see where this is really an advantage. Once you you've loaded,
linked and resolved a class you don't need the bytecode anymore. You can
flag the actual method code to be interpreted as read-only anyway.

&gt;<i> Using bytecode as a resource in
</I>&gt;<i> DATA segment reduces the footprint of a virtual machine at runtime.
</I>
This doesn't follow.

I'm assuming the whole image gets loaded into memory before execution, and
also stays there until parts get paged out. In this case it makes sense to
have the image as small as possible.

&gt;<i> If that were not enough, it is possible to reduce the size of a virtual
</I>&gt;<i> machine further. This enables a file subsystem to be written in bytecode
</I>&gt;<i> and then used to load the rest of the standard class library -- as needed
</I>&gt;<i> -- from a local storage device. Elsewhere, the rest of the standard class
</I>&gt;<i> library can be downloaded -- as needed -- across a network.
</I>
This is a very elegant approach. Writing the file-system reader in Java
(as opposed to C/C++) and having it available immediately on startup. 

Another way of doing this would be to compile that file-system reader to
native-code (assuming you have the tools to do this), and then just
firing off that to load whatever is needed from disk to get the VM going.
