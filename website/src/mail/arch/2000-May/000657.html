<PRE>	JJOS is a kernel written to support decaf; AFAIK, JJOS and decaf
are the only (JOS) active projects of their types (kernel &amp; JVM).  I will
use an extant (open source/free software) class library with
decaf; maybe classpath, maybe not.  (I have yet to get classpath to work,
so...)  I can't speak for anything at a higher level than this,
though.  The question of what is JOS? is a difficult one to answer, for
the same reasons it is sometimes unclear what the answer to what is
Linux?  Linux is a kernel; many people also refer to distributions
including the Linux kernel (and almost always, GNU software) as 'Linux' as
well.  (This is where the demand to use the name GNU/Linux comes
from.)  Similarly, JOS could be as little as JOSCore and whatever happens
to be necessary to run it, or as much as a full distribution, much of
whose software will have been written by or for the JOS project.
