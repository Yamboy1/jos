When you don't understand why someone needs to spawn hundreds of processes,
you should ask questions. They are likely to either (1) have a very good
reason, or (2) not know of any other way.

An operating system needs to help all kinds of people get their work done.
Each person is unique and has custom requirements. The right way for some
might be to spawn hundreds of processes. The right way for others might be
to run one process at a time. An operating system should be able to do
either one efficiently and effectively. The choice up to other people.

At start-up, an operating system might spawn quite a few processes. Maybe
or maybe not &quot;hundreds&quot;. System configuration determines how many and which
ones. A process might be used for some device drivers. A device driver can
be launched as a subprogram or process. A device driver that needs its own
process should run in its own process. If a file subsystem or JEPS or JADE
needs its own process, it should run in its own process.

A process might be used for each system service, like the classic system
services on Linux. FTP and HTTP might not run in the same process. Killing
FTP shouldn't kill HTTP. To upgrade a service, you should not be required
to restart a virtual machine.

Many processes on a laptop, desktop and server system sounds like the right
thing to do. It doesn't make sense to me to develop a multiple-process
operating system and then encourage people not to use its multiple-process
features.
