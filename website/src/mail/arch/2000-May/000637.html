And when I do understand why someone needs to spawn hundreds of
processes, I give an interesting theory on the use of processes in an
object oriented operating system.

Yours and my statements are pretty much true statements, but they have
little point, unless you were trying to teach me manners. If so, as list
adminstrator I should advice you that that is inappropriate for
discussion on this list.

Note to John, please interpret last email as theory on process usage for
the purposes of discussion. Your input in the discussion has been
excellent, so I hope I did not discourage you in any way.

&gt;<i> Many processes on a laptop, desktop and server system sounds like the right
</I>&gt;<i> thing to do. It doesn't make sense to me to develop a multiple-process
</I>&gt;<i> operating system and then encourage people not to use its multiple-process
</I>&gt;<i> features.
</I>
You misunderstood. I am not encouraging people not to use its
multiple-process features. I am merely theorising that while 'ls' was a
process in UNIX, it probably makes more sense for it not to be in an
object-oriented operating system. That doesn't mean I don't think we
should use processes for applications or servers. If I may quote myself:

&gt;<i> There is certainly no need to use processes in the same way UNIX forced
</I>&gt;<i> programmers to, but we can nevertheless support the basic process model
</I>&gt;<i> since it is the foundation for many different uses. You can look at a
</I>&gt;<i> process as a perimeter around executing code that should not be able to
</I>&gt;<i> interfere with, or be interfered by, anything else. Objects that work
</I>&gt;<i> together to achieve a goal can go in the same process*.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (*) Usually. The exceptions should be obvious to the developer.
</I>
That is, I think applications and servers should generally be processes
because they generally meet the above criteria for having a process
(another reason for having a process might be to run standard programs
that read from stdin and write to stdout). So, I do like processes.

Does this make sense now?
