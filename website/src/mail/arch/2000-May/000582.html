Treating bytecode as a C/C++ resource puts the raw data from a .class file
into the DATA segment. It stores bytecode in the same file with a virtual
machine.

I am working toward a primordial class loader that enables a virtual
machine and its vm-specific classes to be statically linked into a single
executable image. A single executable image is easier to boot and easier to
make ROM-able.

A primordial class loader must load vm-specific classes. It is one of the
implementation details outlined in the Java Virtual Machine Specification.
Each virtual machine must implement some kind of primordial class loader.

IBM's JDK 1.1.6 on OS/400 is a good example of how it should work. This
virtual machine always knows how to load its vm-specific classes. It never
puts the standard class library on CLASSPATH. It simplifies the launch of a
Java application. Compared to other virtual machines, it is more difficult
to get CLASSPATH wrong. Its primordial class loader won't allow you to load
the wrong vm-specific classes. It is neither necessary nor desirable to
store a virtual machine and its vm-specific classes in separate files. It
is certainly not desireable to load vm-specific classes through CLASSPATH.

In addition, an executable image is always read-only. There is a critical
advantage in letting a virtual memory manager know what is read-only versus
read-write. Bytecode is read-only, too. Using bytecode as a resource in the
DATA segment reduces the footprint of a virtual machine at runtime.

If that were not enough, it is possible to reduce the size of a virtual
machine further. This enables a file subsystem to be written in bytecode
and then used to load the rest of the standard class library -- as needed
-- from a local storage device. Elsewhere, the rest of the standard class
library can be downloaded -- as needed -- across a network.
