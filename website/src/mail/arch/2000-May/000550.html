<PRE>&gt;<i> Wait! I thought a class definition has no static fields. If it has no
</I>&gt;<i> static fields, it has no link to any superclass. A class definition only
</I>&gt;<i> knows the name of its superclass, not the class definition of its superclass.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise, both a class definition and a class would be the same thing.
</I>
	No.  The link to a superclass is not a static field; it's an index
into the constant pool, defined in the class file specification*. The
security/type violation occurs as follows.  I compile two classes, A and
B.  A and B are the same, and use reflection to access their fields,
except that A subclasses C, and B subclasses D.  Clearly, classes A and B
are not the same -- suppose C were Thread and D were ClassLoader.  Classes
A and B could be /identical/, save for the 'extends' clause; failed
reflections could be caught and ignored.  Now I load A and B into the VM
and want to share their class definitions.  Obviously, there's a
problem.  If A 'wins' the share, B becomes a Thread subclass, instead of a
ClassLoader subclass.  And vice-versa.

	However, we don't need to worry about this.  Parent classes, as
I've noted, are explicitly embedded in the classfile.  Therefore, only
classes whose parents share a symbolic name will have identical
classfiles.  The question to ask, then, is: what happens when process one
loads A and C, C is recompiled, and process two loads B and C'?  If B
still works with C' (suppose you only changed a method body), A will work
with it also.  However, is allowing A and B to cast to each other (or to
C, actually) still OK?  If I try share an object whose parent class in my
process is out of date,	should it go through?  I would think, for ease of
upgrading, the answer should be yes -- but if we use recursion to attempt
an 'illegal' cast between the parent classes, the answer would be no.  Any
thoughts?

* That is, the set of things immutable under the setstatic() bytecode
includes the parent of the class.
