<PRE>&gt;<i>Requiring superclasses to share class definitions for illegal casts to
</I>&gt;<i>work is clearly the most correct way to handle it. But as _Quinn pointed
</I>&gt;<i>out, things might work out by themselves anyway. If they do, we can save
</I>&gt;<i>ourselves from having to do a more expensive check to allow illegal
</I>&gt;<i>casts.
</I>
Here's my thoughts on the subject so far, muddy as hell as always.

1. For &quot;class definition&quot;/&quot;bytecode&quot; sharing for memory compression, it is
my personal belief that only a &quot;rough combination of the two&quot; should be
allowed to be shared.  Let me elaborate.  The JVM should of course take the
bytecode and transform it into its internal optimized version.  Usually (as
it seems), this also includes defining the superclass / interface pointers
as well.  IMHO, only the &quot;internal optimized version&quot; should be shared,
while the pointers to superclass / interfaces need to be tacked to the
static data associated with the class instance.  For performance purposes,
we could have a low-priority thread in memory which does bytecode/internal
version checking for each newly added class.  This means that two instances
of the same class file can be at different memory positions.

2. If we only allow illegal casts with classes loaded by the primordial
class loader, then all we need to check is if the two class instances
indeed were loaded by that class loader, and have the same name, since
class loaders should only allow one class instance per class name.  This
also implies that the class' superclasses should be identical as well.

Or is that what everyone's already been saying?


&quot;If it works, it's not advanced enough.&quot;
