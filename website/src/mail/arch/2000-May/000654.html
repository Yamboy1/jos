You have to understand that there are different ways of looking at it.
For example, you /could/ consider a program defined using the main
method (Sun's API for Java Applications) generically as a subprogram,
but I don't. You seem to be requiring that I see things the way you do,
but there are other ways of looking at it.

I will explain why I don't see a Java application as a subprogram, but I
do not require that you see things my way. In fact, Sun explains it best
themselves:

<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/getStarted/application/anatomy.html">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/getStarted/application/anatomy.html</A>

&quot;Remember that a Java application is a standalone Java program-- a
program written in the Java language that runs independently of any
browser. &quot;

&quot;standalone&quot; implies a lot of things, including that it is not a &quot;sub&quot;
program, but also that if application developers assume that
applications are standalone (which should be safe to assume since Sun
tells you this is so) then applications may not work at all as sub
programs.

Now, you could say that some programs that use this API are subprograms,
and some are Java applications, but do you think it is right to use the
same API for two different types of programs*? That would be the
opposite of strongly typed. Personally, I don't think this API is a
subprogram API (which explains why I do not think subprogram APIs are
necessary to invoke an Application in a process)

{ * If you want to use it as a subprogram API for specific programs that
are subprograms, please do. But since Sun says that this is the API you
use for writing applications, it is incorrect to say a subprogram API is
needed to run a process. }

&gt;<i> Any
</I>&gt;<i> subprogram API will do. A subprogram API is not optional. It is more than
</I>&gt;<i> useful; it is required.
</I>
Again, it is only required for your way of looking at it. To say it is
required, period, is to force your views upon others. And this is
especially unfortunate when you claim someone else's project as a
dead-end project (ie. that rheise.os can never become a &quot;genuine&quot;
bytecode process) simply because it does not meet &quot;your&quot; requirements.

&gt;<i> The
</I>&gt;<i> Java Native Interface does not require a C/C++ program to look for main(),
</I>&gt;<i> nor exclusively use a primordial class loader, nor to invoke a static main().
</I>
I did not consider it important that I support the calling of any
method, not just main, because Sun tells us that the standard way to do
it is the &quot;main&quot; method.

However, if you would like me to support different method names, that is
doable. But please make it as a suggestion rather than handling it the
way you did.

&gt;<i> On the one hand, fix-up code creates four threads, sets up
</I>&gt;<i> System.properties (etc), requires a static main() and passes additional
</I>&gt;<i> parameters through args. And, a Java application must implement a method
</I>&gt;<i> called &quot;main&quot;. Main must have a method access of public and static. Main
</I>&gt;<i> must have a method descriptor equal to &quot;(L[java.lang.String;)V&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is one way of doing it. It is not the only way.
</I>
I can allow the name of the method to be invoked to be passed in, but
maybe you can give useful examples of this before I implement it. I am
trying to keep the API simple, this being something that can always be
added at a later stage, I'd like to know if it is worth adding it first
before I add it.

As for the other subprogram APIs (what I consider the &quot;genuine&quot;
subprogram APIs, but you are not required to see things this way) I
discussed on this list quite a while ago my desire to be able to run
servlets (which are sub programs) in an environment that gives you much
of the benefits of processes:

	<A HREF="http://jos.org/pipermail/arch/2000-May/000554.html">http://jos.org/pipermail/arch/2000-May/000554.html</A>

This was before you started complaining that my process API did not take
subprograms into account. The fact is I had started considering it even
before you brought it up. Sure, I haven't worked out the perfect way to
do it yet, but do you claim you have?

My thoughts so far have been along different lines from yours, but
that's allowed, no? The differences include:

1. I do not attempt to handle different program APIs generically, but
let user code (which knows how to deal with the specific API) deal with
it.

2. My reason for supporting subprograms in rheise.os is to give them
some of the advantages processes provide (separate namespaces, and
security).

For (1), I achieve this by casting the specific subprogram interface to
a java.lang.Object and storing that in the container (whether it is a
JavaProcess or something else I haven't yet decided). The container will
have its own class loader (to provide separate namespaces) and UserToken
(to provide security). I won't go into the details of how the first
object is constructed, but it is made available to the client code which
knows what methods to call on it to make it do its stuff.

For (2), I believe that running subprograms without giving them a
process-like environment is something that can be achieved outside the
framework.

&gt;<i> &gt;Then I don't understand your criticism of rheise.os:
</I>&gt;<i> This thread is not about rheise.os.
</I>
It is related.
