<PRE>public class SharedObject extends/* | implements */ SharedObjectAPI {
	public void doSomethingUseful() { /* like calculate pi */ }
	}

public class jpOne extends JavaProcess {
	public SharedObject so = null;

	public void run() {
		SharedObject so = new SharedObject();
		jpTwo jp = new jpTwo();
		jp.put( so );
		so.wait();
		so.notify();
		this.kill();
		} /* should die at the end of run, anyway */
	} /* end jpOne */

public class jpTwo extends JavaProcess {
	public SharedObject so = null;

	public void put( SharedObject so ) {
		this.so = so;
		so.notify();
		so.wait();
		so.doSomethingUseful();
		}
	} /* end jpTwo */

	Admittedly, this is the pathological case, but that just makes it
easier to consider.  jpOne generates a shared object, and as the parent of
the jpTwo process, has implicit permission to share so with it.  It then
waits for jpTwo to say that it has so, tells it move along, and kills
itself.  jpTwo notifies jpOne that it has the object, and then waits for
confirmation, after which if doesSomethingUseful() with so, the shared
object.  However, odds are good the so's process has been killed / died
/ lost in the woods.

	What do we want to happen right now?  Can we fail
so.doSomethingUseful() with a null pointer exception?  Is that semantically
legal?  (Probably not.)  Is it allowed by the VM or language
specs?  (Probably not.)  For simplicity's sake, a SharedObject doesn't
even have any fields; it's just used as a semaphore.  (Shared references
confuse the issue; I'm hoping we can deal with them recursively.)

	At a bare minimum, it's clear that anything aside from nulling
requires the class definition* of SharedObject -- wherever it may be
'located' -- to remain legal.  This is assured by normal garbage
collection; the so object in jpTwo requires a Class pointer, which in turn
contains a pointer to its definition.  (The static values in the class are
lost; I believe that the expectation is that a SharedObject would access
the statics of whichever process happened to be using it at the time,
information that would be procured from the scheduler.)  Any class
definition contains a reference to a super class.  Bytecode references are
purely symbolic; native references are pointers.  For native references,
this means that the super class will always be shared.  (Since we, by
definition, have a single copy of that pointer.  It is probably desirous
to force the sharing of class definitions to be recursive for this matter;
that is, all class references located in a class definition will either
match, or a share attempted; if any of them fail, the whole share fails.  
Otherwise, you hit type-safety snags.)  The picture for bytecode
references is similar; if we're maintaing bytecode payloads, we must have
the parent class's bytecode somewhere, and the two payloads can be checked
for equality.

	So the minimum is satisfied by the recursion necessary to succeed
in the share.  (This needs to be added to the summary.)  In fact, so long
as the originating/single-owner process remains live, the minimum is
sufficient for proper sharing; all references are still live.

	Back to the case at hand -- a hard reference to an object whose
'owner' pointer will prevent a threadless/killed/dead process from being
garbage collected.  I expect we agree that is Not Good.  Since the shared
object has already met the minimum requirements -- that is, without
references, it can't tell if it's operating in its originating process or
not -- it is transparent to re-write the classloader pointer to point to
jpTwo.**  So far, so good.  Referenceless shared objects work OK, because
we can transparently rewrite the classloader reference of the shared
object to avoid GC problems.***

	All static references are stored with the class in the process's
classloader, and exist on a per-process basis.  We have never considered
sharing classes themselves.  So static references in shared objects will
work just fine -- because we can rewrite the classloader reference of the
shared object to avoid GC problems.

	The problem is instance references.  Every instance reference
which escapes must be a shared object, for the same reasons we can't just
hand unchecked references around between processes.  I think to here is as
far as we've discussed; at least, it's as far as I have a good idea of
what's going on.  I believe, also, that the semantics of this care are
fairly clear; every escaping variable must be handled in the same as an
explicit request to share an object -- whatever that might be.

	If things follow the trend, we should come to a conclusion that
instance references in shared objects are OK, because we can
recursively rewrite the classloader references in all of them.

	All of this is in the case that the object's classloader reference
becomes invalid, and I think that is a key way of phrasing things.  A
process and (primordial, but that's what been under discussion)
classloader define each other; killing a process means invalidating its
classloader.  (Though not, necessarily, everything in it, because of
shared objects.)  It looks like three elements will suffice for general
object sharing:

(1) Shared class definitions.  This includes parent class definitions,
whensoever this might be checked.  (At share or access time.)  This is
provided and run by the kernel/VM.

(2) The ability to rewrite an object's classloader reference.  This is
provided by the kernel/VM to Java.  In the above examples, there was no
distinction made between rewriting an object's classloader reference, and
the CL references of the class it pointed to; since the classloader of the
class was already invalid, no harm is done by blind-writing to it.  (The
shared class under consideration will not be GC'd because jpTwo's
classloader has a pointer to it.)  In the general case, where both
processes are still active, it may be necessary to have a per-object CL
reference.  This needs more discussion.)

(3) The ability to determine when a classloader reference is invalid, and
then the ability to use (2) to correct it.

* Here, I'm not concerned with the mechanics of definitions.  It seems
clear to me that we will eventually hammer out the differences between
native and bytecode representations so as to be able to use both to our
mutual advantage, if we haven't already.

** I won't go into the exact mechanism here, though clearly one that adds
no additional references is necessary.  A list must be attatched to the
shared object and maintained; I leave the question of how open to 'the
floor'. :)

*** Necessarily, the VM /must/ always ask for its current process rather
than following its classloader pointer when fetching classes on the shared
object's behalf.  Doing this for /every/ object, shared or not, will be
too expensive; some optimization will be necessary.  (An O(1) test if
there is more than one 'potential owner' -- e.g. accessor?)
