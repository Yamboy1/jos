<PRE>&gt;<i> I have searched and searched; but, I cannot find anything that prevents us
</I>&gt;<i> from sharing class definitions for all class loaders, both primordial and
</I>&gt;<i> custom. Where does this requirement come from?
</I>
	We're misunderstanding each other.  My current understanding --
and Ryan's, apparently -- is that we can share bytecode as prolificly
(sp?) as we like.  The condition I had been getting hung up was from your
implication that we could ignore the classloader in which it
originated.  This is big no-no w.r.t. to the VM spec, which I'm sure
you're aware of.  Our solution is to allow casts to ignore the ClassLoader
equality requirement if and only if both classes were loaded by the
primordial classloader.  Our understanding is that this will not violate
transparency; if a class is loaded into the process's primordial class
loader in, it will behave exactly as if it were loaded the /only/
primordial classloader in a single-process VM.  Allowing a cast from a
different process will not break the VM model -- since it does not have a
process model!  (Previously, we had thought only primordial classloaders
could share classes because we had incorrectly conflated sharing with
casting.)
