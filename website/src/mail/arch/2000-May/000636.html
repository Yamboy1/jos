My feeling is that class archives will not be changed on disk very often
and so most of the time class definitions will always match and inlining
will not need to be done more than once in each case.

The question is, when it does happen, will the model (whatever that is)
be efficient or not?

&gt;<i>  (That is, how

</I>
It depends on whether the model/solution we choose affects performance
even if you are not executing a cross process inlined method.

&gt;<i> Second, having symbolic references mismatch

</I>
Statics aren't the only things involved here. If you call
sharedObject.someMethod() and that method tries to interact with other
classes, it should interact with the classes in its own process, and not
the currently executing process (for the same reasons I stated for
statics).

&gt;<i>  One question I do have, though, looking at
</I>&gt;<i> this from a UNIXy point of view.  I share two things -- a memory location
</I>&gt;<i> (my static variable) and a function pointer (the method in question).  The
</I>&gt;<i> function referenced by the pointer reads and writes from that global
</I>&gt;<i> variable.  At no time should two simultaneous executions of the function
</I>&gt;<i> find different things in that global variable -- it being shared, they're
</I>&gt;<i> reading/writing to the same place.
</I>
Why must the static variable be shared (considering that I have
explained in detail why I think it should not be)? Am I missing
something in your explanation? (forgive me, it's 1:30am here :-)

&gt;<i> If this proves to be unworkable, we may be
</I>&gt;<i> forced to restrict shared objects to those whose classes (and parents) do
</I>&gt;<i> not have statics.
</I>
An interesting idea, but consider that that shared object is an
interface to what's going on in another process. If you call a method on
it, it might do some talking with some objects or classes in its own
process. When it talks, to those classes, it should be talking to the
classes it thinks it's talking to (same argument for statics). This is
important if only the shared object requires shared class definitions
but the classes it depends on do not require shared class definitions.
The shared object really does belong to that other process (it was
created by that process) so whenever it is executing, it should behave
as though it is linked with that process.

(although I'm not giving this as much thought as I usually do. A few
more emails and I'll be off to sleep)
