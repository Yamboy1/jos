Understood.

</I>
At this point we disagree. I believe that:

- static values won't be lost until the class they are associated with
  is garbage collected.
- the expectation is that a SharedObject would internally access the
  statics associated with the object's class.

I think we need to do it right so it works in complex cases. In the
windowing system, shared objects may be as complex as swing components.
Those objects may work with the rest of the swing system via statics, so
it is important that the shared objects which communicate with the rest
of the window manager (via statics) actually communicate with the rest
of the window manager - not with the uninitialised statics in the
calling process.

</I>
Great, so this does solve the problem of incompatible superclasses (ie.
to share class definitions, we must share the superclass' class
definitions).

&gt;<i> Otherwise, you hit type-safety snags.)  The picture for bytecode
</I>&gt;<i> references is similar; if we're maintaing bytecode payloads, we must have
</I>&gt;<i> the parent class's bytecode somewhere, and the two payloads can be checked
</I>&gt;<i> for equality.
</I>
I think the bytecode cache can ignore the superclasses - it saves
memory. It is when class definitions are formed or reused from the cache
that the superclass constraint must apply. The two caches are separate
so they can have different rules depending on their requirements.

&gt;<i> 	Back to the case at hand -- a hard reference to an object whose
</I>&gt;<i> 'owner' pointer will prevent a threadless/killed/dead process from being
</I>&gt;<i> garbage collected.  I expect we agree that is Not Good.  Since the shared
</I>&gt;<i> object has already met the minimum requirements -- that is, without
</I>&gt;<i> references, it can't tell if it's operating in its originating process or
</I>&gt;<i> not -- it is transparent to re-write the classloader pointer to point to
</I>&gt;<i> jpTwo.**  So far, so good.  Referenceless shared objects work OK, because
</I>&gt;<i> we can transparently rewrite the classloader reference of the shared
</I>&gt;<i> object to avoid GC problems.***
</I>
As I've said, we disagree here. I think an object needs to know which
process it's running in. I don't see why it is a &quot;minimum requirement&quot;
that an object not know what process it's running in. This is not
necessary to rewrite the class loader reference, and if we do it, I
believe the system won't work correctly.

&gt;<i> 	The problem is instance references.  Every instance reference
</I>&gt;<i> which escapes must be a shared object,
</I>
Or as I see it, every instance reference which escapes is, by
definition, a shared object. Is that the way you see it?

&gt;<i> 	All of this is in the case that the object's classloader reference
</I>&gt;<i> becomes invalid, and I think that is a key way of phrasing things.  A
</I>&gt;<i> process and (primordial, but that's what been under discussion)
</I>&gt;<i> classloader define each other; killing a process means invalidating its
</I>&gt;<i> classloader.  (Though not, necessarily, everything in it, because of
</I>&gt;<i> shared objects.)
</I>
Note that if we have thread-less processes (as I discussed in a previous
email), the class loader should not be invalidated. We have two options:

1. Invalidate the class loader only for &quot;normal&quot; processes once they
die (your suggestion), ie. when they have no more threads running.
Thread-less processes, however, would not have their class loaders
invalidated in this case.

2. Handle it generically: never invalidate the class loader. Allow it to
operate until it is garbage collected.

At this point I don't know which way is best but I thought I'd point out
that (1) is not the only way.

If your goal is to make something &quot;very bad&quot; happen when the owner of a
shared object dies, then (1) can achieve part of that goal, but it won't
have any affect unless the shared object tries to load a new class.
Maybe the answer is to invalidate the process rather than invalidate the
class loader. Invalidating the class loader prevents you from loading
classes, but invalidating the process (however that is implemented)
stops anything in that process from working. I have no idea how to
implement this though, and maybe we can just forget about it and go with
(2) alone.
