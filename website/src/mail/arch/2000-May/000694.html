&gt;<i>From a language perspective, direct sharing makes things easier for the

proxies because it is more useful. It should at least be worth
considering the same level of usefulness in shared objects). A &quot;direct&quot;
approach is also more efficient (suppose you wanted to share an instance
of java.awt.Graphics?)

&gt;<i> because it can't be done predictably, reliably or safely.
</I>
Direct sharing involves:

- extending the type system
- distributed memory management

We have almost completely specified the first so that it behaves
predictably, reliably and safely.

I have been working on completely specifying the second to behave just
as predictably, reliably and safely. If this &quot;cannot&quot; be done, I may as
well give up. Is this what you are suggesting?

&gt;<i> Nobody really wants rogue objects to cross the persistence barrier.
</I>
If you want to break the &quot;persistence barrier&quot; it helps to think of it
in different ways. As long as you think of it as a &quot;persistence barrier&quot;
it is going to remain a barrier.

&gt;<i> After you work out all of the &quot;complexities&quot; of direct sharing, you'll find
</I>&gt;<i> that (a) you'll have to introduce some form of proxy to get past the
</I>&gt;<i> persistence barrier, and (2) at first, you won't recognize it as a proxy at
</I>&gt;<i> all (so that you can continue to claim direct sharing).
</I>
I'm not convinced.
