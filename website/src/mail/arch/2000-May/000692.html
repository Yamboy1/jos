This is part of a broader observation that classes should not be shared.
I have spent most of the weekend trying to justify this conceptually
because as it stands, what I am proposing seems to undermine Java's type
system. I think that is part of what Gilbert was trying to get across
(although I didn't quite understand the rest).

Firstly, why shouldn't classes be shared? One would think that the most
straightforward approach to direct object sharing is to share the
object's Class between the participating processes (or even just
programs) so that type equivalence is done without undermining the type
system. This can be done by having shared classes loaded by a common
class loader. This is the UNIX shared memory model _Quinn was mentioning
earlier (both the object and class (ie. statics) are shared in memory in
a 'single' location).

To see how such a solution might work, let's look at an old design I
posted a while ago:

=====
I could imagine a server process that corresponds to an ORB (Object
Request Broker), and a findSharedClass(domain, class) method that defers
loading to the ORB's class loader for the specified domain*. Once
loaded, the class still cannot be redefined in that class loader, but
you can then call orb.reload(domain) which will cause the ORB to replace
its class loader for your particular domain.

{*} domains would correspond to the individual uses of IpC. For example,
you could define a domain for doing IPC between the window manager and
processes that wish to draw to a window.
=====

The general design here is fine (although I'd improve orb.reload() now).
The concept of domains allows for two separate IPC channels to coexist
using different versions of the same classes since each domain has its
own class loader. But what is wrong with this particular implementation?
(that is, assuming you understand the benefits of direct object
sharing?)

It turns out that sharing classes to ensure proper type equivalence when
sharing objects does not work in practice (or at least that seems to be
the case). A single process is unable to do IPC with two server
processes where both server processes are of the same type, but are
being used for different purposes. In this case, each server process
will set up a different domain with the ORB, and therefore each server
process will load its own class for the shared object. When my
application wants to do IPC with both of those server processes, it is
only able to load a single class to reference both shared objects. It
needs two, but it can only use a certain class name once. Using Java's
type system, we are unable to achieve direct object sharing with the two
servers this way.

By allowing two classes that share the same class definition to be
treated as the same for shared objects, we get around this problem (the
exact semantics of this have already been discussed). What we are aiming
for is a way to keep processes separate with their own classes (as in
CORBA) but to provide an efficient interface to server objects in a
server process. Because of Java's type system, the Class the client uses
to interface with the server object should not be the same as the Class
in the server (as demonstrated in the above example). However, we want
to treat both classes as the same *type*.

And here we come to the point of this email. My original goal was to
justify our bodgy type equivalence based on class definitions. I am
proposing that we extend Java's type system as follows: two classes may
(*) be of the same type (**) if they both share the same class
definition. The same type may be used in different processes but the
same class may not. An object may be cast between two classes of the
same type.

(*) The exact semantics are left to discussion. Hint: what type do you
assign to classes loaded by custom class loaders?
(**) The word &quot;type&quot; is open to debate. Upon first glance of the
relevant section of the vm spec (chapter 5), my use of the term seems to
fit in without any confusion. If you find there is some confusion, it is
entirely possible to select a different word.
