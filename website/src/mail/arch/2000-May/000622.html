Because I would be least surprised the other way.

My claim is that when an object attempts to access its statics, it
expects to access the statics through object-&gt;class-&gt;statics.

Since an object only has one -&gt;class, it also strikes me as the easiest
way to implement it. I think you agreed to that once:

	<A HREF="http://jos.org/pipermail/arch/2000-April/000500.html">http://jos.org/pipermail/arch/2000-April/000500.html</A>

In the general case, I am proposing:

&quot;Static references are resolved via the class loader of the caller.&quot;

That actually sounds very close to something I read in the spec, so it
should create the least surprise. It seems to extend very well to the
shared object case, too.

If we exclude the possibility of shared objects, resolving statics via
the class loader of the caller makes complete sense in that it is how
the spec defines the expected behaviour. When we introduce shared
objects, the only difference is that an object may be seen through two
different classes with the same name (different classes but the same
class definition). Let's look at an example:

class SharedObject
	{
	static int stat;
	}

Process A creates one of these objects through its own class loader. It
now has the SharedObject class loaded, and an instance of that class.

Process B obtains a reference to this object by casting it to its own
version of the SharedObject class. The dynamic type of the object is
still the class loaded in Process A (this is determined by the hard link
object-&gt;class).

We both agree that if Process B accesses SharedObject.stat, it will
resolve to its own version of the SharedObject class and therefore
access the statics of its own process. And of course, if Process A
accesses SharedObject.stat, it will also resolve /its/ own version of
the SharedObject class and therefore its own statics. That is a given
because that is what the spec says.

But if the shared object itself tries to access its own statics, how do
you define &quot;its own statics&quot;? My guess is that an object will only
behave correctly if it is what it thinks it is. What an object is, is
made up of the instance, and the class that defined it. When a routine
in the object is purely non-static, it will always behave correctly. But
if the routine involves statics, the routine will have half worked and
half not, assuming that Process B is calling the routine on the shared
object of Process A. It will *think* it has updated the necessary
statics and put itself into a consistent state, but when things return
to normal and process A tries to do stuff with the object, it will find
that it is not in a consistent state (process B has interfered). Process
A will find that the object has changed state without the statics also
changing state, while the programmer could have sworn that it was
programmed to always keep the static and instance variables consistent
with eachother.

In short, an object would be very surprised indeed if when trying to
access its own statics, it actually accessed the statics of a completely
different class to which it has no association.
