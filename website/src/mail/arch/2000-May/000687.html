<PRE>[This will take a while.]

Processes/

	Processes exist to protect concurrent sequences of operations
('executing programs') from each other, the most significant process(es)
of all being the operating system.  The primary model/method of
concurrency in Java is threading.  When properly initiated, threads may
not interfere with each other except via static methods or variables.

	Threads &amp; Interference/
	
	Consider your generic Runnable Object as a node in a dataflow
	graph.  We will examine only instance methods and
	variables.  Looking at Runnable, we see the void method
	run().  Nothing can escape there.  Looking at Object, the only
	possible problem is getClass(), which returns an object generated
	by the VM.  (The java.lang.Class instance of the class of the
	Runnable Object we're examining.)  Since we're ignoring statics,
	we can assume that whatever changes may be made to the Class
	do not escape.  (That there are no other references to this
	particular Class instance.)  Clearly, this Runnable Object and
	it branch in the graph can not interfere with a Runnable Object
	elsewhere in the graph.  If it generates a Runnable Object,
	it could, but that's the programmer's problem, not ours.  (Unless
	that Runnable Object is designated as a process, which we'll
	address later.)

	To continue: it is necessary and sufficient that for statics to be
ignored to protect from threads from themselves.  Furthermore, it is
necessary and sufficient for statics to be ignored to meet the definition
of 'process.'  (This is the basis of of our discussion about processes so
far.)  That is, aside from statics, example A is sufficient for the
concurrency and protection required in an operating system.

	Example A/
	
	public class RunMain implements Runnable extends Object {
		Class c;
	
		public void run() {
			/* execute main() method from class c,
			   generating the arguments locally. */
			} /* end run() */
		} /* end class RunMain */

	public class OS {
		public static void main( String[] argv ) {
			while( true ) {
				RunMain rm = new RunMain();
				rm.c = getNextRequest();
				Thread.start( rm );
				}
			} /* end main() */
		} /* end class OS */


Statics/

	Statics, of course, may not be ignored.  The simplest solution is
to modify the OS class to spawn a new classloader for each request; that
way, every thread not started by an application will have its own set of
statics.  This, to my understanding, is the esssence of rheise.os; it can
also be terribly inefficient.  With a variety of methods we've described,
the non-static portions of classes (the class 'definition', in whatever
form) -- that is, the ones which are redundant across processes, which is
equivalent to saying read-only -- can be shared, reducing that redundancy
to the bare minimum.

Shared Objects/

	Sharing objects between threads is a well-defined operation; a
reference is simply copied from one variable to another.  The reference
takes care of sharing the /properties/ of an object; the runtime system is
responsible for sharing the object's /behaviors/ -- performing the lookup
of its class and that class's symbolic reference.  On occasion, the class
of an object will compared to the type of a variable.  (For instance,
assignment to a field, or usage as a method parameter.)  It is in these
cases that the runtime system (JVM) can look up the class of a shared
object and discover that it doesn't match, having been loaded by another
classloader.  An exception is thrown, and we move on.

	However, threads in different processes will always have different
classloaders, leading the JVM to conclude that the classes are different,
even if their bytecode definitions are identical.  Here we come to our
current controversy.

Properties and Behaviors/

	We have already established the ability to share object
properties.  The equivalance of mechanisms for 'common-value' IPC are well
understood, so I will take the position that we are using shared memory to
communicate the properties of an object.  What we are attempting to
establish is something very basic to Java -- the ability to share object
behaviors.  There are three approaches.  The first is to hope that the
other process* has the 'right' behavior, and just send the properties
over.  The Serializable protocol takes this approach.  RMI, to my
understanding, takes the opposite approach and ensures behavior
compatability at compile-time.  Finally, you can ensure behavior by
sending the behavior -- the classfile** -- along with the properties.

	Footnotes/

	*  Which could be separated in space or in time == orthogonal
	   persistence/serialization.

	** Incidentally, since the classfile doesn't store the 'current'
	   value of its static variables, you could take the position
	   that static variables are a (shared) /property/ of an object.  
	   This supports Ryan's position, which I think I agree with now.

	A shared object, then, always references its original static
variables, as they are a (shared) part of its properties.  If we ensure
that the class definitions are identical (as a precondition for sharing),
it doesn't actually matter which set of behaviors (which have been reduced
to be defined as to methods) we use; in fact, if the JVM utilises sharing,
it will only have one (shared) set to use.

	(That is, shared objects depart from the other two types of IPC in
both implementation and in kind, which is what makes it worth discussion.)

	Clearly, if the class definitions are identical, properties will
be maintained, so long as statics (e.g. the classloader) are (is)  
considered a property of the object.  Clearly, if the class definitions
are identical, the behaviors (as we've reduced to and then defined as the
methods) will be identical.  Clearly, the interpreter itself will be
unable to distinguish between a shared object and one solely belonging to
the current process (thread) under these conditions; so it is clearly safe
to share them.  Our sole bending of the specification would be to consider
identical classes to be the same despite classloader differences in the
sole instance where they were loaded in different processes.

However/

	In the previous discussion, I have considered 'the methods' and
'the fields' of a class as a lump unit.  This is not exactly the case,
which has caused some discussion on this list.  In short, the logic above
requires that 'the methods' and 'the fields' include super classes and
interfaces to be recursively identical as well.  In general, this
requirement should not be hard to satisfy; a parent is identical if and
only if all of its parents are also identical, so we won't have to do very
deep searches.  Furthermore, the normal flow of starting a new process
will generate sharing data at all of the leaves of the inheritance graph
as it goes.  (In fact, we should be able to install a further optimization
-- in most cases the loader and the classpath will be the same, which
means we won't even have to check before start sharing.)

Further concerns/

	Each archive-version pair has its own tree of shared / shareable
class definitions, which can freely inline code from each other.  Even
just this amount of inlining will allow us to optimize the vast majority
of code; Java class libraries are or can be distributed as archives, and
likewise for the JOS class libraries, and most applications.  Where you
get hurt it is in separate classfiles (whose directory could be considered
an archive?) doing development work, where you don't expect performance
anyway.

	In general, adaptive and JIT compiling systems can only optimize
on a per-process basis.  Where there might be an opportunity to optimize
in the application/OS interaction may not exist in another
combination.  It may be well worth it to optimize these interactions even
at the cost of maintaining multiple codebases in memory.  (Strictly, since
JIT is compiling, it can operate on a per-program basis; we just happen to
be running the compiler/optimizer much later than is conventional.  This
is why sharing code between processes will work at all.  However, the
dynamic linking can only be optimized as it happens, which means on a
per-process basis.)
