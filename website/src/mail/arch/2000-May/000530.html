At the right time, implementation should be separated from its interface.
Also, it is a good idea to give different package names to different
versions of a framework/API.

An interface is needed to support a wide variety of implementations. A wide
variety of implementations may be required here because there are a wide
variety of virtual machines. The rheise.os framework can be implemented in
both decaf and other virtual machines. The decaf-specific implementation is
unlike other virtual machines.

&gt;<i>I would imagine that if rheise.os.* is renamed to jos.*, we could have

</I>&gt;<i>org.jos.process.host.HostProcessManagerImpl. This implies that

Yes, we have agreed to the opposite for very good reason.

An interface is used by applications. Applications are unconcerned (or
should be) about the implementation. The well-known interface to the
framework/API should be used by other applications, so it must go in
org.jos.*. Your personal implementation of the framework/API is rheise.os,
and should be. There is no good reason to change it, now or ever.

When there is a rheise-specific implementation of org.jos.process.*, it
should go somewhere within the rheise.* or org.jos.rheise.* packages. When
there is a decaf-specific implementation of org.jos.process.*, it should go
somewhere within the decaf.* or org.jos.decaf.* packages.

A factory should link a framework/API to a specific implementation. A
factory and only a factory should always provide an implementation of a
process manager. A process manager should implement the getProcess()
method. The process manager implementation should not contain static
methods. If static methods are provided, they must use the factory and
dispatch requests to the real process manager.
