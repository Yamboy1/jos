<PRE>&gt;<i> The key reference when talking about the GC is the reference from the
</I>&gt;<i> shared object to its owning process (via the ProcessClassLoader).
</I>
	Which is maintained in the kernel.  Therefore, we can program the
garbage collector to ignore it.  (And if we've got a GC that ignores
reference cycles for purposes of determining liveness -- which it can do,
when it runs a GC from the root -- we don't need this, either.)

&gt;<i> A process-with-reference (or more correctly, a process running a program
</I>&gt;<i> with a reference) to a shared object is indirectly causing the process
</I>&gt;<i> that owns that object to hang around in memory needlessly.
</I>
	OK, I understand your point now.  Thanks for bearing with me :)

&gt;<i> Not its entire memory tree. If another process has a reference to one of
</I>&gt;<i> its shared objects, the memory tree of that object will hang around in
</I>&gt;<i> memory.
</I>
	I should have said, its exclusive tree.  Anything shared is now in
someone else's tree as well... which sounds alot like shared 'ownership',
doesn't it? :)

&gt;<i> Yes, weak references are a JDK 1.2 thing.
</I>
	Summary: probably not a good idea, for the programming annoyances
you mentioned above, unless we can't come up with anything better.

&gt;<i> Compare the concept of a hierarchical structure with a particular
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of it. ... you say each child has an
</I>&gt;<i> owning directory, or more commonly in this case, a parent directory.
</I>
	I think I'm slowly recovering from a bad case of keyboard vision
here.  Conceptually, yes, processes contain ('own') everything in them,
and that's where it matters.

&gt;<i> You want to depend on a dead process for functionality? I think that if
</I>&gt;<i> a process was ever alive, its purpose was to live, and any functionality
</I>&gt;<i> you're talking about should be carried on while it is still alive.
</I>
	Exactly.  Therefore, something absolutely terrible should happen
to the shared object if the process it depends on for functionality is
killed.  The handling of such objects is an open question; weak references
are designed to allow something awful to happen (e.g. GC), so they seemed
like a natural answer to me.

&gt;<i> However, and this is an idea I couldn't work out how to implement until
</I>&gt;<i> you gave me the idea, it might be desirable to have processes that have
</I>&gt;<i> no threads.
</I>
	The 'ObjectBroker' process comes to mind.  It may be
cleaner/easier to implement this as a process that has a single thread
whose run() method is &quot;sleep();&quot;, though.

&gt;<i> I was never suggesting we add a reverse lookup. As you just said, the
</I>&gt;<i> kernel already maintains ownership information. All I'm proposing is
</I>&gt;<i> that we provide a function to reassign ownership. Multiple ownership can
</I>&gt;<i> then be emulated without any further kernel support.
</I>
	I understand now.  (I think.  I sure didn't before.)  The proposal
is that the kerne/JVM adds only ownership-reassignment, and the user
library can provide the rest of the sharing API and implementation.  I
like it.
