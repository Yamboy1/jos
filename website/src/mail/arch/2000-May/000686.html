<PRE>&gt;<i> Direct sharing has no advantage at all because it can't be done
</I>&gt;<i> predictably, reliably or safely.
</I>
	It would make discussion much more pleasant if you'd avoid
sweeping pronouncements like this.  Within certain limits, we've already
shown that direct sharing will work predictably and safely.  (I won't
address reliably because I'm not sure what you mean by it.)  Predictably
-- the shared object functions identically to shared memory.  Safely --
our focus from the first has been safety (specifically, type safety).  We
can adopt more stringent standards as necessary, in particular requiring
byte-for-byte equivalance between the class definitions in two different
processes.  If necessary, we can require that there be no statics.  The
safety of the system is ensured by the exact same mechanism that secures
it without sharing, via the object broker.  (That is, if you ask for a
system object, the broker will perform certain security checks; a shared
object generated in some other process and accessed via that broker will
be indistinguishable from a system object generated by the broker itself.)

&gt;<i> The greatest minds in the software industry have been working on it
</I>&gt;<i> for 50+ years.
</I>
	And they came up with Smalltalk and its relatives, which do direct
object sharing without any problems.  Smalltalk, obviously, is much more
flexible than Java.  (So much so that I tend to think of Smalltalk more as
goo-oriented programming than object-oriented -- but that's another
story.)  The other reason to avoid direct object shares in distributed
systems is that shared memory doesn't scale.  However, our target
enviroment is a shared-memory architecture.  (From this POV, the # of
processors is irrelevant; just that N processes share the same physical
memory space.)


	More in the next mail.
