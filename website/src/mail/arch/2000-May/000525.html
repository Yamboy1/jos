There appears to be some confusion in the understanding of Gilbert's
bytecode cache. One of the advantages of Gilbert's idea is that it
_does_ allow class definition sharing with classes loaded by custom
class loaders. This does not mean it goes against the spec, if you
realise that classes and class definitions are not the same thing. We
just need to understand that this changes the rules for object sharing.
Instead of allowing illegal casts between any two classes that share the
same class definition, we only allow illegal casts if the Classes were
also both loaded by primordial class loaders.

To clarify, there are two constraints for illegal casting between two
classes:

1. The two class defintions must be the same
2. The two classes must be loaded by primordial class loaders

In my proposal for class definition sharing, (1) implies (2), therefore
there was no need to separate the two. But if we use Gilbert's bytecode
cache, we must consider both constraints individually.
