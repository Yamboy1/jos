<PRE>&gt;<i> Ah.  Here's the heart of the matter for me.  I wasn't understanding what
</I>&gt;<i> exactly was meant by &quot;class definition&quot;.  I was under the impression that
</I>&gt;<i> this was a kind of intermediate phase in the loading of the Class.  From
</I>&gt;<i> the sound of it, a class definition is bytecode which has been loaded by a
</I>&gt;<i> class loader and passed to the JVM, but has not yet been resolved (via a
</I>&gt;<i> native method).  So then I hear you saying that a class definition is
</I>&gt;<i> bytecode associated with a class loader.
</I>
	Yes, no, and maybe.  Yes, a byte-array in class file format, as
defined in the VM spec, is a 'class definition' in the sense that you pass
one to defineClass().  No, a 'class definition' is not bytecode; it is the
machine-and-vm specific translation of the 'bytecode class definition'
into something more efficient to use internally.  Maybe, in that /I/ try
to always say 'bytecode' when I mean 'an array of bytes in class file
format defining a legal class', and 'class definition' when I mean
'instances of the C++ classes decaf uses internally which are distinct
from the statics associated with a native java.lang.Class'; but I don't
always succeed, and it may not be clear from context.

	Most specifically, when I distinguish between a class definition
and bytecode, I mean, an instance of the decaf C++ class
'JavaClass'.  Because the data in this instance is immutable under
legal Java operations to the class, it may safely be shared accross
multiple Java processes.
