We think alike here. I have experimented with a number of security ideas
with rheise.os, most derived from research I did a year ago. I see two
ways of controlling running code:

1. Privileges based on what code is running. Permissions are associated
with code through a policy file.

2. Privileges based on what thread is running.

(1) is introduced by Sun in JDK 1.2. (2) is provided by rheise.os and
depends on (1). For a description of (2), you might want to check out:

	<A HREF="http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/jos/jos-security.html">http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/jos/jos-security.html</A>

which is my original paper, way out of date now with respect to
rheise.os. The terminology is certainly different, so please make any
comments based on the rheise.os source code. UserDomain is now called
UserThreadGroup, per thread permission sets are now granted through
UserTokens which are associated with a user and a permission set.

Since that paper is out of date, I will try to explain the main concepts
as they exist today.

At the most basic level, a process and all threads within it are
associated with what I call a UserToken. That UserToken gives threads a
set of permissions based on the User for that UserToken. You can request
a UserToken from the system for a particular user and start executing
code on behalf of that user. There are two ways to ask for a UserToken:

UserToken SecuritySystem.assumeUser(User user)
UserToken SecuritySystem.assumeUser(User user, Credentials credentials)

In the first approach, no credentials are given, so the extent of what
you can do as that new user is limited to what the policy file says your
code is able to do as that user without knowing that user's password.

In the second approach, valid credentials mean that the resulting
UserToken will have the full privileges of that User. This is the method
you would use to implement the login program, for example.

When you create a new process, by default the UserToken for that process
is inherited from the parent process. When you create a new Thread
within a process, the UserToken is inherited from the parent
ThreadGroup. In fact, the implementaiton details are such that
UserTokens are only associated with ThreadGroups (only they have the
parent/child concept).

When all threads inherit the UserToken from the main thread group, what
you have is a standard process. When you create a subthread with a new
UserToken, you have a powerful way to implement servers such as mail
transfer agents, ftp servers, and anything else that needs to be able to
write to certain files owned by each user. Sendmail needs to be able to
write to /var/spool/mail/ryan, but it should not be able to write to
/home/ryan/.bashrc. On UNIX, Sendmail must be root so that it can do
everything, even though it should only be able to do a little bit as
each user. Not surprisingly there have been many security holes in
Sendmail over the years that allow people to gain unauthorised access to
the root account!

The goal of the UserToken is that a process can only gain the subset of
permissions of another user it needs to do its job.

(For an explanation of why threads running as different users in the
SAME process is safe, please read the out of date paper)

&gt;<i> &gt;This means it would be useful to invent something to contain a servlet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;It could be a threadless process (contradiction?), or it could be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;something else.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How about something like unix su command that changes the permissions of
</I>&gt;<i> running process to appropriate individual. The permissions could then be
</I>&gt;<i> changed back after that particular servlet had serviced it's client.
</I>
Ideally, different code or threads running as different users could
coexist without having to switch back and forth. With threads it's
actually necessary because two threads run at the same time - su will
require state information per thread. With &quot;different code&quot;, su could
handle that so long as it switched back on exiting, but a more elegant
solution exists which is provided by sun (ProtectionDomains) so we don't
need to think about that aspect. The other issues to do with these
threadless processes(?) remain.

A point about su (well, setuid()), it useful in its own right, and there
is an equivalent of this in rheise.os called setUserToken().

&gt;<i> * JIT either is forced to only optimise code that is inside class but can
</I>&gt;<i> never inline code from other classes. For instance if in class A you use
</I>&gt;<i> String objects. The method calls can never be inlined because another

</I>
This comment is relevant to the implications of sharing class
definitions between processes (correct?)

I think you have stumbled across something very important here. We made
a similar oversight with superclasses where if the superclass
definitions were different, interprocess object sharing would be
invalid. We discovered that when we share class definitions between
processes, we must also ensure that the corresponding super class
definitions are also shared with eachother (thanks Matt Albrecht!).

If we ensure a similar thing for all symbolic references, then we can
ensure that it is safe to inline code from other classes. HOWEVER,
ensuring this for all symbolic references is something I was hoping to
avoid because if just one class definition is different, a whole
interconnection of classes (probably the entire process) will not be
able to share their class definitions (all or nothing) meaning we lose
the advantage of saving memory. Instead I was hoping such
incompatibilities could be detected on the fly rather than ensuring they
are ok at link time.

So, we have two options:

1. Ensure all symblic references share class definitions, or no class
definitions may be shared. This /may/ be ok if it turns out that it is
only rarely the case that the interconnection of classes don't entirely
match another process. In this case, we can live with the small loss in
memory saving opportunity.

2. Check these referenced class definitions on the fly. If we want to
inline code, invent some way to maintain different inlined versions for
each process (more specifically, each (primordial) class loader).
Difficult... That is a generic statement of the problem so there will be
many ways to achieve the desired result. Some focused on performance,
and some focused on memory. In the end (if we pursue this direction) we
may fuse the best ideas developed on both sides.

Are there any other options? If we ignore inlining in the short term,
either way is just as easy to implement, and just as effective. This
means we have plenty of time to work out how to do (2) with inlining. If
we haven't worked anything out by then, (1) will always work.

(_Quinn, how do things look from down in the JVM trenches? You'd
probably have the best idea of how this inlining problem can be solved)

&gt;<i> Thus you only really end up sharing the raw bytecode and constant pool
</I>
This is one solution for option (2) to support inlining. It's advantages
include that it has optimal runtime performance. It's disadvantages
include that it requires much more memory.

Thanks for pointing this out!
