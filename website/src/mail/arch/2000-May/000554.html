</I>
The key reference when talking about the GC is the reference from the
shared object to its owning process (via the ProcessClassLoader).

A process-with-reference (or more correctly, a process running a program
with a reference) to a shared object is indirectly causing the process
that owns that object to hang around in memory needlessly. I'm just
pointing out that although having a reference to an object like this is
nothing out of the norm, it is conceptually ugly in the case where the
process object being referenced (indirectly) is no longer needed. It is
a dead process.

Although, you do talk about this being useful later on. I'll get to
that.

&gt;<i> If a process dies, its entire memory tree is

</I>
Not its entire memory tree. If another process has a reference to one of
its shared objects, the memory tree of that object will hang around in
memory. Note that this includes the process that is supposed to be dead.
Invoking an object in a dead process doesn't strike me as a good idea
conceptually (at least not in this context - read on)

&gt;<i>  If we decide that all shared objects operate with weak

</I>
I consider weak reference as an option because they are not as
convenient to program against. You have to call
(ObjectType)reference.get() before you do anything. If you just called
get() once and always referred to that, that would defeat the purpose of
weak references. But they are useful. We just don't always need to use
them, especially when we can avoid the problem by making sure the owner
of the shared object is always alive as long as other processes wish to
use it. This means re-assigning ownership if the current owner wishes to
die.

Yes, weak references are a JDK 1.2 thing.

&gt;<i> &gt; That's the nature of the system. An object is associated with one class,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which is associated with one defining class loader, which is associated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with one process. Therefore, objects are owned by (/associated with)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; processes and that is reflected in the implementation of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kernel(/JVM). Reassigning ownership of an object to another process is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; therefore a kernel(/JVM) primative, too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Okay, I think I understand where you're coming from here.  I tend
</I>&gt;<i> to think of it as an object HasA process, rather than a process OwnsAn
</I>&gt;<i> object.
</I>
I think the &quot;concept&quot; of multiple Java processes is that the process
&quot;contains&quot; everything running inside of it. So, I would say an object
HasAn owning process (for instance, ProcessManager.getOwningProcess()).

Compare the concept of a hierarchical structure with a particular
implementation of it. You would think that a directory contains a list
of children. However, in the implementation, each child may have a link
to the directory instead (eg. a relational database) or as well as. Do
you say each child has a directory? Rather, you say each child has an
owning directory, or more commonly in this case, a parent directory.

&gt;<i> garbage collector.  If a process sharing an object terminates without
</I>&gt;<i> using the setSomeOtherOwner() (or whatever) function, it may have good a
</I>&gt;<i> reason for doing so -- the shared object may depend on its
</I>&gt;<i> originating/owner process for functionality.
</I>
You want to depend on a dead process for functionality? I think that if
a process was ever alive, its purpose was to live, and any functionality
you're talking about should be carried on while it is still alive.

However, and this is an idea I couldn't work out how to implement until
you gave me the idea, it might be desirable to have processes that have
no threads. ie. they are never technically alive. All they provide is a
separate namespace for code that is actually executed by threads which
belong to other processes. Sort of like how a JavaBean can provide
useful functionality even though it usually doesn't run in its own
thread.

Consider, for example, a servlet engine. Today's servlet engines run all
servlets in the same namespace which makes it difficult for different
users to run servlets on the same server that don't trust each other.
The way a servlet is invoked is not the same as a program. The servlet
engine treats each servlet as an object (like a bean) and calls a method
on it, service(), and passes in a request and response object. It is
also not like a process in that the thread in which the servlet is
executing is not owned by the servlet, but by the servlet engine.
However, ideally it would be nice to treat a servlet as a process in one
way: it should have its own namespace and user privileges. A JavaProcess
provides both of these things through the ProcessClassLoader and the
UserToken. Working out how to actually implement this is tricky, though.

&gt;<i> 	Quick little question session: the kernel (/decaf) already
</I>&gt;<i> maintains 'ownership' (origination) information.  Is the proposal that for
</I>&gt;<i> (only shared?) objects, we should be able to perform a lookup from it to
</I>&gt;<i> the classloaders/processes which could reference it?  (e.g. had, at one
</I>&gt;<i> point, shared it.  This does not necessarily mean it actually /does/
</I>&gt;<i> reference it.)  And that there is some efficiency/elegance gain from
</I>&gt;<i> maintaining such a reverse lookup?
</I>
I was never suggesting we add a reverse lookup. As you just said, the
kernel already maintains ownership information. All I'm proposing is
that we provide a function to reassign ownership. Multiple ownership can
then be emulated without any further kernel support.
