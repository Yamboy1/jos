The bytecode cache idea loses out on three things:

1. it must retain the original payload of the class file
2. it must always read the class data from disk or network when defining
a class.
3. it must always do a byte for byte comparison to ensure class
definition sharing is valid.

But it gains these things:

1. the ability to include custom loaded classes in class definition
sharing.
2. the ability to share class definitions between classes loaded by
primordial class loaders even if the byte-equivalent classes are in
different locations on disk.

It is a trade-off. My class defintion sharing proposal (based on
location and modification date) loses out to your gains, but makes up
for where the bytecode cache falls short. If we just consider these two
proposal, I believe equivalence determination based on location and
modification date is more attractive. But there is a third idea:

A hybrid between the two approaches is possible. It is possible to use
my location and modification date as the first check, which will cover
most of the cases, and use Gilbert's bytecode cache as a fallback if no
equivalent class definition was found in the cache. If Gilbert's code
finds a match, the location and modification date should be recorded so
that subsequent comparisons can use the efficient location/modification
date method.

This idea has the benefits of both approaches, but retains two of the
disadvantages with Gilbert's approach:

- In the case where we must fall back on Gilbert's checking mechanism,
it is slower.
- bytecode payload must be retained.

But again, this is a tradeoff, and a less severe tradeoff considering
that efficiency is gained most of the time through location and
modification date checking. As for retaining the bytecode payload, it
depends whether we are saving more memory than we are using for the
bytecode cache.

I would propose that we implement location/date checking first, and then
integrate Gilbert's bytecode cache at a later stage _if_ we feel we need
to gain more memory efficiency, or if someone wants to implement it
anyway - assuming that the tradeoff is reasonable (this needs to be
verified). This should be transparent to user apps so it shouldn't
matter either way.

One more thought that just occurred to me: maybe we will end up
retaining the bytecode payload anyway. Consider filesystem caching, such
as that which is implemented in Linux. If you read a file once, the
second read will be faster because it is actually cached in memory.
Since the bytecode of a class is exactly the same as what the filesystem
might cache, it might be possible to integrate the two subsystems. This
might be tricky but it's just a thought. If we do this, only one
disadvantage remains for the hybrid approach:

- In the case where we must fall back on Gilbert's checking mechanism,
it is slower.

So, eventually, integrating Gilbert's bytecode cache might be
beneficial. We just need to examine the tradeoff, perhaps by
experimenting with a prototype.
