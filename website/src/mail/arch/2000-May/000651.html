<PRE>Apoligies for the late reply, I have been taking time off and giving
rheise.os long deserved attention.

Fortunately, we are not using up any additional memory at all. Decaf
needs an internal data structure to store the code that it is executing,
and the class definition is that structure (ordinarily this structure
would be called &quot;class&quot; but the class/definition split allows us to do
amazing things).

Naturally :-) Check out my ftp server written in Java:

It is sensible that an ftp server be one process rather than 20. The old
UNIX model forced the programmer to make more processes than intended.
Not only do threads make things easier, but new concepts such as
JavaBeans help too.

&gt;<i> But undex UNIX the kernel allows you to control the resources used by that
</I>&gt;<i> process, to account for how much CPU time it has used etc.
</I>
Right. Sensible process usage (eg. a process per application) would
allow sensible tracking. Whether or not we want finer control is an
interesting question. Of course, accounting per thread is definately
something to consider, but maybe there's not much more we will need.
