Excellent point. Serialization can be used to pass objects from one
bytecode process to another -- especially in MPCL.

&gt;<i>How one gets an instance of a shared object is another story. IMO, the

</I>&gt;<i>random speculation on my part.  Since I am not intimately familiar with
</I>&gt;<i>the kernel and VM, I cannot make a precise judgement.

This is well-known and mature approach to object sharing. Like you said, an
object broker is responsible for managing sharing. I understood a primary
domain (THE system process, known as process 0) would launch a service, a
standard object broker like rmiserver. With this service running, objects
can be shared between bytecode processes and JOS machines.

We've going to have a protocol stack, right? I see no compelling reason to
invent yet another sharing mechanism (YASM). Besides, MPCL was invented to
/prevent/ accidental or automatic sharing of objects.
