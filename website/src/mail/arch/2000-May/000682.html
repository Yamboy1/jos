<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>JOS Wiki has articles about conserving memory, primordial class loaders and
MPCL. The ProcessPages article is a good starting point for more
information on processes.

Personally, I'm comfortable with researching JOS Wiki articles, arch and
kernel mailing lists. I spend a lot of time reading about what other
members think. What is important? What's not? While we might not always see
eye-to-eye, the JOS Project is an important part of software history.
Without our research, a post-Java platform might make mistakes similar to
Java.

Java's primative data types have clearly demonstrated the folly of pure
object-oriented environments like SmallTalk and Eiffel. Java's class file
format, extreme dynamic linking, interfaces and exception handling are
great. Java's virtual machine approach clearly demonstrates that people
want compatibility with &quot;foreign&quot; platforms (hardware, processors and
operating systems).

1. Java's assumption about one primoridial class loader per virtual machine
is costly; it completely missed the potential of MPCL.

2. Java's assumption about one virtual machine per machine code process is
costly; it completely missed the potential of custom class loaders.

3. Java's assumption about programming in place, jars and &quot;acceptable&quot;
incompatibility is costly; it completely missed Java's ability to write
once and run anywhere. People still want to write once and run anywhere.

This mailing list discussion has contributed three additional things:

1. A virtual machine can take far less memory resources than a classic
virtual machine if it caches bytecode, not classes.

2. A primordial class loader is a cornerstone of a bytecode process.

3. A virtual machine can provide more than one primordial class loader. The
Java Virtual Machine Specification must be modified based on the
implications of MPCL.
