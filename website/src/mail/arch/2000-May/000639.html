<PRE>&gt;<i> Exactly. It has proven to be unworkable.
</I>
	Must have missed that proof; could you run it by me again?

&gt;<i> All classes have static fields.
</I>
	The only static fields that are of any import are the Java ones
-- the JVM can manage the others on its own -- and it's trivial to write a
class without static fields.  java.lang.Object, AFAIK, does not have
statics, so subclassing it is not a problem.

&gt;<i> With what we know so far, it might be possible to share objects across
</I>&gt;<i> custom class loaders (with limitations).
</I>
	From what we know, sharing objects across custom class loaders
breaks the specification horribly, which is why Ryan and I required that
any such sharing take place between primordial loaders.  A custom
classloader will /never/ have the same class as any other classloader,
because its classloader property will always be different; using only
primordial loaders allows us the fiction that all primordial loaders are
the same, more or less.  If I create two custom classloaders that don't
use findSystemClass() to fetch a particular class, then that particular
class must have its own statics in each classloader.  Furthermore, objects
of that type can't be shared between the classloaders because their
class's classloader property is different.

	That is, what makes object sharing across processes possible is
that an object's class definition may be safely shared between those
processes, and that is only because the each primordial classloader looks
like the /only/ primordial classloader to each process.  We have been
trying to decide what the proper thing to do with the /class itself/ of
each shared object -- the shell around a class definition containing the
statics.  (As an object is a shell around the class containing its
instance variables.)  Sharing a class in this case does not appear to
break the spec, again because we're dealing with the primordial
loader(s) -- there's no way an application could tell from whence the
class of its object came -- unless we allow it.  Ryan thinks the proper
thing to do is for a shared object to retain its originator's statics; I
have given one contention the other way, and have a second -- transparency
-- which could be negated by the need for a specific sharing API.  (That
is, if we're not being transparent there, perhaps we don't need to be
elsewhere, as well.)

	One way of looking at the question -- 

/* previous use of type SO up here, to
   make sure the class is loaded */
a = getSharedObjectOfTypeSO();
b = new SO();

a.setSOStaticD( 3 );
b.setSOStaticD( 4 );

if ( a.getSOStaticD() == b.getSOStaticD() ) {
	println( &quot;Shared classes.&quot; );
	} else
	println( &quot;Unshared classes.&quot; );
	}
/* end code fragment */

	In a normal virtual machine, which it is our job to emulate, what
happens?  It will return &quot;Shared classes.&quot;, unless gSOOTSO() uses a custom
classloader to redefine SO.  If it does that, I'm not actually sure what
will happen -- if it's something useful, then this is probably the
behaviour we want to go with for true SharedObjects.
