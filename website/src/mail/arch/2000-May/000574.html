<PRE>	Gilbert should discuss what he's been doing w.r.t. continous
source releases and his new packages, because I don't really know much
about them.

	Likewise, Ryan should discuss SwingToolkit and rheise.os -- which
means it ought to have its new name soon, huh?

	I'll talk a little about multiple java processes and the move to
SourceForge here.

	Multi-processing is a necessity for a modern operating
system.  Conventional JVMs and O/S's team up to run multiple java
processes by running multiple JVMs.  This is not particularly
efficient; the class library must be reloaded and stored separately for
each JVM.  While it may be possible to write a JVM such that it could
share class definitions between instances of itself, we have chosen to
implement multiple Java processes in a single JVM.*

	The idea is relatively straightforward, starting with the
observation that processes are processes because they posses their own
address space.  Typically, this is handled in the hardware MMU, which
allows a program to poke at any virtaul memory address and have it
transparently translated to the physical address.  In Java, because there
are no (arbitrary) pointers, it is not necessary to involve the hardware;
a given process can only point at things it already owns.  The two
pictures are as follows: imagine a process as a transparency, with used
memory being dots on it.  Normally, you have a stack of such
transparencies, and the MMU shuffles them around so that the light from
the projector passes through no more than one dot on its way to the screen
-- the mapping of virtual to physical memory.  (Virtual memory/swap space
adds a larger and slower light.)  Multiple Java processes in a single JVM
-- that is, on a single sheet -- are possibly because the JVM can just
tile the sheet with dots, as the processes can't ask for a dot in a random
memory location; since there is only one sheet, we don't have to worry
about contending for the light.  For more on this, please see
<A HREF="http://www.metamech.com/wiki/view/Main/?topic=MultipleJavaProcesses.">http://www.metamech.com/wiki/view/Main/?topic=MultipleJavaProcesses.</A>


* In part because our current kernel does not support native multitasking.


	Our move to SourceForge is part of more general project, still
underway, of reorganizing JOS's presence on the web.  Primarily, we're
SourceForge for its cvs and cvsweb services, both of which were
administrative headaches.  Once it's ready, we'll be adopting the sfWiki
project and using it host our Wiki on SourceForge as well.  (Thanks to the
kind folks at metamech for hosting it for so long!)  sfWiki uses PHP and
MySQL, so we should be able to reactivate several features we had
deactivated (searching among them) because they used too many resources
with our current implementation for metamech to host them.  (IIRC, of
course.)  We'll also be adding some aliases to simplify links to and
within our website, and improve our ability to correct machine problems
that may occur.  We want to roll out cvs.jos.org, lists.jos.org,
ftp.jos.org, and wiki.jos.org sometime soon.
