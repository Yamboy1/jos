That was actually the goal of this release. I was trying to remove all
implementation specific stuff out of the public API package. What's left
in the public API package is only the classes that JOS programs might
interact with (where rheise.os is a proposal for the JOS
process/security/user APIs).

My current implementations of this API are currently included in the
rheise.os package for convenience, but I would like them moved into
somewhere private.

Would you care to take a look in the public API packages of rheise.os
and tell me what you think? See if my separation is actually what you
want?

&gt;<i> Also, it is a good idea to give different package names to different
</I>&gt;<i> versions of a framework/API.
</I>
Agreed. SwingToolkit will remain as rheise.swingtoolkit, while
java.awt.peer will remain as that.

However, the core APIs such as process/user/security APIs need to be in
jos.* or org.jos.*, wherever we decide. For example, take a look in the
rheise.os.process.* package. It contains classes I'd imagine would go on
jos.process.*. This package defines the set of methods used to create
processes, query processes, destroy running processes and so on. So, JOS
programs might have direct references to jos.process.JavaProcess
objects(*), just like current java programs have direct references to
java.lang.Thread objects. If you compare those two classes, you will
find they are similar in style, except rather than passing off
implementation specific stuff to native methods, I pass my stuff off to
the &quot;impl&quot; objects.

(*) Note that JavaProcess is castable to java.lang.Process which is a
nice compatibility feature. This also explains why it is a class, not an
interface (although there are other reasons).

&gt;<i> &gt;I would imagine that if rheise.os.* is renamed to jos.*, we could have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;jos.process.ProcessManager, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;org.jos.process.host.HostProcessManagerImpl. This implies that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;application developers should never use the org.jos package. I realise
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that the JOS project has already agreed on the exact opposite, but this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;seems to make more sense to me so I thought I'd raise the issue again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, we have agreed to the opposite for very good reason.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An interface is used by applications. Applications are unconcerned (or
</I>&gt;<i> should be) about the implementation. The well-known interface to the
</I>&gt;<i> framework/API should be used by other applications, so it must go in
</I>&gt;<i> org.jos.*.
</I>
That's not actually a reason to choose org.jos.* over jos.*. What I
meant was that (from memory) it was decided that jos.* would contain
implementation specific classes, while org.jos would contain public API
stuff. I think the reverse is probably nicer. Rationale:

The public core API of java goes under java.* which is nice and concise.
Sun recommend that any software developer release their software
products under package names that match their reverse dns name. In the
case of JOS, this means org.jos. java.* is the exception to this rule
because it is the core of the Java system.

We are developing an operating system, and our core could exempt from
the same rule. Meaning, rather than having to use the longer package
name &quot;org.jos&quot; we could put our core stuff in jos.*.

This leaves org.jos for additional software that we, the JOS
organisation, write. This could include collaborative software projects
that JOS members work on, but which are not considered part of the core
operating system. This could also include our own implementations of the
JOS process APIs (etc.), although Sun have (conveniently) broken the
rules again with this, and in a way that is difficult for us to mimic.
They have java.* for the core, com.sun.* for software they write to work
with java.*, and sun.* which is a private package for software they
never intend to release the source to (and there's also javax.*). We
want something like sun.* to put our implementations of the public JOS
APIs.

So, they have:

	java.* - core (the Java product)
	sun.*  - private (prefixed with company name)
	com.sun.* - public software (this time following their own package
naming guidlines)

As you can see, we can't generate all three the same way because our
product name is the same as our organisation name. So, I thought maybe
we could just put sun.* type stuff into org.jos.

&gt;<i> Your personal implementation of the framework/API is rheise.os,
</I>&gt;<i> and should be. There is no good reason to change it, now or ever.
</I>
I'm not sure I understand you, because you are telling me what rheise.os
is when I should be telling you what it is. rheise.os a set of core
classes that provide an interface to managing processes, users and
security. This package includes implementations of those core classes,
but while rheise.os remains fixed, different implementations may be
plugged in. The existing implementations are just implementations that
rheise.os includes in its release.

Given what rheise.os *is*, I was initially offended by your claim that
rheise.os, as it is, is just one implementation of some other
hypothetical API, and that there is no good reason to change it, now or
ever. I hope that is not what you mean! :-)

If you mean that the host implementation included with my rheise.os
package should be renamed to rheise.os, and the current rheise.os be
renamed to something else, I'm with you. However, I don't want implied
ownership over rheise.impl.process.host.*, I'd rather it be a
collaborative effort without my name on it - something like
org.jos.impl.process.host.* that the JOS project can distribute to users
wanting to run JOS In a host environment.

&gt;<i> A factory should link a framework/API to a specific implementation. A
</I>&gt;<i> factory and only a factory should always provide an implementation of a
</I>&gt;<i> process manager. A process manager should implement the getProcess()
</I>&gt;<i> method. The process manager implementation should not contain static
</I>&gt;<i> methods. If static methods are provided, they must use the factory and
</I>&gt;<i> dispatch requests to the real process manager.
</I>
If you look at the current design, The public APIs are frontends to
implementations which are generated by factories. In my first version,
the only way I could think of to support factories was to make
ProcessManager an object returned by a factory, meaning it couldn't be
used via static methods (which is inconvenient). In the latest release,
I have solved that problem (still using factories) and I feel the
interface is much nicer.

Rather than calling:

	ProcessManager processMgr = ProcessManager.get();
	JavaProcess process = processMgr.getCurrentProcess()

You call:

	JavaProcess process = ProcessManager.getCurrentProcess();

Sort of like the way Thread.currentThread() is a static method which is
much more convenient than having to first obtain a ThreadManager object.
There is only really one thread manager in the system, just like there
is only one ProcessManager, so the fact that the ProcessManager you're
using is created through a factory should be totally hidden.
