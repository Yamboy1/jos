<PRE>Here is a proposal that might make it easier to discuss classes and their
different types. What is a class? What is a class definition?

Raw bytecode is written by a javac tool and other assemblers/compilers. It
is well-known as an inert collection of octets in a byte array.

BClass - 'B' is for bytecode. This C++ class encapsulates raw bytecode. The
C++ class makes it easy to decode raw bytecode. Instances of BClass can
easily be cached in a bytecode cache and easily shared across class
loaders. This is the type of class that results after loading a class file
into memory. This is the type of class that works with bytecode as a
resource. BClass is stand-alone and cannot be linked to any other BClass.

DClass - 'D' is for definition. This C++ class further refines a BClass.
DClass uses a BClass. Unlike BClass, DClass converts a codepool into
internal structures. If necessary, a constant integer is converted to its
platform-specific form. DClass is stand-alone and cannot be linked to any
other DClass. Without links, a DClass can only be partially compiled into
machine code. Compiled code would depend upon class loader lookup functions
to find other classes.

LClass - 'L' is for Link. This C++ class further refines a DClass. LClass
uses a DClass. Unlike DClass, LClass resolves references to other classes.
An LClass provides Java's &quot;static&quot; fields, since it is fully resolve-able.
It respects the graph of class loaders and uses a lookup function to find
other instances of LClass. With such links, a LClass can be fully compiled
into machine code. Methods of an LClass are actually invoke-able. An LClass
is well-known as the internal, vm-specific form of a class.

JClass - 'J' is for Java. This is a C++ class equivalent to
java.lang.Class. It provides a well-known interface into an LClass. This
class further refines LClass with additional support for the reflection API.

java.lang.Class - This bytecode class is an interface through JClass to an
LClass.

jclass - A jclass is well-known as the exposed, vm-independent form of a C
structure/C++ class found in a native interface, like JNI.

-----

These are class types. Which one is equivalent to a &quot;class definition&quot;?

Understanding a class definition is critical to understanding what can and
cannot be done with a class definition. If a class definition has links to
other class definitions, it interacts with a class loader to look up other
class definitions. In my opinion, a class definition with links (LClass)
cannot be reused by multiple primordial class loaders. A class definition
without links ( DClass) can.

-----

In my opinion, there is great value in caching BClasses because of their
great size and frequent reuse.

In my opinion, BClass and LClass are the most significant. DClass does not
have to be separated out; it can be folded into an LClass. A class
definition without links (DClass) might as well be a base class for a class
definition with links (LClass). The difference between a DClass and LClass
is negligible. Here, I would optimize for size and never actually create a
DClass. Neither LClasses nor JClasses can be shared among multiple class
loaders.
