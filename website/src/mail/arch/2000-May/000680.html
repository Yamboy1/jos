The lengthy studies of CORBA and RMI have come to the same conclusion.
Object sharing /is/ the sharing of object properties, not behavior. The
behavior of an object is up to an implementation. Implementations vary from
one platform to another. A class can be implemented in Basic, C, COBOL,
Pascal, etc..

When an &quot;object&quot; is serialized, its properties are copied. The properties
have no behavior in this state. It's inert. An object's data is prepared in
such a way that it can pass through a persistence barrier.

Through CORBA and RMI, a bytecode process can share &quot;objects&quot; with Basic,
C, COBOL, Pascal and other Java applications -- even on other machines.

Bytecode-based agents are the next step in &quot;object&quot; sharing. When an agent
is serialized, both its properties and class files are copied. The
properties and class files have no behavior in this state. It's inert. With
a virtual machine on both ends of a pipe, an agent can be copied from one
virtual machine to another -- without the class files previously installed
on the target machine.

When serialization is complete, there are two copies of an object. The
original object continues to maintain its state. Serialization is like a
photograph, a snapshot. After an object is serialized, its state (data) can
change.

&gt;<i>How one gets an instance of a shared object is another story. IMO, the
</I>&gt;<i>most elegant way is through an object broker of some kind (whether an ORB
</I>&gt;<i>or subscription of some kind).  That way, the broker could manage the
</I>&gt;<i>sharing and synchronization problems. The broker could exist outside of
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;processes&quot; per se, and could be accessed through JNDI or some other
</I>&gt;<i>interface.  I don't know if these last comments apply, they're just some
</I>&gt;<i>random speculation on my part.  Since I am not intimately familiar with
</I>&gt;<i>the kernel and VM, I cannot make a precise judgement.
</I>
A process starts out with no access to a shared object. There must be some
mechanism, like an object broker, to provide an isolated process with a
reference to a shared object.

When looking at a traditional file subsystem, a real &quot;file&quot; is always owned
by a system process. A real file is never owned by a user process. When a
process &quot;opens&quot; a file, it is given a proxy for the real &quot;file&quot; in the form
of a file handle. Through the handle, the process can read, write and close
the real file.

If 100+ user processes read from the same file, a system process only needs
one copy of the real file in memory. The user process and system process
must interact in consisten and predictable ways.

When looking at a protocol stack, a real &quot;socket&quot; is always owned by a
system process. A real socket is never owned by a user process. Just like a
file, a user process gets a proxy for the real socket, to read, write and
close it.

Likewise, a bytecode process in an MPCL-compatible virtual machine would
use a ProcessDescriptor as a proxy for all processes. The real process is
owned by the system process (or its agent). When a system process runs an
RMI service, the RMI service owns the real &quot;shared&quot; object. All other
processes interact with a shared object through the service mechanism.
Within an MPCL-compatible virtual machine, a proxy for a shared object
might have a unique handle, just like files, sockets and other system objects.

A bytecode process does not need to know when a CORBA/RMI service is
running in the same or different virtual machine. It does not need to know
when a virtual machine is running locally or across the network. It does
not need to know about an implementation's platform. All of the semantics
(rules) of CORBA/RMI are preserve-able and should be preserved. In the need
for speed, a local service is used exactly the same way -- it only runs faster.
