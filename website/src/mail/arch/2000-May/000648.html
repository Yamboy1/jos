<PRE>&gt;<i> A primordial class loader is-a class loader. So if there's a problem
</I>&gt;<i> sharing objects between class loaders in general, there is a problem
</I>&gt;<i> sharing objects between primordial class loaders.
</I>
	This is not true; a PCL can share with another PCL only because
the sharing can be done in a fashion transparent to the JVM
specification, and therefore the running application.  Sharing
between non-primordial classloaders is a problem because the spec does not
allow it.

&gt;<i> This works because t knows ObjectB through the Sharable interface, which is
</I>&gt;<i> a system class. But what if it weren't?
</I>
	Then it wouldn't, and in fact couldn't, work.  There are -- as you
have demonstrated -- programattic ways to share objects.  However, you
wouldn't be able to cast from Shareable to SharedObject, because SO was
/not/ loaded by the PCL (== is a system class).  Reflection, OTOH, may
work, but if you're going to need to use reflection for IPC, serialization
is probably going to be more effective.
