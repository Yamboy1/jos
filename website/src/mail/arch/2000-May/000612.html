<PRE>&gt;<i> That seems to be such a waste. Consider the classic use of processes by a
</I>&gt;<i> UNIX shell. When the shell executes a 'ls' process and then a 'grep'
</I>&gt;<i> process and then a 'wc' process it actually has to start all these 3
</I>&gt;<i> processes.
</I>
	We have two things to discuss here -- first, the issue of class
un/re-loading, second, the proper design for a JOS shell.  The classic
UNIX shell had no choice but to spawn a new process; it could not execute
an arbitrary command in any other way.  This reinforced and was reinforced
by the drive to make process creation extremely cheap on UNIX systems.  
(e.g. copy-on-write, etc)  A JOS shell -- and jsh/jshell/others take this
route -- could either (a) spawn a thread to call some code or (b) execute
the code internally, both of which avoid the costs associated with process
creation.  The only reason to use processes is if you don't trust the code
you're calling; this (ought?) may be true generally, but for many things
-- e.g. ls, cd, the other two-letter names -- a shell writer can provide
or borrow perfectly good implementations from elsewhere.  I'm not saying
the UNIX way is not the Right Way, but we do have more options available.


	The spec we've been working toward makes the implicit assumption
that every PCL starts empty.  For processes to work (well?), however, we
need certain classes that truly a system-global -- that the JVM or
java-based process code inserts into a process before it begins to
execute.  One idea I had quite a while ago, and haven't discussed much
because of its complexity, had to do with the normal (a
normal?  I guess microkernel-esque systems don't really do
this...) parent/child relation between processes.  In many cases, it would
extremely advantageous for the child to inherit many or all of its
parent's class definitions.  For instance -- a shell spawning 'ls'
(probably) already has 'ls' loaded somewhere, along with (almost) all of
the support classes.  Why not allow it the shell to specify that its child
will inherit all its class definitions?  Then the only costs left are the
relatively cheap static initialization and (hoopefully) cheap thread
creation.
