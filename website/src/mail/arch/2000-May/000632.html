<PRE>&gt;<i> (_Quinn, how do things look from down in the JVM trenches? You'd
</I>&gt;<i> probably have the best idea of how this inlining problem can be solved.)
</I>
	Quite honestly, I haven't looked at optimizations at all.  This
particular problem, however strikes me in two ways -- first, how often
will we be trying to inline method calls across processes?  (That is, how
much of a worry is this going to be?  We may just be able to ignore it
without much of a penalty.)  Second, having symbolic references mismatch
across processes will not be a problem if a a shared object does lookups
in the executing process's classloader; the JVM will throw a LinkError
(IIRC) if/when the shared class tries to do something it can't because the
calling process is improperly set up.

	OTOH, you've made good points about where the statics for a shared
object's method ought to be.  One question I do have, though, looking at
this from a UNIXy point of view.  I share two things -- a memory location
(my static variable) and a function pointer (the method in question).  The
function referenced by the pointer reads and writes from that global
variable.  At no time should two simultaneous executions of the function
find different things in that global variable -- it being shared, they're
reading/writing to the same place.  (With the obvious caveats about
synchronity.)  At no time should the two different processes be able to
execute a read on that memory location and get a different value.  (Again,
with the obvious caveats about synchronity.)  This would suggest to me
that we need, in fact, to share the statics of a class (only) when an
object of that type is shared.  If this proves to be unworkable, we may be
forced to restrict shared objects to those whose classes (and parents) do
not have statics.
