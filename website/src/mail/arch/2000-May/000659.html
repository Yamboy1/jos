<PRE>&gt;<i> When talking about the shared object, there is only one memory location
</I>&gt;<i> for that static. However, when talking about the class (which is not
</I>&gt;<i> shared due to complexities discussed in another email to John), the
</I>&gt;<i> static you find is the one that belongs to your process.
</I>
	I'm missing something here.  A shared object's static is in its
class.  If there is a single memory location for that static, how can the
class find something other than the object?  It makes no sense to me that
one object of type A could be shared, and another not, and that this
difference would cause them to find different values in their statics.  
(As an aside, I'm reasonably sure that this would violate spec.)

&gt;<i> - a process should be able to carry on IPC with two different processes
</I>&gt;<i> simultaneously using the same the same class type for both shared
</I>&gt;<i> objects. However, IPC with one process should not interfere with IPC
</I>&gt;<i> with the other. If the Class is shared it cannot be avoided (when
</I>&gt;<i> statics are involved).
</I>
	This is a very good point.  Unfortunately, it opens an enourmous
can of worms dealing with point I mentioned above; how many different
statics for one class can you have?  I would think one!  But in this
scenario, you need at least three -- one for the process-local class, one
for A-B share, and one for the B-C share.  If C and A share another object
of the same type, what happens?  If they share the object shared with B?

	OTOH, looking at the *nix-equivalent scenario, if I share a global
with one process, and then another, it /must/ be share between the two
other processes as well; that is, sharing is transitive in conventional
systems.  (Which is not to say it must be in JOS, but...)

&gt;<i> Unfortunately, it is not a matter of ignoring it and throwing
</I>&gt;<i> LinkageErrors when it happens, because this will affect applications
</I>&gt;<i> even if they are not using shared objects.
</I>
	Urg.  You're right.
