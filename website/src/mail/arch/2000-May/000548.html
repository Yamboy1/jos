<PRE>&gt;<i>Wait! I thought a class definition has no static fields. If it has no
</I>&gt;<i>static fields, it has no link to any superclass. A class definition only
</I>&gt;<i>knows the name of its superclass, not the class definition of its
</I>superclass.

&gt;<i>Let's talk about resolving a class. A class can be resolved. It has static
</I>&gt;<i>fields, like ClassLoader, that help resolve the class. A class definition
</I>&gt;<i>cannot be resolved because that requires static fields. A class definition
</I>&gt;<i>can pre-convert UTF8 fields and convert the external representation of
</I>&gt;<i>other constants to a vm-specific form. It can even pre-compile the Code
</I>&gt;<i>attribute of methods. The pre-compiled code would be platform- and
</I>vm-specific.

Ah.  Here's the heart of the matter for me.  I wasn't understanding what
exactly was meant by &quot;class definition&quot;.  I was under the impression that
this was a kind of intermediate phase in the loading of the Class.  From
the sound of it, a class definition is bytecode which has been loaded by a
class loader and passed to the JVM, but has not yet been resolved (via a
native method).  So then I hear you saying that a class definition is
bytecode associated with a class loader.

It's always nice to speak the same language.  It's even better if you
understand the same language.  Which reminds me, I've got to get back to
programming in GAP (Grunting And Pointing). :-)


&quot;If you lurk long enough, you'll understand.&quot;
