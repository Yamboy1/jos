Yes, it appears that was the case. My sincerest apologies.

I must have missed this sentence in his email. So, Gilbert's idea as /I/
understood it :-) is workable. That is, everything he said, except this
sentence (ie. objects can't be shared just because they have the same
class definition if the classes weren't both loaded by primordial class
loaders).
