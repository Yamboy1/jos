<PRE>&gt;<i> I've followed some of your discussion on sharing objects and the
</I>&gt;<i> implications of static fields.  For perspective, one might look at
</I>&gt;<i> Serialization, which is, in a way, a method of sharing
</I>&gt;<i> objects.  Serialization disregards all static and transient fields of an
</I>&gt;<i> object.  This prevents the serialized object from changing the static
</I>&gt;<i> fields of other instances when it is deserialized.  So shared objects
</I>&gt;<i> could basically have their static fields dependent on the current
</I>&gt;<i> process.  This essentially treats shared objects as deserialized objects.
</I>
It is of course possible to use existing Java IPC methods such as TCP/IP
streams with Serialization or RMI, but these mechanisms are much slower
than sharing a class directly in the JVM.

&gt;<i> How one gets an instance of a shared object is another story. IMO, the
</I>&gt;<i> most elegant way is through an object broker of some kind (whether an ORB
</I>&gt;<i> or subscription of some kind).  That way, the broker could manage the
</I>&gt;<i> sharing and synchronization problems. The broker could exist outside of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;processes&quot; per se, and could be accessed through JNDI or some other
</I>&gt;<i> interface.  
</I>
That's the problem, you need quite a bit of complexity to support it, and
the speed won't be great.

&gt;<i>I don't know if these last comments apply, they're just some
</I>&gt;<i> random speculation on my part.  Since I am not intimately familiar with
</I>&gt;<i> the kernel and VM, I cannot make a precise judgement.
</I>
John
