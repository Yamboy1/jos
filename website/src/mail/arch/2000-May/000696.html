Let's clarify the difference between data sharing and object sharing. Data
sharing is the sharing of (in Java) primative values. Both primatives and
primative arrays can be shared among virtual machines with impunity. Why?
Because the well-known &quot;classes&quot; for primatives are written in machine
code. Data sharing is very easy. Data sharing is akin to shared memory.

A protocol stack needs a mechanism of shared data. It uses the same model
that already exists in a classic virtual machine. A user process sends data
to the protocol stack through the native methods of java.net. A unique copy
of java.net is owned by each bytecode process. A &quot;packet&quot; is an array of
bytes. It is easy to send a packet within a MPCL-compatible virtual
machine. A packet is copied from a user process to the system process, from
the system process to a user process. The implementation of a function like
arraycopy() of the java.lang.System class is implemented the same way no
matter how many primordial class loaders there are.

Data sharing (shared memory) is easy. Object sharing is not so easy.

Objects can be shared by proxy. A proxy mechanism reduces the puzzle to
data sharing again. State informaiton is &quot;shared&quot; -- just like
serialization -- by encoding and decoding primatives. By proxy, the object
&quot;type&quot; remains the same even though the &quot;class&quot; can be different. A class
is an implementation of a type. Each class must be compatible with its
type. A proxy always uses a primative, like an int or long, as a handle to
the real object.

&gt;<i>Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems to me that there needs to be a
</I>&gt;<i>bare minimum object sharing mechanism built into the kernel / process
</I>&gt;<i>system, so that more robust sharing models can be built up from that.  We

</I>
The protocol stack is a bare minimum data sharing mechanism. Once you have
data sharing, you automatically get object sharing by proxy. We can run a
standard CORBA or RMI service on top of a protocol stack. Nothing else is
needed.
