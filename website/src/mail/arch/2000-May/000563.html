<PRE>In one project, I'm using JDK 1.1 because it is the only one available for
OS/400. It depends heavily on the JDBC drivers inside IBM's &quot;AS/400 Toolkit
for Java&quot;.

I was very surprised when this application stopped working on my machine.
It seems that the JDBC drivers inside IBM's &quot;AS/400 Toolkit for Java&quot; do
not work  on my machine with JDK 1.2. The virtual machine from JDK 1.2
locks up, so that even the Control+C signal does not work.

I won't speculate about what IBM will do. I won't guess what part of JDK
1.2 has become incompatible with the JDBC drivers. But I do know this:
backward compatibility is extremely important to my ultra-conservative
corporate customers. They want software that lasts. They do not want to
repeatedly write the same application year after year. There are so many
more applications they would like to write.

As for JOS, I want an operating system that I can use. I can't use an
operating system that requires me to repeatedly write the same applications
each year.
