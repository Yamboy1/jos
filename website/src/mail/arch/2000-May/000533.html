<PRE>	This message concerns Ryan's response to Gilbert's implementation
of object-sharing by proxy/ownership lists.  I feel like I'm missing
something of importance -- I don't find myself concerned by having
multiple 'owners' of an object.  Ownership is a concern of the security
system, rather than of IPC.  (I realize that security has to be built in
from the ground up to really work, but hold on a second here.)  All that
garbage collection cares about is the number of references -- one per
accessor/(shared) owner.  If an object is shared, our security system has
OK'd it, so the 'ownership' of an object doesn't seem particularly
important; security should be checking permissions against the process,
not the object, so having a higher-permission process share an object with
a lower priority class isn't a problem.  (BTW -- I really like the idea
of just re-assigning the classloader property for object passing.)

	Ownership seems to be important only if it confers privileges that
accessors don't have.  Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems like the
processes sharing the object must have equal access to it, because once
the object is shared, the JVM isn't going to call security again, unless
explicitly directed to do so.  Being able to do some things but not others
to an object, without those explicit security checks, also seems like it
would violate the spec.  What am I missing here?
