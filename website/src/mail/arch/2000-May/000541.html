<PRE>&gt;<i> What this means is, it sort of does matter which process owns the
</I>&gt;<i> object, because this reference will stop the real owner of the process
</I>&gt;<i> from being garbage collected if it drops out of the distributed system.
</I>
	OK.  I see why the process which originated object might want to
maintain a reference to the shared object; I don't see that this reference
needs to be any different than any other kind, or have tha distinction
maintained by the kernel.  (Or, necessarily, that having provided a shared
object, it should necessarily persist once it drops out of the disributed
system.)

&gt;<i> It seems like this is the primitive for doing all sorts of stuff related
</I>&gt;<i> to do object ownership. For example, to emulate multiple owners of an
</I>&gt;<i> object, ownership of the object can be re-assigned to an independent
</I>&gt;<i> master process: the(/a) shared object broker.
</I>
	I'm still stuck on the idea of ownership over here.  All I
(still) see a need for is object references.  Even if we were to
implement finer-grained security than by-process, what special priviliges
does the object/process from which the shared object under consideration
came (the 'owner') have, as a matter of kernel-level policy?

&gt;<i> So some methods on the object can be called by process A, some methods
</I>&gt;<i> can be called by process B, and some can be called by both.
</I>
	This is very true.  It is not, however, something that the kernel
needs to concern itself with -- because it's written into the shared
object itself.

	All your points are good, but the connection to ownership
continues to elude me.  Why is 'ownership' a kernel-level primitive?
