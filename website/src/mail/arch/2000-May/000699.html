<PRE>I think the discussion on object sharing between processes is very
interesting, but people aren't necessarily considering one aspect:
What _actually_ needs to be shared?

I believe there are a few obvious things that _need_ to be shared:
* Protocol stack
* Toolkit and other AWT junk
* Other system services

But seriously, these things can be handled with static calls.  I realize
that we are trying to separate processes, but they are still essentially
in the same VM.  The only problem with keeping it all open is the need to
separate multiple users.

If we assume we have a ten-foot thick brick wall like Gilbert suggests,
and those things listed above are provided to each process (either
directly or through proxy), I see no need to &quot;share&quot; objects other than
through message passing.  If what you really want is a way to pass
information, use pipes or FIFOs or messages or sockets.  They can be
implemented so that you achieve nearly the speed of direct sharing,
without worrying about obtaining a lock on an object. Or if you want the
completely-separate approach, use RPC(RMI).

If my argument here is completely off-base, would someone please explain
to me the distinct advantages and uses of direct sharing?
