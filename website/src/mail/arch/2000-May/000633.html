A process API is necessary, yes.
Your subprogram API is useful, but not necessary*.

Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against people using your subprogram
API, but I hope you see why I decided not to implement it in rheise.os.
It is only designed to contain things which are necessary from an
operating system's point of view. On top of the operating system, there
may be other libraries like your subprogram API. Is your subprogram API
really an operating system facility? I didn't think so. It's a library
that certain application developers will choose to use.

(*) it cannot be argued that it is necessary because there are always
alternatives. And alternatives are good.

&gt;<i> Many kinds of subprograms are already possible.
</I>
The existing set of embedded program APIs will do me just fine. So,
maybe a better way to say what you're saying is &quot;Hey, I'm developing a
subprogram API, I hope some of you find it useful in your application
development.&quot;

rather than saying that we should use it and it's necessary (and that I
should give you the functionality in rheise.os, otherwise you can't use
it! By the way, do I get an apology for that remark, or do you still
maintain that rheise.os is a dead-end project?)

&gt;<i> If you want to write a custom program for the JOS Project, you should write
</I>&gt;<i> it as a subprogram, not a Java application. A Java application is only for

</I>
If you want to replace the well established main() method, I think we'll
need a vote. The main reason I chose not to use your program API is that
it doesn't reuse existing standards (ie. main()) when you could have
implemented all of that functionality using existing standards. If you
did so, it would be possible to run any existing application as a
subprogram, without the need of a wrapper class.

&gt;<i> Many applications, like javac, can be run successfully as a subprogram. No

</I>
That is true. If you know what you're doing you can be sure in some
cases that it won't matter if you reuse the class loader of the parent.
Not that it's entirely elegant to be executing legacy applications
counter to the way they were intended. What I was trying to say in my
last email was that a new and improved javac tool could be written that
could be used in this way naturally. That is, rather than writing javac
as a program, it could be written as a library, and there could be a
simple javac program that interfaces to that library if you wish to run
it as a program. Otherwise, your application can invoke methods on the
library directly (which is reusing the class loader just as you're
reusing the class loader - only this time, it was intended to be used
that way).
