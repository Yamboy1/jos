<PRE>&gt;<i> Let's get back to the discussion. The reloading of classes cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> ignored. Each process has its own potentially unique CLASSPATH. So, each
</I>&gt;<i> process must load its own classes.
</I>
That seems to be such a waste. Consider the classic use of processes by a
UNIX shell. When the shell executes a 'ls' process and then a 'grep'
process and then a 'wc' process it actually has to start all these 3
processes.

Now in UNIX creating these processes has to be cheap (precisely because of
this), and the executable code for these processes can be shared by many
instances.

The JVM model is different. Before the JVM can execute a &quot;Process&quot;, which
for me means the &quot;main&quot; method in some class, it has to load that class.
Loading that class means resolving the constant pool and loading all the
classes that it depends on. These are typically classes like
java.lang.System, java.lang.Thread, java.lang.String,
java.lang.StringBuffer and so on.

This whole loading process is not trivial. Some classes might call native
methods while they are initializing (like setting up the file descriptors
for System.in, System.out etc).

This all takes time, much more time than executing a UNIX process like
&quot;ls&quot;.

So if the intention is to model a JOS Process on a UNIX process, we have
to think very carefully about what class definitions we are going to share
across processes.

I think it would be extremely wasteful if each process had to load all
it's own classes from the class library independently of the other
processes.

This makes it difficult to support different class libraries in the
same OS but otherwise has great advantages.

Processes then would also not be able to use a different version of a
class already used by another process.

The solution may be to use ClassLoaders to separate classes that
processes use (but not the class library classes).

&gt;<i> All classes must be unique to a bytecode process. None can
</I>be shared
&gt;<i> without a proxy. Each class in process A must be different than each class
</I>&gt;<i> in process B. When the process is garbage collected, all of its classes are
</I>&gt;<i> garbage collected.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In a classic design, all classes in a virtual machine are discarded when a
</I>&gt;<i> virtual machine dies. In a JNI design, all classes in a virtual machine are
</I>&gt;<i> discarded when a virtual machine dies. Sometimes, these classes are not
</I>&gt;<i> even finalized.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When a Java application runs inside a MPCL-compatible virtual machine, all
</I>&gt;<i> of its classes must be discarded when a process dies. All classes created
</I>&gt;<i> by a process are owned by a process. Everything owned by a process is
</I>&gt;<i> discarded when the process dies.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A process can share objects with any other process, not just the process
</I>&gt;<i> that created it. For more information, see also ParentProcess article on
</I>&gt;<i> JOS Wiki.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -----
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here again are processes A and B. Because each process might have its own
</I>&gt;<i> CLASSPATH, the superclass of a class can change from one process to another.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In one process, I can have this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> public abstract class AbstractWidget {
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> public class CustomWidget
</I>&gt;<i>     extends AbstractWidget {
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> while in another, I can have this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> public abstract class AbstractWidget {
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> public class BasicWidget 
</I>&gt;<i>     extends AbstractWidget {
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> public class CustomWidget
</I>&gt;<i>     extends BasicWidget {
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Both are valid and appropriate within their own process. The CLASSPATH of
</I>&gt;<i> process A can be different than the CLASSPATH of process B.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -----
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A versionless virtual machine is able to adapt at runtime to different
</I>&gt;<i> versions of the Java standard class libraries. The class library is plugged
</I>&gt;<i> into a versionless virtual machine through CLASSPATH. Within a single
</I>&gt;<i> virtual machine, each process is built upon a different platform. One
</I>&gt;<i> process can run Java 2 platform while another runs Java 1.
