Direct sharing has no advantage at all because it can't be done
predictably, reliably or safely. Nobody really wants rogue objects to cross
the persistence barrier. Nobody really wants that kind of security risk.
After you work out all of the &quot;complexities&quot; of direct sharing, you'll find
that (a) you'll have to introduce some form of proxy to get past the
persistence barrier, and (2) at first, you won't recognize it as a proxy at
all (so that you can continue to claim direct sharing).

It cannot be done predictably because high complexity is full of surprises.
It can't be done reliably because such complexities cannot be fully tested.
It cannot be done safely because the design must be fundamentally changed
with each surprise.

The greatest minds in the software industry have been working on it for 50+
years. It has been tried before. Many distributed computing experts agree
with the proxy and protocol stack approach illustrated by the Internet:
TCP/IP, &quot;serialization&quot; and CORBA/RMI services. It is predictable, reliable
and safe because of its simplicity.
