There are two proposals for this. Mine is to have a static reference
resolved via the class loader of the caller. So, we have two &quot;best&quot; ways
to do it, and one is more best than the other :-) We can work out which
one later, though, since there seems to be a lot of threads going on at
the moment (hmm, threads... do we constitute a mailing list operating
system?)

I know of at least two ways to look at process termination (see my
response to Gilbert's mail). So, depending on which way we look at that,
there are different ways to consider how/when a process and its classes
are discarded. I know there is plenty of discussion to be had over the
two ideas... (if we can sustain two conflicting ideas long enough to
find time to discuss them, I think we will have solved our thread
overload problem. Discarding ideas prematurely can be unfortunate, eg.
proxies, statics, process termination, parent processes, and of course,
rheise.os)
