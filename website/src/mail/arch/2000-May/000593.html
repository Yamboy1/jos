In Chapter 13 of &quot;Essential JNI: Java Native Interface&quot; by Rob Gordon,
Prentice Hall PTR, the author demonstrates the use of multiple virtual
machines inside a single machine code process. Each virtual machine is
attached to a different machine code thread.

&gt;<i>I do not know how IBM implemented multiple multiple Java processes, or if it
</I>&gt;<i>is possible to find out. Perhaps, since they (AFAIK) neglected to provide a
</I>&gt;<i>Java-side API for processes, they are runnig disjoint JVMs in a single
</I>&gt;<i>process; your description leads to me to believe that they have discovered or
</I>&gt;<i>implemented an efficient method for sharing class definitions accross those
</I>&gt;<i>JVMs -- could you confirm this? If they have, it is to the loss of the Java
</I>&gt;<i>community that they neglected to tell anyone else (AFAIK) how to do this. If
</I>&gt;<i>they did (or have released source to their JVM), I would be very interested
</I>&gt;<i>in reading it.
</I>
The product I'm using is IBM's Java Development Kit 1.1.6 for OS/400. IBM
and others have published many articles to the AS/400 community. IBM has
published many implementation details on their as400.ibm.com website.

Since OS/400 is already running a virtual machine interface similar to a
Java virtual machine, their product translates from one virtual machine
language to another. Most of the Java support is found in the equivalent of
a pre-compiled dynamically shared library.

Java is a natural on OS/400. The virtual machine interface had already been
done. Long before Java, the entire OS/400 has a single garbage collector.
When OS/400 creates an object reference, it is a system-wide object
reference. Objects are stored on the equivalent of a swap partition. It
already does short- and long-term persistence. Everything is tied directly
into a system-wide virtual memory manager.

&gt;<i>MPCL is a specification for the implementation of more than one Java process
</I>&gt;<i>in an efficient manner.
</I>
MPCL is a proposed for further modifying the Java Virtual Machine
Specification to enable multiple independent bytecode processes. MPCL is
more of a theory than a specification.

&gt;<i>Ryan's 'os' package is the standard (albiet informal) interface to this
</I>&gt;<i>ability.
</I>
Ryan's rheise.os product is one member's implementation. It demonstrates a
small fraction of what is understood about multiple bytecode processes so
far. It is far too premature to adopt rheise.os as a standard for the JOS
Project. It might lead us to a standard. It may be a useful model. It
cannot be taken literally.

Give me something I can use. I can't use rheise.os. Running a Java
application as a subprogram is not equivalent to running a Java application
as a process. If we think of ourselves as finished, we will miss the
greatest opportunity to find the best solution.

For example, a process has no concept of a parent. There is no parent
property inside a process. Only a subprogram has a parent. Only a
subprogram can share real objects with its parent.

And, a basic process has no concept of a user. There is no user property
inside a process. Only a multiple user operating system has a user.

And, a new process must be given its environment. Its entire environment
must be passed to the process manager. A genuine process manager must be
written in machine code, maybe with a bytecode proxy.

The rheise.os product demonstrates many different ideas at the same time.
It is not focused on the bare essentials of creating a bytecode process. We
need a focused, bare essential demonstration of a bytecode process.

We need to create a better test. The test of a genuine bytecode process is
not, as others have said, piping the output from one process to another.
The acid test is far more complicated than that. Piping from one Java
application to another doesn't prove much.

Don't be distracted by rheise.os. It is only a small step along a path that
will lead us to a genuine bytecode process.

-----

Examine the following code. What should happen?

// Demo.java
public class Demo1 {
  public static void main( String[] args ) {
    String cmd = &quot;java Demo2&quot;;
    Runtime.getRuntime().exec( cmd );
    System.exit( 0 );
  }
}

If Demo2 defines a static main() method, it must continue running long
after Demo1 is gone. Demo2 is not accidentally destroyed when a Demo1
invokes System.exit(). The java.lang.Process object is always a proxy to
the real process that's running. It might contain a single
ProcessDescriptor field, enabling it to do things with the real process.

In bytecode, a process manager cannot maintain a reference to real
processes or the real process manager. Like a FileDescriptor, a process
manager might return a ProcessDescriptor. The ProcessDescriptor is passed
back to a process manager to invoke methods of a process.

public ProcessDescriptor {
  public ProcessDescriptor( int v ) {
    pid = v;
  }
  :
  int pid;
}
