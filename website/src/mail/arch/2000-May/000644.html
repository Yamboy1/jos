</I>
As I explained before, a subprogram API is critical to a process API. At
least one subprogram API is necessary in order to create a process. Any
subprogram API will do. A subprogram API is not optional. It is more than
useful; it is required.

Otherwise, a process would have nothing to do. In the fix-up code for a
machine code process, there is a lot of CPU cycles that must be used before
the call to main(). In the fix-up code for a bytecode process, there is
also a lot of CPU cycles that must be used before a call to whatever. There
must be a subprogram API so that a generic process fix-up code &quot;knows&quot; what
to do with a custom subprogram. There must be some API defined.

In a C program, fix-up code looks for a method called _main(...). In a Java
application, fix-up code inside the java/jre tool looks for a method called
main(). The java/jre tool is only an example of one way of doing it. The
Java Native Interface does not require a C/C++ program to look for main(),
nor exclusively use a primordial class loader, nor to invoke a static main().

I am not encouraging or discouraging the use of a subprogram API. I am
pointing out that the Java application uses a subprogram API. Both the
generic fix-up code for a process and a custom Java application must agree.
On the one hand, fix-up code creates four threads, sets up
System.properties (etc), requires a static main() and passes additional
parameters through args. And, a Java application must implement a method
called &quot;main&quot;. Main must have a method access of public and static. Main
must have a method descriptor equal to &quot;(L[java.lang.String;)V&quot;.

This is one way of doing it. It is not the only way.
