<PRE>&gt;<i> A protocol stack needs a mechanism of shared data.
</I>
	Strictly speaking, you only a need IPC, not shared data.  (Unless
I'm accidentally/incorrectly conflating shared data and shared memory.)  
Message-passing will work just fine.  (In the work I've been doing,
message passing is usually the preferred API for data concurrency because
it can be implemented very efficiently for 'inside the box' computing, and
translates very cleanly to the network model for 'outside the box'
computing.  It is, however, more work than data sharing.)

&gt;<i> Data sharing (shared memory) is easy. Object sharing is not so easy.
</I>
	From the programmers P.O.V., I must disagree entirely.  I would
find it much easier to share an object than write de/serialization methods
for it.  If I'm making good use of OOP, I'm working with objects, not
data.

&gt;<i> Objects can be shared by proxy. A proxy mechanism reduces the puzzle
</I>&gt;<i> to data sharing again.
</I>
	What happens if we generate a JavaObject on the share, as if a
'new' instruction were executed, but with its instance variable pointer
the same as the shared object's?  Clearly, the proxy would automatically
synchronize with the shared object.  The type safety of each JVM is
guaranteed because neither JVM uses the other's class(es).  (Though their
definitions/bytecode may be shared.)  The only requirement imposed by
sharing instance data is that the two classes have identical fields in
identical locations; otherwise, the JVM's behavior will be erroneous.

	We could then consider ensuring 'correct' behavior across the two
processes the domain of library or application code.  (However one might
ensure that the classes (methods) loaded by two different process are the
same; the API is still indeterminate/undecided.)  This would include
ensuring 'proper' parent classes.

	Two questions remain.  First, what about objects whose fields are
in turn objects?  Second, what about statics?

	Shared objects must recurse if they are to be transparent.  
Before an operation can be performed with or on an object, its reference
must be pushed onto the operand stack.  This provides an opportunity to
check if that reference is inside the current process.  (That is, if it
has the same (primordial) classloader as the method's class.)  If it's
not, we execute an implicit share.  (Yes, this means our security model
can't be as tight as would be otherwise, since this share must succeed.)  
Otherwise, since objects and (these) proxies are indistinguishable, we
just carry on.

	This does, however, mean that the proxy will be accessing the
statics within its process.  We may be able to work around this; I wanted
to get the idea out and checked for big gaping holes before I spent too
much time on it.  The key thing that makes this look like a good idea may
be that it's less restrictive than the object sharing we had been
discussing, but less objectionable than an explicity proxy approach.

	Gilbert, if you've been advocating an implicit proxy approach, my
apologies.  It would, however, make your positions on what to do more
clear (and convincing) if they included how to do, as well.

* By which I mean, once the object is acquired, it behaves identically to
a non-shared object.

** RMI uses by-value rather than by-reference parameter
passing; additional exceptions are defined for RMI method invocations; RMI
only works for interfaces; and there are limitations on remote objects
passed as arguments to an RMI invocation.
