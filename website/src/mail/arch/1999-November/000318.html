<PRE>&gt;<i> &quot;A kernel does not an operating system make,&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I (Iain) said that.  It was intended to be said with a Yoda (Star 
</I>&gt;<i> Wars) accent.  :)  
</I>
It makes more sense like that :)

&gt;<i> I agree that the focus seems to be very lopsided 
</I>&gt;<i> on the kernel.  I see several JOSystem problems that working 
</I>&gt;<i> groups IMHO should be attacking now.  They will be useful with or 
</I>&gt;<i> without the rest of the JOS system and will help all java 
</I>&gt;<i> installations.  And they can be developed on any jdk available now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) a standardized install/uninstall api for java applications.  ala 
</I>&gt;<i> Installshield on Win32 and sorta RPM on linux.  The installs should 
</I>&gt;<i> actually target classfile -&gt; logical_location mappings so each 
</I>&gt;<i> platform can map the logical_location to appropriate filesystem, 
</I>&gt;<i> classpath, registry, database or whatever mechanisms to store the 
</I>&gt;<i> the classfile and enable loading of the class path.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) shared library manager.  Basically a way to avoid the DLL hell 
</I>&gt;<i> that plagues Win32.  That is, a platform neutral way to load the 
</I>&gt;<i> correct classes with the correct programs taking into account 
</I>&gt;<i> versions of libraries, etc.  Such a system may require a rewrite of 
</I>&gt;<i> the classloader.  Ideally, new versions of shared code will 
</I>&gt;<i> _supplement_ and not replace older versions.  Applications will 
</I>&gt;<i> attempt operation using the new version (to gain enhancements) 
</I>&gt;<i> but failures will cause them to automatically revert to using the 
</I>&gt;<i> older (known good) version.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) package manager/launcher - a method to specify and group 
</I>&gt;<i> classfiles together logically without having to do so physically (jar 
</I>&gt;<i> them) for managament and application launching.  This gives users 
</I>&gt;<i> a view of packages as &quot;single exe&quot; looking entities.  This is cleaner 
</I>&gt;<i> and what I image was intended with &quot;executable jars&quot; but allows us 
</I>&gt;<i> to continue to share code (and eliminate redundant copies of 
</I>&gt;<i> classes).
</I>
I think Gilbert's package files are an easier/faster way to do that, but I think doing both would probably the best solution overall
 
&gt;<i> &gt; Give people what they want. Most people are curious about JOS. They want to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; take it for a test drive. They don't care how fast it is. They just want to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see what it might be like, comparing it to the OS they already have.
</I>
We should have a big red sign saying: &quot;THE REAL ONE IS FASTER!!!&quot;; so they don't ignore it based upon performance.
 
&gt;<i> This I think is actually most dependent on the UI group actually 
</I>&gt;<i> generating a desktop.  Watching printf debug messages crank gets 
</I>&gt;<i> really tiring and is certainly not very impressive!  I think just 
</I>&gt;<i> screenshots from a new UI would get more people more excited 
</I>&gt;<i> about JOS than probably even a shipping kernel with no GUI 
</I>&gt;<i> support.  And, the UI list has been ghostly silent recently.
</I>
I agree, but its silent because most of what we need is in JOSystem (stuff like launching applications and access to devices and drivers and the like).

Cheers,
DigiGod
