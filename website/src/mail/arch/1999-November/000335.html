<PRE>To follow up on the &quot;module&quot; environment, it is quite possible for any JVM
to be a &quot;module&quot; running in this environment. The Ultimate JOS should be
able to load all three Java platforms as JOSBox &quot;modules&quot;.

One or more JVM &quot;modules&quot; is selected from all the JVM &quot;modules&quot; installed
on a machine during kernel/module configuration. I think at least one JVM
&quot;module&quot; is required. In turn, the JVM &quot;modules&quot; would be able to share THE
memory manager &quot;module&quot; that gives the kernel the ability to allocate and
free virtual memory. All JVM &quot;modules&quot; might also share a bytecode cache.

From the domain point of view, only one JVM can be the &quot;primary&quot; domain,
where all of the bytecode &quot;device drivers&quot; live. The primary domain asks
the kernel to create new instances of secondary domains for additional
users (in a multiple user OS) and additional &quot;processes&quot; (in a multiple
process OS).

If you have no reason to ever use the Java 0 Platform, you don't need the
Java 0 &quot;module&quot; installed in your JOSBox (or JOS machine). But for those
that do, they can install the Java 0 &quot;module&quot; in the JOSBox and enjoy Java
0 applications.

If you're not ready to use the Java 3 Platform, you don't need the Java 3
&quot;module&quot; installed in your JOSBox. But for those hearty souls that live on
the bleeding edge, they can install a Java 3 &quot;module&quot; and enjoy their Java
3 applications.

I believe this is where a lot of the simplicity of JOS architecture is
found. There are only a few &quot;modules&quot; necessary when most of the operating
system is written with bytecode.

How do we create &quot;modules&quot;? Anybody that can create a shared library for
Linux or dynamic link library for Windows can create a &quot;module&quot; for JOS.
The &quot;module&quot; is called by bytecode. The &quot;module&quot; itself contains no bytecode.

Inside a JVM, loadLibrary() would call create_module_instance(). The
bytecode would use an instance handle for a &quot;module&quot; running in the JOSBox.
Only the kernel would use load_module() to load and initialize a module.
Once the bytecode has a module instance, it would use it like it might use
a shared library. When we create a bytecode/native code interface that's
fast, you would see great improvements over the performance of Java 1 and 2.

It is natural. It would strongly encourage JOS programmers to write
bytecode for everything.
