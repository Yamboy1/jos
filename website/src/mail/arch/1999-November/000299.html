<PRE>Simple JOS is one example of Transitional JOS. You can run JOS on Linux
today, with Simple JOS. It is unfortunate that there has been so little
focus on transitional JOS that it isn't much to look at. There are
subsystems that are just waiting for application programmers to build a
better desktop.

I am working on the Ultimate Browser. It isn't much to look at. I am a
system programmer (and architect). I am not an application programmer. The
ultimate browser includes a toolbar to switch your view:

 - applet browser
 - plain text browser
 - program browser
 - property browser
 - servlet browser
 - stream tokenizer browser

The Ultimate Browser could benefit from a design with more bitmapped
graphics. It might be a good idea to have a version that runs under Swing.

The more complex HTML browser is a glaring omission. The Ultimate Browser
shows off other JOS subsystems, written in pure Java that can run on
Ultimate JOS and other JREs. The Smart API serves up all kinds of digital
resources. When the time comes, your application program can be smaller,
more powerful and benefit from Smart API configuration. The package manager
custom class loader finds bytecode locally and across the network (and
Internet). You just run programs; you don't &quot;install&quot; them. JOS might be
the last program you ever have to &quot;install&quot;.

Other subsystems show how it might be possible to create a JOS &quot;partition&quot;
on Linux or Windows that manages JOS data as if it were a block device,
manage commands on the JOS command line (like clUtilities), build reuable
programs, maintain Java source code, expand the idea of an editor (like Jext).

I wonder how many people on the JOS Project are aware of how much Java code
has already been written, how much will already run on any Java virtual
machine, how much work has been done to refine the architecture and models
needed for multiple user security, system-wide and network-wide
configuration, distributed computing, and others.

The JOS 1d Technical Distribution was downloaded 240+ times in October. The
JJOS kernel was downloaded more than anything else. Is it because the JJOS
kernel is better than anything else? Or rather, is it because the JJOS
kernel has been discussed on this and other forums more than anything else?

People are talking about the JOS kernel. There is far more to JOS than
kernels. &quot;A kernel does not an operating system make,&quot; said someone on the
JOS Wiki. (Who said that?) JOS is a sum of all its parts, its kernel, its
JOSBox, its JOSystem. The JOSBox and JOSystem should not continue to have a
low priority while the kernel is being built.

I wish Ultimate JOS were ready. I wish I could run it on my JOS machine. No
matter how hard I have wished for it, JOS is difficult to get up and
running -- even with the JOS 1d Binary Distribution.

Imagine the JOS kernel were ready today. What else would we be working on?
I ask that question all of the time. We should be working on the
Transitional JOS, the one that helps people see the potential of JOS for
themselves. They can take Transitional JOS for a test drive. See what it
might looks like.

Speed is irrelevant for this kind of test drive. Transitional JOS is
expected to run as fast as other Java applications. It isn't expected to
run as fast as non-portable native programs. The fact that it runs on 17+
platforms is most amazing. The fact that consumers do not have to give up
anything in order to use JOS on their native OS is the strongest selling
point.

Efficiency is irrelevant for this kind of test drive. When you are trying
to teach people how to use the tool, you can afford more time than when you
are trying to use the tool to do real work. Better tools are so good that
you can afford for them to be a little less efficient -- they are far more
effective.

Give people what they want. Most people are curious about JOS. They want to
take it for a test drive. They don't care how fast it is. They just want to
see what it might be like, comparing it to the OS they already have.
