<PRE>&gt;<i> While the JOSystem can be &quot;faked&quot; to debug this application, it make sense
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;fake&quot; it permanently. If JOSystem will run on Linux, Mac, Windows,
</I>&gt;<i> OS/400, why not run it anywhere?
</I>
	Because &quot;faking&quot; your back-end support leads to problems with
stability, speed and generally requires great mounds of platform-specific
code to work in the general case.  If you're going to write
platform-specific code, why not write it for the platform specifically
designed to support it?

	As I've mentioned before, I have doubts about the ability of the
JOS front-end to meet its full potential running on systems other than its
own back-end.

&gt;<i> Why should the give up their legacy applications when they don't have to?
</I>
	Mu.  We don't know yet that they won't have to.  And besides,
daul-booting O/Ses is not too terribly complicated, nor is it difficult to
set up -- in fact, the next wave of Linux distros looks like it's going to
automate the process for you.  And while daul-booting OSes is annoying,
writing interoperability software so that the 'Transitional JOS' works
with your native OS apps is nontrivial and fraught with the same dangers
that writing interop code is.
