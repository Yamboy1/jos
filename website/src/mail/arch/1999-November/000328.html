Windows 3.1 was a necessary evil for Microsoft. Without Windows 3.1 running
on top of MS-DOS, there would be no demand for Windows 95, 98 or 2000
today. It would be something else. It might have been better. It might have
been worse. But, it would have definitely been different.

Microsoft had a brief moment of marketing savy with Windows 3.1 because
they told their corporate customers that Windows 3.1 was good and optional.
&quot;You don't have to use it if you don't want to,&quot; they said. Imagine a time
when Microsoft was offering a &quot;choice&quot;. But the &quot;choice&quot; wasn't real.
Microsoft strong-armed their customers into using Windows. How? They
stopped working on MS-DOS. They discontinued it. In spite of great demand
for MS-DOS and Linux, Microsoft insisted that your machine has to waste
over 80% of its processing power on Windows. People wanted 32-bit MS-DOS.
They were willing to install Windows 95 to get it.

That is the last time Microsoft did anything savy. They don't understand
why Windows 95 was a success follow up to Windows 3.1 and Windows 98 was
dead-on-arrival. They have been deaf to the demands of the marketplace.
That's why everyone is ready for a new OS. And it ain't Linux either.

&gt;<i>people knew DOS.
</I>
Don't underestimate the power of what people already know. See how Java
became successful because people knew C/C++. See how Linux became
successful because lots of people already knew UNIX. Lots of people --
frustrated with their old operating system -- wanted to take UNIX for a
test drive.

&gt;<i>They were familiar with DOS.
</I>
Don't underestimate the power of comfort. People don't like surprises. They
are familiar with low quality software. Some have only known low quality
software. They get complacent and comfortable with a familiar routine. Some
people have grown complacent with rebooting Microsoft Windows two or three
times a day. In fact, the Atlanta-Journal/Constitution published an article
last month that says, &quot;You should expect your operating system to crash two
or three times a day. It's normal. Don't call for support.&quot;

But it's not normal. It is unacceptable. People don't have high
expectations of an operating system after using Microsoft Windows for a
while. They lost the will to fight.

&gt;<i>They didn't want to switch to a whole new operating system which had
</I>&gt;<i>unknown support and features.
</I>
Just as the market resisted Windows 3.1, the market must resist JOS. People
don't like the unknown. There is no way to predict the future when the
facts are unknown. What is JOS exactly? Nobody knows. We know what it might
be. We know of its potential to be something great.

Switching to OS/2 was frightening because it was unknown and unknowable.
DR-DOS was promoted by Microsoft as a Very Bad Thing. Microsoft made it
more frightening. People trusted Microsoft to lead them to best practice.
Microsoft lead them astray.

&gt;<i>But Win 3.1 added features that DOS by itself didn't have.
</I>
People would rather fight than switch. They would rather stay with their
stupid operating system than upgrade to a new OS. What will it take? JOS
must have a compelling reason -- beyond the reasons for Linux -- in order
for people to take the first step.

Don't scare people with a cry of revolution. We must use evolution, not
revolution. While the added value of JOS must be compelling, it also must
be safe and non-threatening.

Why not Linux? Linux is great for some people. Linux is a leap away from
Windows. While Linux has great people working on it, it will always be too
much of a leap away from Windows. You can't get there from here.

Like Java-Linux, JOS has the potential to be some sort of middle ground. It
can be familiar to all those using Windows *and* everyone using Linux. JOS
might be the &quot;right&quot; answer to the needs of a mass market, especially a new
market of single console/multiple processors and serverfarm-in-a-box.

IBM is transforming its AS/400 into a perfect Java virtual machine. They
see what the next generation of software is going to look like. Like
always, IBM will wait until after the market &quot;grows-up&quot; before announcing
any products.

On the other hand, Microsoft is only familiar with for-fee licensing.
Microsoft employees are told that making copies of software is always
illegal and unethical. Microsoft is familiar with operating a monopoly.
Rather than switch to the new mass market reality, Microsoft is trying to
fight it. They have done irreparable harm to their own reputation.

If it weren't for the year 2000 thing, we might have planned ahead for
changes in the mass market. But alas, life after 2000 is unpredictable.
