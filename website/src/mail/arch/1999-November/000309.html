<PRE>&gt;<i>The first thing to do is identify what we need to get started. What
</I>&gt;<i>exactly do we want to implement first, and how can we generate the
</I>&gt;<i>necessary input / output to test what we're writing? 
</I>
First thing to do is usually to get all the eth. packets received through a
function/method that examines them. This method decides wether they are
handled (in case of ARP RARP or IP) or discarded, and pass them to their
respective handlers.
This could be implemented modularly so new protocols can be added without
modifying the code, simply by adding another instance of a &quot;protocol&quot; class
into a suitable structure.

Next would be to get ARP and RARP working to map IPs onto MAC adresses and
finally the IP stuff, which will be pretty hairy (think routing,
fragmentation and reassembly, errors via ICMP etc.)
Now we should have something semi-useable.
Adding in UDP should be trivial at this stage, for it just a very thin
layer on top of IP.
The TCP is going to prove even hairier than IP, but that's for later worries :)

The very important thing (as in all OO projects) is to have a good
interface definition to the visible objects.
Sun has defined TCP and UDP classes, i just suggest we implement those when
we get there. There's however still a lot of room to improvise.

&gt;<i>At this stage it might be a good idea to just use Linux to provide the
</I>&gt;<i>lower networking layers, and feed the data into a Java app.
</I>
While this is undoubtedly a good idea, we need a couple of native methods
to implement some serious black magic, and i'm not much of a linux device
wizard. I'm willing to experiment though :)
We need to make this &quot;black magic class&quot; compatible with the &quot;jos driver
interface for block devices&quot; if such a thing exists, and then plugging it
into the kernel should be fairly painless.

Keep up the brainstorm!
Ranieri.

PS: are we expected to have garbage collection for the tcp/ip stack?
