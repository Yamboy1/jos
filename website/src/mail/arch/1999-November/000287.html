<PRE>I am new to the JOS project, so please excuse my ignorance if this 
topic has been discussed in the past:

	I believe that it is counterproductive in this day and age to 
create an application or operating system that can only run on a 
handful of processor types, ie, x86 etc...  The reason that Java is 
so revoloutionary is that it is able to run in a runtime environment 
inside of any operating system.  I understand that this project would 
eliminate the need for a runtime, but I do not see why we should 
focus our efforts on only Pentium class processors.  I personaly use 
a Mac, a PC, and a SGI, and of those I like my Mac the best.  I would 
love to see a Java operating system for the PowerPC, especially now 
that IBM is working extensively with it in an attempt to incorperate 
it into different types of systems.  I am willing to help on this 
indevor, but I will need a plethora of people who are willing to try 
to develop this system, not just for the PC people of the world, but 
the people of the world in general.
