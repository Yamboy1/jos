<PRE>From:           	Ryan Heise &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ryan@whitewolf.com.au">ryan@whitewolf.com.au</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> It would be nice
</I>&gt;<i> to have an automated tool to build all products. We could have marker
</I>&gt;<i> files in CVS that declare what product this directory belongs to.
</I>
Actually, I've been hoping to add this to the updated JOS website 
but work has conspired to slow me down on my JOS website 
work...  If anyone is interested in helping, or have ideas I'd love to 
hear from you.  

What I was thinking was an automated Build Manager tool.  It 
would let designated &quot;build managers&quot; check sources out of CVS 
build them on your local machine (I'd hate to have the JOS 
webserver bogged down compiling code) and then upload the 
&quot;products&quot; (jar's, class files, javadoc html, etc) to &quot;standard&quot; 
locations where people can download/browse them.  (Obviously it's 
the &quot;product upload&quot; capability that would be restricted to build 
managers, cvs dowload is already available to anyone).  A really 
ambitious project would also develop a tool (in java) that would 
automate this task for the build managers.  :)  

Right now just getting wiki integrated into the website is enough to 
keep me pulling hairs.  :(
