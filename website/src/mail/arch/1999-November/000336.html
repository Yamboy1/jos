<PRE>	When originally joining this project I had the misconception 
that JOS would be more like Linux than Virtual PC.  Upon a few 
discussions via this mailing list it was clarified to me that this 
was indeed not the case.  The purpose of JOS (right now) is to 
develop an operating system that can run inside of an existing OS, 
ie, Mac or Win9x.  I would just like to clarify once and for all that 
this is the case.  That for the moment, we are all focusing on a 
product that can run on everyone's macheine without needing to be the 
only operating system running.  I do now see the advantages of this, 
but I would just like final clarity that this is the case.
