<PRE>&gt;<i>I'm interested in doing the TCP/IP stack for the JOS... anybody want to
</I>hop on ???

I bought &quot;Internetworking with tcp/ip vol 2: Implementation&quot; a while ago,
and while i read it from cover to cover several times, i figured i was
never going to write a tcp/ip protocol stack, cause all the OS's i knew at
the time already had one, and i wasn't going to be megalomaniac enough to
start a new one.

Now it looks like a decent opportunity has presented itself.
I would definately like to collaborate on this project.

The only thing that comes to mind is that it would be a Good Thing to have
a network card driver handy.. has jos already progressed to the level where
one is included? Can we &quot;steal&quot; it from somewhere? 

Ranieri.
