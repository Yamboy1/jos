<PRE>&gt;<i> Here! Here! I hear a lot of discussion about a native kernel. JOS
</I>&gt;<i> architecture does not require a native kernel.
</I>
	This is a dangerous misconception.  Maintaining compatibility with
extant JVMs below the application level is a great way to cripple JOS's
potential.  It's an operating system -- its job is to provide hardware
services to its applications.  Restricting these services to those can be
provided only on a conventional JVM reduces JOS to a none-too-useful
operating enviroment.  That is, it won't be doing anything that's not
already possible under conventional JVM, and the design limits inherent in
the JVM are difficult at best to circumvent, and in many cases well-nigh
impossible without its source code -- which defeats the point of
maintaining compatibility with extant JVMs!

	If JOS is to run as a process (or processes) on some other O/S,
how can it possibly provide the stability, speed, or services of its full
potential?  (Windows will crash on its own and kill JOS for us.  Ditto the
Macintosh; Linux doesn't crash as it is, so JOS would only slow your UI
down if you're using it.)  Java is already slow, even with the latest and
greatest of JIT or dynamic compilers.  A large portion of that sloth comes
from making native calls to actually get the work done (that is, JNI has
an enourmous overhead).  The native kernel / native JVM combination
doesn't suffer from this problem -- for instance, graphics (will) NEVER
make a native call, because the kernel provides java with a MappedArray
(tentative name) where the initial byte is at a given address (0xb0000)
and doesn't move; the bytecode assigning a value to an offset in that
array writes directly to the relevant physical location. (The VGA frame
buffer -- other architectures, obviously, differ.)  How does dynamic
device handling work if there's some host O/S to fight for control of the
hardware?

	If I sit down at an NT box running your vision of JOS, what makes
JOS worthwhile compared to running an X client on that NT box?  To
maintain the same desktop accross your multiple computers, you need a
network anyway.  What makes it different than VNC, or pcAnywhere?  If JOS
runs locally, what makes it superior to daul-booting into some other
operating system better suited to your needs?  Running apps in different
windows?  To interoperate, JOS would need large native libraries, which
would seem to ruin the point.  If you're really hard up for running Word
97 in one window and some (java-only, remember!) application in another,
why not convert your extra boxes (Mac, Linux, Win9x, IIRC from your
example) into an X server and install the java binary there -- it'll run
much faster on the remote machine.
	Both Corel and Sun tried and failed to port major office suites to
straight-up normal Java; I don't think people will be attracted to JOS on
the strength of its applications if they're limited in the same ways that
prevented Sun and Corel from selling their ports.  Now, you may say, but
Sun gave up on JavaOS for Business, too, why should we still work on JOS?
Sun targeted JavaOS/B at thin clients, which we all know to have flopped
horribly.  I believe the last effort at a truly object-oriented operating
system were the LispMachines, or possibly some of the Smalltalk systems,
both of which were designed by programmers for programmers, not for
desktops used by Joe White-Collar.
	There is definitely a place for JOS, a robust and reasonably
efficient OS designed in the spirit of the realization that the best
server OSes do not make the best client OSes.  Much of what KDE and GNOME
are trying to do in C and C++ with KParts and CORBA and the like are
facilities that exist in remarkable power and simplicity in Java already;
ditto technologies like OLE and DCOM from the Windows side of things. With
windows comes unreliability; with Linux comes an enourmous complexity and
a design philosophy for power users that prevents things as intuitive as
the delete and backspace keys working in a uniform way from happening
without user intervention and (with each new application) maintenance, and
other things that are so archaic as to be idiotic.  (Pick your favorite;
among mine is the static /dev directory, which was fine idea before the
time when you could add and remove hardware as the system was running.)

	It makes good sense to write code now that runs on extant JVMs,
because a lot of the services and applications (daemons, etc) that will be
distributed with JOS only need to access a particular other set of
services (aka JOSSystem, I believe), and these can be faked to debug the
code you're writing -- which means you don't have to sit idle if you can't
help us over in kernel land.  However, don't let your ambitions be bound
by the limitations of current JVMs and OSes; we can do better.  That's
kind of the point.
