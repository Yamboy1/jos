I have been thinking about working groups. All working groups need to work
together. I can see how maintaining the website has direct impact on Source
Server. Source Server has direct impact on distributing source code.

All classes are unique so far. We must work hard to keep it that way.
Maintaining a CVS server has direct imact on distributing source code, too.
From my inventory, there are no classes inside CVS that are also inside
Source Server.

I believe that all members of the JOS Project should have direct and
uninhibited access to the raw, as submitted, source code. What does this
mean? It means that the Right Thing to do is take the source code you found
and put it inside an archive (such as jos1c-srcserv-1.tgz and
jos1c-srcserv-1.zip). Put the archive on the JOS website at
<A HREF="http://www.jos.org/download/">http://www.jos.org/download/</A>

IF you found source code that has already been archived, the archive itself
should be put inside the distribution. You should *not* re-archive the
source code.

&quot;JOS 1a&quot;, &quot;JOS 1b&quot; and &quot;JOS 1c&quot; are older than &quot;JOS 1d&quot;.

I use &quot;you&quot; loosely. I mean someone must make the original code available
to members of the JOS Project. By making it available to everyone --
equally -- I can download a copy, too.

Thanks,


</pre>
