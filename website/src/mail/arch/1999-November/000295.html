&gt;<i> This is a dangerous misconception.
</I>
Misconceptions don't go away by themselves. It requires a great deal of
discussion to put a misconception to rest. The architecture mailing list is
a forum for discussing the possible architecture of JOS. Cutting short a
discussion about alternative architectures isn't helpful.

What is the misconception again? Is it that JOS has nothing at all written
in Java bytecode? Or, is it that JOS has nothing worthwhile to offer
separate from a native JOS kernel?

&gt;<i> Maintaining compatibility with extant JVMs below the application level
</I>&gt;<i> is a great way to cripple JOS's potential.
</I>
We both want JOS to live up to its potential. While you might be thinking
about the ultimate JOS that should be available in 2 to 3 years, I am
thinking about the transition required to move from 17+ native platforms to
the ultimate JOS platform.

We are writing JOS in parallel. By writing JOS in parallel, we can reach
the full potential of JOS in the shortest amount of time.

Native operating systems, like Mac OS, Microsoft Windows, Linux and OS/400,
aren't going to go away any time soon -- if ever. JOS cannot live up to its
potential if you eliminate every consumer that wants to benefit from their
investment in their native OS.

Linux is popular because it provides a transition to a new operating system
while using existing IBM PC-compatible hardware. It looks a lot like UNIX.
That is important because consumers want to benefit from their investment
in UNIX.

Java itself is popular because it provides a transition to a new
platform-independent platform. It looks a lot like C/C++. That is important
because consumers want to benefit from their investment in C/C++.

Of course, you're right. The JOS that runs on some other OS cannot provide
the stability, speed or services of the ultimate JOS. JOS is just like Java
in this regard. If the native OS crashes, a Java virtual machine crashes.

Linux is recommended as a native OS for JOS. Linux doesn't crash like
Windows or the Mac. Since the Linus OS works and Ultimate JOS doesn't, it
is easy to see how I might like Linux better. The Transitional JOS runs
Java applications just like Ultimate JOS. And Transitional JOS runs now; it
does not have to wait until the JOS kernel or multiple process JVM is
finished.

&gt;<i> Java is already slow...
</I>
You're talking about the future. I'm talking about the present.

You're comparing the potential of Ultimate JOS to the history of other
virtual machine. How fast is Ultimate JOS today? It's the slowest possible
platform because it doesn't run.

Personally, I am pleased with the performance of IBM's JDK 1.1.6 for the
OS/400. It gets the job done. Others seem to be pleased with the
performance reported by TowerJ, an ahead-of-time compiler for Linux, and
the performance of IBM's JDK 1.1.8 for Linux.

They don't need a new OS to run their Java applications today.

I am helping build Ultimate JOS. But we aren't there yet. It is healthy to
discuss what we can do now make the most stable, robust, rugged, high
quality Java applications now so that they will be ready to run on Ultimate
JOS when the time comes.

I think it is a misconception that the JOS Project must wait until the
Ultimate JOS is finished to start work on the development and distribution
of JOS-specific architectures, models programs and APIs. We have a lot of
work to do in order to catch up with operating systems available five years
ago.

We must work hard. We must work in parallel. Every piece of our operating
system is important, not just the kernel or JVM. All of this work has to be
done so that consumers can choose the operating system that gives them the
greatest benefits.

&gt;<i> What makes JOS worthwhile compared to running an X client on that NT box?
</I>
Java is worthwhile. It provides an excellent architecture for
platform-independence. You can run the same application on NT as you run on
a Mac or Linux.

Just as Java is worthwhile, JOS is worthwhile. JOS installs on an NT box
without an X client. JOS is self-contained. JOS is extendable,
network-aware and portable. Unlike Java, JOS provides the greatest level of
backward compatibility and future orientation. It provides all of the
OS-related things that are missing from the Java class libraries.

Your JOS program can read configuration information through a well-known
registry interface across all platforms. While on Linux, you can read/write
.conf files. While on Windows, you can read/write .ini files. While on a
Java platform, you can read/write .properties files. The registry interface
stays the same regardless of the file format.

&gt;<i> If JOS runs locally, what makes it superior to daul-booting into some
</I>&gt;<i> other operating system better suited to your needs?
</I>
Java applications that use JOS subsystems will benefit from most -- by not
all -- of these innovations. JOS subsystems are superior to other operating
systems. JOS subsystems rely on well-known interfaces. JOS depends on Java
bytecode to do most of the GUI and application-specific work. Bytecode is
consistently stored, distributed and interpreted under JOS.

Today, JOS has a unified model for independence from different Java
platforms. It embraces your extreme customization of the OS. It uses
loosely-couple class libraries, package files, registries, factories and
experimental models and frameworks. It incorporates all of the benefits of
a native platform-independent virtual machine.

&gt;<i> Both Corel and Sun tried and failed to port major office suites to
</I>&gt;<i> straight-up normal Java;
</I>
Don't forget Lotus and their brain-dead e-Suite.

We can learn from Corel, Sun and Lotus. Their failure is not an indication
of our failure. Corel dependend on Sun's object serialization to store
data. Sun changed their serialization API rendering all Corel's data
useless. Serialization is not required by Java.

We can learn from Corel's experience with Sun's serialization. Java did not
require Sun to put new serialization in an old namespace. Java did not
require Sun to put serialization into core Java class libraries. If Sun
would have produced backward compatible class libraries, Corel and others
might be far more successful today.

Lotus asked their customers to use a scaled-down version of their
applications. Customer rejected that. Scaled-down applications are not
required by Java.

We can learn from Lotus' experience. We should offer full featured,
comparable applications that run on JOS, both Transitional JOS and Ultimate
JOS. Who is going to build them? If our JOS development is single threaded,
we would have to start JOS application development after Ultimate JOS is
finished.

Of course, JOS development is in parallel. Every Java application
programmer is building an application that will also run on JOS. When
Ultimate JOS is ready, it will be so easy for people to migrate from
whatever they have to Ultimate JOS.

Oracle, IBM and Sun gave up on the network computer. They gave up on JavaOS
for Business. They offered a product for a very small market. Neither a
network nor a network computer is required by Java.

We can learn from the network computer experience. Consumers do not want
network-dependent machines; they want network-aware machines. A network
dependent machine can't run at all without a network. A network-aware
machine uses a network if one is available.

I want to boot JOS from a 500MB hard drive. While my JOS machine has one, a
NIC should not be required. All of the TCP/IP services should run on a
laptop, too.

While you might feel strongly that Utlimate JOS is the best operating
system ever created (and I would agree), consumers must deal with issues of
here and now. They already bought a native OS. Why should they learn
another one?

At this point, there are many consumers getting ready to invest the rest of
their hard earned money to &quot;upgrade&quot; to Windows 2000. Consumers will get
the same thing they already have: an OS that is going nowhere. They are
expected to spend real money to &quot;upgrade&quot; all of the software they already
have. And for what? To find that, while their situation has changed, it
isn't better.

Consumers don't want more excuses. They want software that works. They have
heard the story too many times that their next OS is going to work right
this time.

A. No double the Java virtual machine will run on Windows 2000. It will
crash when Windows 2000 crashes. Every program written in Java will run on
Windows 2000. Every Java-based subsystem in JOS will run on Windows 2000, too.

People are going to be disappointed in Windows 2000 when they figure out
that Microsoft's attitude hasn't changed. They still believe in for-fee
licensing for low quality software. Their formula has worked for many years
because there was no competition.

JOS is Microsoft's worst nightmare come true. Microsoft hopes that we don't
figure out how to make JOS run on Windows. Once JOS runs on top of Windows,
consumers can run Windows and JOS. Consumers will have the best of both
worlds.

And when Ultimate JOS is ready, all those programmers, all those full
features applications and all those consumers will be ready too. They will
know how to use JOS even when a native OS isn't there anymore.

Since we want JOS to reach its full potential, we must make it easy for
consumers to transition from their native OS to JOS. The Java runtime
environment is a perfect transitional platform. Each programmer, each
machine, each person must make the transition. It adds up over time. A
mass-market transition takes years. If we start now, promoting the
transitional JOS as the right answer, the market will be well groomed for
Ultimate JOS by the time it's done.

We can get a lot of help from the rest of the software industry by
remaining neutral to the issue of native platform. We can distribute
products people can use today, such as

 - JOS for Windows 2000
 - JOS for Mac OS 10
 - JOS for OS/400 R5
 - JOS for Linux

and save the marketing blitz for ultimate JOS until after everybody has a
&quot;slow&quot; copy running on their native OS. How will the mass market see that
Ultimate JOS is faster? They can compare Transitional JOS and Ultimate JOS
side-by-side on their own hardware.

While OS would you choose?
