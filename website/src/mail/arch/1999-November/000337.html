<PRE>Jake,

As far as it is concerned for myself and several others in the project, this
is NOT the case.  Some believe this is a good thing.  It is still a matter
of debate.  If this were to happen, it would take some developers writing
code to make this happen.  As it is, no developers who are writing code are
writing it to make this happen.  As far as an 'official' position of the JOS
organization, there isn't one.  The only thing official in this organization
at this point is the Constitution and Policy Book.

Please note that I am not trying to start a flame war, but only clarify the
current status of this topic.

Regards,
Avery J. Regier

</I>&gt;<i> 	When originally joining this project I had the misconception 
</I>&gt;<i> that JOS would be more like Linux than Virtual PC.  Upon a few 
</I>&gt;<i> discussions via this mailing list it was clarified to me that this 
</I>&gt;<i> was indeed not the case.  The purpose of JOS (right now) is to 
</I>&gt;<i> develop an operating system that can run inside of an existing OS, 
</I>&gt;<i> ie, Mac or Win9x.  I would just like to clarify once and for all that 
</I>&gt;<i> this is the case.  That for the moment, we are all focusing on a 
</I>&gt;<i> product that can run on everyone's macheine without needing to be the 
</I>&gt;<i> only operating system running.  I do now see the advantages of this, 
</I>&gt;<i> but I would just like final clarity that this is the case.
