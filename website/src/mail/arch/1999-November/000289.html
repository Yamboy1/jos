<PRE>&gt;<i> 	I believe that it is counterproductive in this day and age to 
</I>&gt;<i> create an application or operating system that can only run on a 
</I>&gt;<i> handful of processor types, ie, x86 etc...
</I>
	The current VM for JOS runs on a very small kernel, at about 144 K
of C++ source (du -ac *.cc *.h in arch/i386/nativecode) and 33K of i386
ASM (du -ac *.asm), including both boot loaders.  The C++ source is
(AFAIK) standard ANSI code that should compile to any platform that g++
supports without change.  The ASM, obviously, will need to be changed, but
most of it is fairly simply stuff like preparing a flat address space and
passing interrupts (21K) to the C++ code.  (The most complicated bits are
extracting the location of the ramdisk from the booter, I think, but I
didn't right so I couldn't tell you for sure.)

	The reason to initially concentrate on the i386 is just that
they're dirt cheap (comparitively) and almost everyone has one.  Since
we've defined all our data types away from C already, I think portability
isn't going to be much of an issue which such a small kernel, but I could
be wrong.  Unfortunately, I don't have systems besides i386 with which to
test, nor do I know ASM for them...
