<PRE>&gt;<i> Misconceptions don't go away by themselves. It requires a great deal of
</I>&gt;<i> discussion to put a misconception to rest. The architecture mailing list is
</I>&gt;<i> a forum for discussing the possible architecture of JOS. Cutting short a
</I>&gt;<i> discussion about alternative architectures isn't helpful.
</I>
	This issue has been discussed in both the architecture and the
kernel list before.  Certain things that are absolutely necessary to
what you refer to as 'Ultimate JOS' require our own JVM, one with the
necessary hardware accesses.  The jJOS kernel on which the decaf JVM runs
is simple enough that a close approximation of it is already running on
Linux -- sans h/w access.  If someone more skilled in Linux kernel hackery
than I were willing to provide the necessary kernel mods to allow the host
build of jJOS to access the hardware, I would have no objection -- and it
would probably be very helpful for debugging until JOS is into the
bootstrap phase. (Likewise Bochs or VMWare, neither of which I've been
able to try.)
	I do not object to writing JOS in parallel; but when you say 'JOS
does not require a native kernel' and I read (your phrasing) 'Ultimate
JOS' -- well, that statement is a dangerous misconception, one that will
lead to the crippling of the JOS platform.  I think we agree with each
other more than we initially realised.  I am in favor of parallel
development -- the more the merrier.  However, I will not advocate the
development of emulators of the JOS kernel/VM, because I feel very
strongly that the efforts of programmers suited to this type of work would
be better spent on implementing those featurs on the JOS kernel/VM --
which right now appears to be jJOS and decaf.  This may end up being
sheerest optimism; I could be dramatically underestimating the gestation
time for jJOS/decaf.

	I think we both have only the highest of hopes for JOS; and
(forward referencing other mail in my inbox) that a distribution groups is
Good Idea.  I had been looking forward and seeing a disaster when
jJOS/decaf was ready for 'general consumption' and I had to put together
what amounts to the vast majority of the OS code -- so this puts my mind
much at ease.

	Your point that a 'transitional JOS' (though it's not an
operating system by many definitions) not needing its own
kernel/JVM is a good one; you say,

&gt;<i> You're talking about the future. I'm talking about the present.
</I>
	and you're quite correct.  My most major concern -- and it seems I
over-reacted -- is that you don't shortchange the future for the present.

&gt;<i> JOS cannot live up to its potential if you eliminate every consumer
</I>&gt;<i> that wants to benefit from their investment in their native OS.
</I>
	What is the investment that consumers make in their operating
systems?  I see two major sections: time investment in training and
familiarity and investment in software.  Time investment in training can
be addressed with work-alikes, to a certain extent, but if JOS is better,
it's going to be different, and we shouldn't worry about it too much --
aside from keeping the learning curve low in general.  Investment in
software there's just not anything we can do about; software running on X
native system isn't going to work on JOS, unless it's already Java.  (That
is, one primary goal of the JOS VM is to run extant Java bytecode w/o
modification.)

&gt;<i> The Transitional JOS runs Java applications just like Ultimate JOS.
</I>
	Okay, here's the problem: my contention is that the 'Transitional
JOS' can not run some of the applications which will comprise the
'Ultimate JOS'.  The question here is if the applications which provide
the maximal benefit to the user -- the ones we want to write -- can be
written without those sub-applications (libraries/APIs/etc).

	I suppose I should step back here.  I am not writing the
components of the 'Ultimate JOS' that you and others on the architecture
list are; I can't truly tell you about what is and is not possible with
respect to any particular application you're developing.  (continued
below)

&gt;<i> Java is worthwhile. It provides an excellent architecture for
</I>&gt;<i> platform-independence. You can run the same application on NT as you run on
</I>&gt;<i> a Mac or Linux.
</I>
&gt;<i> JOS is self-contained. JOS is extendable, network-aware and portable.
</I>&gt;<i> Unlike Java, JOS provides the greatest level of backward compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> and future orientation. It provides all of the OS-related things that
</I>&gt;<i> are missing from the Java class libraries.
</I>
	What you seem to be saying here is that the upper edge of JOS --
the applications/libraries/APIs which compose its interface -- can be
completely separated from their implementation; that the 'Ultimate JOS'
would be this upper edge running on an implementation that best supports
it, and applies its precepts to the management of the hardware.  My
concern is to the realization of this dream, that this upper edge is not
restricted by the restrictions imposed by a 'non-Ultimate' lower edge.

&gt;<i> We can learn from Lotus' experience. We should offer full featured,
</I>&gt;<i> comparable applications that run on JOS, both Transitional JOS and
</I>&gt;<i> Ultimate JOS.
</I>
	The same question crops up here.  Can applications that are as
good or better than the competition be written without the aid of the
'Ultimate JOS'?

&gt;<i> While you might feel strongly that Utlimate JOS is the best operating
</I>&gt;<i> system ever created (and I would agree), consumers must deal with issues of
</I>&gt;<i> here and now. They already bought a native OS. Why should they learn
</I>&gt;<i> another one?
</I>
	Because JOS /and its applications/ will be better.  That's all we
can offer -- see my question above.  The best thing to do at this point
might just be to try.  If a JOS application won't work without our own
JVM (which, in turn, will almost certainly work best on our own kernel),
or will work better with support from the JVM, then the debate is pretty
much settled, no?  The hard part is not to be trapped by the mindset a
devloper might develop from working on a lesser system.  (That is, the why
should I bother to make my app any more stable than the system on which it
runs? mentality applies to innovation as well, I think -- if it's harder
to get something innovative to work, it's less likely to get done...)

&gt;<i> JOS is Microsoft's worst nightmare come true. Microsoft hopes that we don't
</I>&gt;<i> figure out how to make JOS run on Windows. Once JOS runs on top of Windows,
</I>&gt;<i> consumers can run Windows and JOS. Consumers will have the best of both
</I>&gt;<i> worlds.
</I>
	Microsoft killed Netscape because they promised the same thing.
Luckily, we don't have a revenue stream to attack :)


	I pretty much have to trust your (JOS application programmers)
judgment about the portability of JOS APIs, but applications are not the
only thing make an O/S worthwhile.  As we've agreed, there are issues
about running 'Transitional JOS' -- even one that's a full peer of the
'Ultimate JOS' on the user (top-edge) side -- on a system which wasn't
designed to support it.
	However, JOS should also provide things like uniform models for
the various facets of multimedia, resource location and allocation,
hardware awareness -- all things that will need massive amounts of
platform-specific code to support.  jJOS and decaf form a kernel/JVM pair
written from the ground up to support things like this, and I think,
despite the value of writing applications for conventional JVMs (i.e.
those on other platforms), that this type of work would be better used on
the jJOS/decaf itself.
