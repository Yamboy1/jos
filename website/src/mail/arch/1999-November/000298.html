We must do better. We must not do what has already been done.

While building a new operating system is possible, it isn't easy. While
others have finished their operating systems, we have something they don't
have. We benefit from their experience. We know where they went wrong. We
do not have to make the same mistakes.

Historically, it makes sense to permanently disconnect the operating system
and its browser/shell/desktop. Many people have tried. Java technology is
the first time that the industry embraced the idea.

You must disconnect the operating system, its kernel, drivers and system
tools, from the browser/shell/desktop. When you do, you find that you have
an architecture where the JOS browser/shell/desktop will run on any native
OS. You can develop the browser/shell/desktop separately, to build a better
desktop and interactive computing environment.

You can build standard replacements for classic system tools. A JOS
Registry Editor can edit the Windows Registry. A JOS Registry editor can
edit the .conf, .ini and .properties files. You can replace the password
command on any operating system. You can replace the e-mail, web browser,
HTTP server, and all other components on a native OS over time.

While the JOSystem can be &quot;faked&quot; to debug this application, it make sense
to &quot;fake&quot; it permanently. If JOSystem will run on Linux, Mac, Windows,
OS/400, why not run it anywhere?

JOSystem can provide the classic HTTP cache for all applications, not just
an HTML browser. JOSystem can provide a cache on any native OS, not just
Ultimate JOS.

It is better than PCAnywhere. Using distributed processing, you can have a
desktop/shell/browser for each machine on the network. You can run the JOS
desktop on your &quot;other&quot; operating system to use the resources of JOS
servers on the network.

In the single console/multiple processor architecture, you need a better
OS. JOS is it. JOS does not require you to throw out all the software you
already use. Microsoft asks their customers to do this every year. Many
consumers are tired of spending money on software and having nothing to
show for it. Giving away software for free doesn't solve the problem if the
free software is obsolete after two years, too.

While we might wish that everyone on the planet would switch to Ultimate
JOS, it just isn't going to happen. There is competition. There are lots of
legacy applications that won't run on JOS -- and never will.

What is feasible and what is realistic is bringing relief to everyone who
suffers the complexity and the instability of other operating systems
through the power of a Java runtime environment and well designed, reliable
JOS subsystems.

Where are all the device drivers for Ultimate JOS? What is an operating
system without device drivers? Some people prefer an operating system that
works with the hardware they already bought. Some people prefer to buy
hardware and operating system together in the hope that it will work.

Compaq, Dell, Gateway, IBM and Toshiba might be willing to distribute
Transitional JOS on their machines if it runs on Windows 2000. Their
customers might be willing to install Transitional JOS on their machines if
it runs on their native OS.

You must find a way for your customers to take JOS for a test drive. Please
don't ask people to leap from one OS to another. Why not let them evolve?
They can take baby steps from their native OS to JOS if JOS runs on their
native OS. If they like Transitional JOS, they will love Ultimate JOS.
Plus, we can make Ultimate JOS even better by working all of the design
flaws out of Transitional JOS.

The path is clear and easy:

Part 1. From native OS to Transitional JOS
Part 2. From Transitional JOS to Ultimate JOS

Get your feet wet. Some people like to dive into their new OS and immerse
themselves in a new environment. They don't look back -- even for the
things they are missing.

Other people like to test the water first. They want to take their new OS
for a test drive. That is how Java itself was such a sensation. Customers
did not have to throw away anything in order to benefit from Java.

We can learn from the Java experience. We must provide transition. We must
do what Sun didn't: provide perfect backward compatibility. In order to
achieve a stable and high quality operating system, we must have a solid
foundation. Historically, the most successful operating systems have

1. provided a transitional phase from past to future.
  See also CP/M vs. MS-DOS
  See also AS/400 vs. System/36.
  See also Windows 95 vs. Windows 98.

2. maintained highest levels of backward compatibility.
  See also Win32 API.
  See also UNIX/Linux binary compatibility.

The least successful operating systems have the same problems:

1. no easy transition
  See also MS-DOS vs Windows 3.1.
  See also Windows 3.1 vs. OS/2
  See also Novell 3.x vs. Novell 4.x
  See also Windows 95 vs. Windows NT.
  See also Java 1 vs. Java 2.

The Windows 95 desktop should have been sold as a separate product. That
way, I could have installed the Windows 95 desktop on my Windows NT 3.1
operating system with no problem. I would have even installed it on OS/2.

The OS/2 desktop should have been sold separately. That way, I could have
installed the Windows 95 desktop on my Windows 95 operating system.

The benefits are clear when you install more than one desktop on your Linux
box. I can use both Windows 95 desktop and KDE and others. It is not a
kludge to run the JOS browser/shell/desktop on Windows 95. Technically, you
can switch between it and the standard desktop, like you switch desktops on
Linux.

Don't make people pay a high price in order to run the JOSystem. It is too
high of a price to insist that they stop running all of their legacy
applications. Why install a new OS and go out of business because your
legacy applications won't run anymore? That is what people do when
Microsoft asks them to install Windows 98 (or 2000). But it is wrong.

Why should the give up their legacy applications when they don't have to?
