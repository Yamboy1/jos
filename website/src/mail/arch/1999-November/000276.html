1. Do you have a copy of JOS?

have all of the pieces?

If you have taken the time to create your own collection of JOS, you could
help out others by helping us put together a JOS distribution. You should
be part of the distribution group, too.

I want to take JOS for a test drive. I had to download parts from CVS,
parts from Source Server, parts from various websites across the Internet.
It took me over eight months to gather parts of JOS. I know that I do not
have a full copy of JOS. There are critical pieces missing from my own
collection.

Missing: Pizza Compiler - I cannot find a copy of the Pizza Compiler. My
URL for its website must be out-of-date. Without it, I cannot compile
FreeBuilder for JOS.

The question of timing is important. We should determine the right time to
form a special interest group.

In addition to timing, the basic questions are these:

1. Will the JOS Project ever need such a group?

2. Can we function without it?

3. What kind of problems will a distribution group solve?

4. Will such a group get in the way?

5. Who will contribute to the distribution group?

6. How much power and authority should such a group have? (Who should they
answer to?)

&gt;<i>Since there is no kernel that is fully implemented. Also, until right now,
</I>&gt;<i>there is only a few people are still actively working on JOS. So, Let wait
</I>&gt;<i>for one kernel that's fully runnable.
</I>
There is far more to the JOS Project than a kernel. There are products
available today that are fully implemented and can be distributed.

1. The distribution group should work hard to make everyone is aware of
these other products. They can be collected together, described and
reviewed on behalf of the community.

2. The distribution group should help us show how many people are working
on JOS. You might be surprised to find out that quite a few people are (1)
actively working on JOS and (2) far more people are keenly interested in
using JOS.

It is an important function of the distribution group to show how times the
distribution has been downloaded. For example, the JJOS module has been
downloaded 240+ times in October from the JOS 1d Technical Distribution.

Plus, such a distribution group might solicite others to put up mirror
sites for JOS. Why? Because as soon as a JOS kernel is available, I believe
there will be thousands of people who will want to take it for a test drive.

I believe in being prepared. The distribution group sounds like one of the
best ways I can think of to prepare the JOS Project for the next level.

I have reason to believe the JOS Project needs a distribution group and has
needed it for quite some time. The demand for JOS distribution has not been
met by CVS or Source Server. CVS is too complex for only trying to take JOS
for a test drive. (The Internet tradition is to offer a .tar.gz and .zip
test drive with zero complexity.) The Source Server might have helped but
it is fatally broken. (It doesn't get the job done.)

If the distribution group is not needed already, it might be needed soon.
Why wait?
