Clarity is important and difficult. Clarity is important so that everybody
knows full well what it is we are working on. Clarity is difficult because
so many people are using a traditional operating system as their point of
reference.

Sure, JOS is like Linux. Like Linux is a stable operating system, written
in a little assembler and C/C++ and does not have any dependency on another
operating system. JOS is more like Linux than a Java runtime environment.

Look at the difference between Linux and a Java runtime environment. A Java
runtime environment depends on another operating system, somewhere in the
mix to provide the kernel and device drivers, security, processes,
services, TCP/PI stack, and more. JOS is less like a Java runtime
environment, and more like a full operating system. This is JOS, the
Java-based operating system.

But JOS is not Linux (is it?). JOS does not serve up the Linux platform API
(does it?). JOS does not use the Linux mechanism for shared libraries (does
it?). If your thinking about JOS as if it is just another operating system
-- forget it. You must stop and think about the assumptions you have picked
up through your experience with all these other operating systems.

JOS is a pioneer of the next generation of operating systems. There is
nothing like it on the IBM PC. It has never been done before (well, not
exactly).

Architecture-wise, JOS is actually more like OS/400. OS/400 has a
well-defined &quot;machine interface&quot; just as JOS has a JOSBox. Through this
abstraction, a very large portion (over 80%) of OS/400 is identical for
every AS/400 processor. The AS/400 is a series of minicomputer/mainframe
computers from IBM. The small AS/400 runs on a microprossor. It's
instruction set is incompatible with its older bigger brothers.

But with the help of a well-defined machine interface, IBM has been able to
run one implementation of OS/400 on many different kinds of machines. Part
of this was by design; part was out of sheer desparation. Imagine having
30+ operating systems to maintain, one for each machine. That's what IBM
was doing before creating this machine interface, an abstract machine.

The kernel group is working on a JOS kernel and a JVM that runs on the JOS
kernel. The kernel group is using Sun Microsystems' implementation of the
Java class libraries (aren't they?). They are compiling the JOS kernel
using Linux. JOS cannot be compiled on JOS. They are developing a JVM on
Linux and testing it on JOS.

But, just as the decaf JVM runs on Linux, any JVM can be turned into a
classic JVM in the style and precedent set by Sun Microsystems and their
JDK. The JVM is separate and distinct from its kernel. Like the machine
interface of OS/400, the JVM can run on many different kernels. While some
like this idea, other members of the JOS project see how it would cripple
the performance of the platform. And yet, the decaf JVM needs to run on
Linux so that we have some hope of debugging it within our lifetime.

If we have another operating system available to us, why not use it? It can
only help us refine JOS more quickly. For more information on using a
&quot;foreign&quot; operating system to develop a new one, see also &quot;Soul of a New
Machine&quot; by Tracy Kidder.

The JOS Project works on many different things at the same time. The
discussion on the architecture group is discussion about what is possible.
Meanwhile, the kernel group is actual building a kernel and JVM.

It is our working assumption that the classpath project will provide a
clone of the Java class libraries (isn't it?). These will plug into the
decaf JVM without too much trouble (won't they?).

It is also our assumption that an operating system is more than a kernel
and JVM. There are a lot of subsystems and services that must be built in
order for JOS to do work. It is our assumption (isn't it) that most of
these will be built from bytecode, compiled by an unmodified javac tool.
Here are a few subsystems and services that come to mind.

 - device subsystem
 - file subsystem
 - security subsystem
 - window manager
 - syslogd
 - tftpd
 - bootpd
 - telnetd
 - ftpd
 - httpd
 - inetd

In order to debug and demonstrate, develop and test the bytecode that goes
into these systems, JOS is more like a Virtual OS. Parallel development
means that we can build bytecode now. We do not have to wait for the kernel
or JVM to be completely finished and perfected.

You can download a javac tool. You can purchase a javac tool. And javac
tool will do; you do not have to wait for the JOS javac tool to compile
bytecode for the JOS project.

Like you, I am struggling to understand what the JOS Project is going to do
with such a historically significant idea. Odds are against us. We're the
underdog. Many people think that Microsoft is going to figure out the next
generation operating system and JOS will be a moot point. I don't think so.
I have invested a lot of time and energy in JOS because it has great
potential, both now and into the future.

This is my first and only open-source project. This is my first Internet
mailing list. I don't have any say-so in how the jJOS kernel or decaf JVM
will be distributed. That's not what I'm working on.

If you want to know how the two project shall meet, here is a pretty good
estimate. The jJOS kernel and decaf is capable of running the init.class
(isn't it?). Imagine that we had a release that implemented the Java 2
Platform perfectly. Every opcode has been tested and it works. Every
mechanism, including Java Native Interface, has been finished. What then?

The init.class isn't much to look at. The init.class, once in bytecode, is
going to need to go somewhere useful. It needs to start the JADE
application; but JADE isn't finished yet. It needs to start a syslogd
service; but syslogd hasn't been written yet. It needs to start telnetd;
but that's not finished.

I might not want to play pong on my JOS machine. I want to start a telnet
program on my JOS machine and watch as it connects to my Linux server. That
would be something useful. In turn, I want to start telnet on my Linux
server and watch as it connects to my JOS machine. That would be a
milestone we could all celebrate (wouldn't it?). 

I would like to help the JOS project succeed. We need volunteers to make it
happen. I sincerely regret scaring volunteers away from the JOS project. We
can use all of the help we can get.
