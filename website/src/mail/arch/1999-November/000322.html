&gt;<i>can you tell me something about the JOS packages ?
</I>
You're right. You bring up an important issue. It is reasonable for someone
to expect to learn something about a JOS package *before* they download it.
Information about JOS packages is found on JOS Wiki, inside the source
code, inside documentation inside a distribution, inside a variety of
mailing lists, and on other Internet websites. Some packages have no synopsis.

My first goal is to identify each JOS package. Have I been able to find all
of them? I don't think so. It is important for members to know that a
package exists.

So far, package descriptions have happened naturally. The author puts a
description inside the package distribution, either in source code, a
README file or index.html file.

On one hand, we might insist the author of a package to provide a
description of it. When an author is developing a package, they are busy
getting the package to work correctly.

Anyone, who might like to volunteer, can look inside a package and write a
brief review for the benefit of the author and other members of the JOS
Project. Where we publish these reviews? It might be a good thing to
publish many descriptions on a single page in JOS Wiki. While there are too
many descriptions to fit all of them on one page, the package descriptions
could be organized by product. A package cross-reference, in alphabetical
order by package name, should explain which product a package &quot;belongs to&quot;.

&gt;<i>I mean, is there any web page which describes each of the JOS packages listed
</I>&gt;<i>by Gilbert in <A HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~gchii/jos/library/packages.html">http://www.mindspring.com/~gchii/jos/library/packages.html</A> ?
</I>&gt;<i>Excluding source server, is it possible to download the other packages ?
</I>
Packages are found in a variety of places, and should be. The JOS 1d
Technical Distribution was an effort to provide one-stop-shopping for as
many packages as I could find. Since I collected all these packages into
one place, I figured I could save other members of the JOS Project the
hassle of collecting them one at a time.

The JOS 1d Technical Distribution is a snapshot of the JOS Project
packages. All of the files were downloaded within October 1999. It was not
an attempt to fix problems; it just shows you what's available.

&gt;<i>What's the meaning of &quot;pizza status&quot; ?
</I>
The Pizza compiler used to have an Internet website; but, it seems to have
gone &quot;off the air&quot;. I have been unable to find the pizza packages. As
written, FreeBuilder for JOS depends on them as you use the javac tool.
Packages marked with the &quot;pizza&quot; status won't compile without them.

&gt;<i>Does it mean that to compile the package I need the pizza compiler ?
</I>
The Pizza compiler is used by FreeBuilder. It is not required to compile
FreeBuilder or any other JOS product.

&gt;<i>But why I cannot use the &quot;standard&quot; javac ?
</I>
Yes, you should use the standard javac or whatever IDE you prefer.

&gt;<i>Really, I have tried to compile the source server package with javac, but
</I>&gt;<i>I get a long list of errors. Some of them are syntax errors, thus they are
</I>&gt;<i>not related to the type of compiler used.
</I>
Let's think about this. It is going to take coordinated effort to get all
that code free from syntax errors, pre-compiled and pre-jar'd. Ever since
it has been unable to upload new code, it has been unable to upload fixes
to the syntax errors created by Source Server's pretty printer. When the
source server mangles some of the source code, it mangles it for everyone.
We should not ask individual members of the JOS Project to fix these errors.

I have updated my package cross-reference to show individual classes from
Source Server that I haven't been able to compile yet. Within each package
with a &quot;tool&quot; status, I have listed each source file that needs attention,
something like this:

  Out-Of-Date Classes:
  1. &lt;class-name&gt;.java

If you can send me (1) a corrected .java file and/or (2) a pre-compiled
.class file for any of these classe, I will redistributed them to members
of the JOS Project.

Here is my distribution proposal for immediate discussion. The distribution
group should mobilize quickly to create a syntax-error-free distribution of
source code from Source Server code. Not only should we fix the syntax
errors from Source Server and redistribute syntax-error-free source code,
we should also create a binary distribution of the Source Server product.

I propose that members of the JOS Project switch from Source Server to
&quot;normal&quot; distribution of archives (.tgz and .zip). In other words, take the
content of Source Server -- exactly as it is mangled -- and redistribute it
as jos1d-srcserv-#.zip.

We can skip distribution 1. Distribution 1 is not an archive-based
distribution. It is the distribution that came from Source Server rather
than an archive. I downloaded all files from Source Server around October
1st, 1999. I don't think anything could have changed since then.

Personally, I have already &quot;fixed&quot; 70+ syntax errors since October. Here is
what I should do: I should finish jos1d-srcserv.jar and
jos1d-srcserv-src.zip today. These archives contains my 70+ fixes and as
many classes as I could compile with my tools. I have neither
javax.infobus.* nor javax.swing.*, for example.

I have excluded java.* packages from the binary distribution of the Source
Server product. They won't work on an existing JVM. Are any other pieces
are missing (?).

Keep checking the JOSDistribution1d page for a new Source Server archive.
For those members of the JOS Project that have already downloaded source
code from Source Server, you should download jos1d-srcserv-2-src.zip and
validate its contents.

Otherwise, download jos1d-srcserv-2.zip for the .class files.

So far, JOS 1d Technical Distribution has not qualified what should or
should not be redistributed. It is something like garbage in, garbage out.
The JOS 1e Technical Distribution might be a little more focused and less
experimental.

&gt;<i>So, can you tell me something else about the status of the packages (e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i>written but not compiled, successfully compiled but not runned, successfully
</I>&gt;<i>runned) ?
</I>
The &quot;unknown&quot; status is meant to be &quot;written, but not compiled&quot;.

The &quot;compiled&quot; status is meant to be &quot;compiled, but not yet archived&quot;.

The &quot;archived&quot; status is meant to be &quot;compiled and archived, but not yet
distributed&quot;.

The &quot;distributed&quot; status is meant to be &quot;distributed&quot;, available across the
Internet for immediate download.

As far as running this stuff, you're on your own. Distribution gets it to
you. What you do with it after that is another issue.
