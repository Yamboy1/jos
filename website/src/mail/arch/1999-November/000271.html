<PRE>Personally, the distribution group is important to me. I would like to take
a moment to explain why.

It was only by accident that I discovered a need for a distribution group.
In my own goal to take JOS for a test drive, I discovered that it is
difficult to collect all of the pieces to get JOS up and running. It
doesn't have to be that way.

I just want to run it. Running Java-based utilities and applications is
exciting. I want to see what JOS might look like. I want to help build a
binary distribution of JOS so that other people can download and run it. I
want other people to see what JOS might look like, too.

As far as open source goes, I want reassurances that I could read the
source code for everything if I want to. I only want to compile the little
bit of source code that I absolutely have to in order to get it to work on
my computer.

Compiling Java code isn't my kind of fun. I would like to download
Java-related parts of JOS and run it on my computer. I do not want to
compile it, debug it or develop it.

I have been working on a technique to create a binary distribution of JOS.
It organizes a collection of closely related Java packages into a
&quot;product&quot;. Each &quot;product&quot; is maintained (and distributed) independently.

For example, all of the packages closely related to &quot;Smart API - Release
1a&quot; should be maintained together in a &quot;smartapi1a&quot; collection. From a
small collection of packages, a version is distributed with or without
source code.

The following information illustrates how to distribute a JOS product,
using the Smart API - Release 1a as an example.

smartapi1a-1.1.jar
A typical end-user doesn't need to rebuild the smartapi1a-1.1.jar. This
distributable archive contains a copy of all class files for the smartapi1a
collection, manifest, README and JOS-LICENSE. Everything is pre-compiled.
This is not a programmer's edition. A jar file is &quot;installed&quot; on a machine
after it is made.

smartapi1a-1.1-sx.zip
A typical programmer doesn't need to rebuild the smartapi1a-1.1.jar. But
he/she must understand how to use it to build Java programs. This
distributable archive contains source code and only source code for the
smartapi1a.jar file. It does not contain smartapi1a-1.1.jar. The source
code is stored in src.zip. This is a programmer's edition. A programmer can
write Java programs that use the classes in smartapi1a-1.1.jar. A
programmer might create JavaDoc from the source code. A programmer might
format the source code to HTML with a pretty printer.

smartapi1a-1.1-tx.zip
Members of the JOS Project and others will contribute source code to the
collection. This distributable archive contains the make files, tools,
utilities, and instructions on how to customize and build a substitute for
the smartapi1a-1.1.jar.

/smartapi1a-1.1/src directory
This directory contains a copy of source code to build class files. This
directory is distributed as src.zip inside smartapi1a-1.1-sx.zip.

/smartapi1a-1.1/classes directory
This directory contains class files. This directory is distributed as
smartapi1a-1.1.jar.

/smartapi1a-1.1/make file
This make script should make all of the class files from source _and_
create a new smartapi1a-1.1.jar from class files. An &quot;install&quot; define
should install a jar in a JRE/lib directory.
