<PRE>&gt;<i> My recommendation is this: We need to form a distribution group. It should
</I>&gt;<i> be a special interest group under architecture (continuing to use the
</I>&gt;<i> architecture mailing list).
</I>
This sounds like a good idea.

&gt;<i> Should we drop FreeBuilder for JOS? When FreeBuilder for Java will run
</I>&gt;<i> unchanged on JOS, does there need to be a JOS-specific release?
</I>
No.  IMHO, this should be a high priority.  If we can have a special 
edition of FreeBuilder designed especially for JOS it will have 
properties that are not needed in a general purpose FreeBuilder for 
general Java.  These include support for JOS &quot;native&quot; classes 
(things under jos.*), hopefully, enough of a C/C++/assembly 
compiler to build ALL of JOS, and debugger support for the JOS 
specific debugging interfaces we'll have to design into the kernel, 
JOSBox, etc that aren't normal java.

Ideally, people can use FreeBuilder to build all of JOS and its add 
on utilities/apps.  I think that while our present strategy of using 
GNU tools on Linux is a good stop-gap measure, JOS won't really 
be on its own without all its build tools being Java (i.e. I don't run 
Linux anywhere convenient for my using it to develop so I'm &quot;out of 
the loop&quot; as far as being able to contribute to kernel development.  
If we used java C/C++ compilers/assemblers, I could also help out 
on my Win32 box).

&gt;<i> In order to make the JOS worthwhile as an open source project, all its code
</I>&gt;<i> must be compile-able on other programmer's machines. We should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrate frequently how easy it is to download and recompile the whole
</I>&gt;<i> collection of source code.
</I>
This may be something that will naturally occur when we actually 
have a working distribution.  I mean, someone will have to re-
organize and build everything for a distribution... :)  But I agree, 
organizing it sooner rather than later is a good idea.

&gt;<i> Many people would prefer a binary distribution. I am working toward
</I>&gt;<i> building a binary distribution to prove that the Java source code can be
</I>&gt;<i> compiled and used in working Java programs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What will it take to reach this goal?
</I>
Probably a lot.  As is true in any big opensource project, its hard to 
pin people to being &quot;points of contact&quot; for all packages.  So you 
really need someone with the personality that they will build what 
they find, and if they can't find a good point of contact, will assume 
responsibility for at least getting it to build.  In addition, since we're 
in a pretty unique position with the crossplatform Java bytecode as 
our binary standard, we can actually, legitimately break our 
distribution into:

JOS - the os and tightly integrated utilities
JAVA - apps and everything else that runs in java and can be used 
on any java platform.

Now, the JOS distribution is not ready.  But we should be able to 
put together some distribution which is basically the JAVA part as 
one big installable set of apps/utils.  This would be good to create 
separately because it would allow us to work on fundamental 
issues we'll have to face later anyhow.  Such as how to actually 
distribute our code/binaries.  An installer/uninstaller system.  A 
registry or similar method of keeping track of software (and 
management tools for such).  How to handle the class versioning 
problem (I think if we can address this problem alone, its worth the 
price of admission!).  A more elegant system of launching and 
configuring programs (the whole classpath/policy files problems 
that constanly crop up when getting java programs used is just 
unacceptable... but a &quot;replacement&quot; system will have to be smart 
to work on regular java systems... Maybe a custom classloader?).

Anyhow, its a lot of work, but there's very interesting and 
challenging issues to address so its not all grunt labor.  Just my 
opinion of course.
