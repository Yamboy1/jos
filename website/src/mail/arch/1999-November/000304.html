&quot;A kernel does not an operating system make,&quot;

I (Iain) said that.  It was intended to be said with a Yoda (Star 
Wars) accent.  :)  I agree that the focus seems to be very lopsided 
on the kernel.  I see several JOSystem problems that working 
groups IMHO should be attacking now.  They will be useful with or 
without the rest of the JOS system and will help all java 
installations.  And they can be developed on any jdk available now.

1) a standardized install/uninstall api for java applications.  ala 
Installshield on Win32 and sorta RPM on linux.  The installs should 
actually target classfile -&gt; logical_location mappings so each 
platform can map the logical_location to appropriate filesystem, 
classpath, registry, database or whatever mechanisms to store the 
the classfile and enable loading of the class path.

2) shared library manager.  Basically a way to avoid the DLL hell 
that plagues Win32.  That is, a platform neutral way to load the 
correct classes with the correct programs taking into account 
versions of libraries, etc.  Such a system may require a rewrite of 
the classloader.  Ideally, new versions of shared code will 
_supplement_ and not replace older versions.  Applications will 
attempt operation using the new version (to gain enhancements) 
but failures will cause them to automatically revert to using the 
older (known good) version.

3) package manager/launcher - a method to specify and group 
classfiles together logically without having to do so physically (jar 
them) for managament and application launching.  This gives users 
a view of packages as &quot;single exe&quot; looking entities.  This is cleaner 
and what I image was intended with &quot;executable jars&quot; but allows us 
to continue to share code (and eliminate redundant copies of 
classes).

&gt;<i> Give people what they want. Most people are curious about JOS. They want to
</I>&gt;<i> take it for a test drive. They don't care how fast it is. They just want to
</I>&gt;<i> see what it might be like, comparing it to the OS they already have.
</I>
This I think is actually most dependent on the UI group actually 
generating a desktop.  Watching printf debug messages crank gets 
really tiring and is certainly not very impressive!  I think just 
screenshots from a new UI would get more people more excited 
about JOS than probably even a shipping kernel with no GUI 
support.  And, the UI list has been ghostly silent recently.
