<PRE>A distribution group should be formed to help redistribute all of the
existing components of the JOS Project to its members. A distribution group
will help identify and consistenly package existing components so that
members of the JOS Project will have no trouble at all getting their copy
of JOS.

If you would like to join the distribution group, please reply on the
architecture mailing list. Are you wondering if you should join? Ask your
questions here.

JOS needs to be redistributed to members of the JOS Project so that
everyone sees what JOS is today and the potential for what it might be
tomorrow. The distribution group should make recommendations to members of
the JOS Project as to repackaging their code to fit in to the org.jos
namespace.

The distribution group is a special interest group of the architecture
group. Architecture and distribution are closely related, in that, JOS
needs to be packaged to fully support its architecture.

The distribution group should manage the check list of product names and
where development tools can be downloaded or aquired.

The distribution group should be formed now. It will help promote the clear
perception of what is and what is not JOS. It will attempt to keep future
misconceptions to a minimum.

We must be capable of explaining JOS to members of the JOS Project. After
we have a reasonable perception of JOS among members, our public-relations
group should be take over to explain JOS to non-members.

Where can you help? If you know of any JOS-related distribution, you should
post it on this forum. If the distribution is already on a JOS Wiki page,
please indicate the name of the page.

Personally, I have only been a member for a short time. I don't know that I
have everything that has been developed for JOS. I know that I have been
unable to boot JOS from a floppy across my network. It shouldn't be this
difficult for people to download and install JOS, to take JOS for a test
drive.

Feel free to disagree with me. I think that a solid distribution group
might make it easier for every member of the JOS project to build a
distribution and make sure every other member is aware of their work.

The recommendations of the distribution group are not binding. As always,
members can do whatever they like. The distribution group might be able to
offer additional tools (in pure Java, of course) that make it easier and
easier to build a distribution and make it available to other members and
even non-members.

I have tried to use a long list of Java development tools. I must confess
that none of them come close to what I need to get my work done. I am using
many different tools, each tool does almost what I need. I have been
limping along like this for over five years. This is what I do not like
about my operating system: I cannot fix it. With Java and a Java-based
operating system, it will put me in control of my own machine. I will be
able to fix anything I don't like. If I can't get my work done, I will have
no excuses because it is all my responsibility.

I'm sure that my contribution to the JOS Project would have been higher
quality if I had JOS and its tools from the beginning. I can't wait to
develop more of JOS on JOS. Meanwhile, there is source code and bytecode
that needs to be distributed. How should it be done? What should it be called?

For example, I plan to distribute the Smart API and all of its related
classes as a single binary distribution in two equivalent files, called

   &quot;smartapi-1.tgz&quot; and 
   &quot;smartapi-1.zip&quot;.

I have been working on the Smart API from the ground up. Everything in this
distribution is functional. If it doesn't work yet, it isn't in the
distribution. If you would like to see what JOS might look like, you should
look at the architecture demonstrated by the Smart API.

It puts a consistent front end on many class libraries found in Java. It is
better than the multiple-stage factory of java.net.URL. While I have been
using the Smart API for a while, it has been difficult to distribute it to
members of the JOS Project. That has got to change.

You don't have to formally &quot;join&quot; the distribution group. You can
contribute to the discussion whenever you feel like it. If you feel
strongly about these issues, you should join and help us shape the
expectations of JOS distribution. We must be prepared for JOS distribution
long before Ultimate JOS is ready.

Based on this discussion, we might build &quot;DistributionGroup&quot; and related
pages on JOS Wiki.

How many JOS Project members would like to know if they have everything? A
distribution group might help build the mechanism to let members verify
that they have everything that is currently available. The hit and miss
documentation on JOS Wiki is adequate for special interest groups; but, it
doesn't serve the needs of the whole JOS Project. When I joined the JOS
Project, I wanted to make Extreme Distributed Computing (XDC) available to
its members. Even after all this time, XDC hasn't been discussed. Do you
have a copy? What can it do for JOS?

An XDC-based IPC is similar to an XML-based IPC. This kind of protocol has
been available for 10+ years, according to one company. While they call it
Dynanic Data Storage (DDS), I call it Dynamic Storage Objects (DSO). It is
the same thing that can be done with XML.

What process should we use to follow up on a JOS product distribution?
Should we review it? Should we &quot;vote&quot; on retaining it for JOS? Or rejecting
it?

How does it work now?
