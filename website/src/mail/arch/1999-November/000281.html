<PRE>Building the Smart API is just about the most ambitious project I have ever
completed. I have been complaining for over fifteen years about the complex
problems created by class libraries. It has only been within the last year
that I see where class libraries can be loosely coupled for programming in
the large. Compared to subroutine libraries and libraries with an
object-oriented wrapper, a genuine class library is a challenge for
backward compatibility and future orientation.

If you haven't noticed the potential of the Smart API yet, you should take
a moment to read the SmartAPIProtocols page on JOS Wiki.

It is hard to pin down my favorite example of the Smart API. I certainly
enjoyed the Connection Factory when writing Java servlets for an AS/400 and
DB/2. It came down to requesting a connection, like this:

URI uri = new URI( &quot;jdbc:<A HREF="db2://HOST/LIBRARY"">db2://HOST/LIBRARY&quot;</A> );
Connection c = (Connection) uri.getObject();

My application program did not configure any JDBC drivers. My application
program benefits from any future JDBC drivers configured for the Connection
Factory.

And recently, I wrote a program to copy source code on a package-by-package
basis. It was refreshing to output source code without explicitely creating
target directories:

URI uri = new URI( &quot;out:print:file:org/jos/demo/Demo.java&quot; );
PrintStream p = (PrintStream) uri.getObject();

Besides I have been using the Smart API to load all kinds of configuration
files as registry objects, like this:

URI uri = new URI( &quot;x-registry:ini:file:config&quot; );
Registry r = (Registry) uri.getObject();

Has anyone else been able to use the Smart API?

I have been using it in production systems for two of my ultra-conservative
corporate customers for a couple of months. They appreciate the benefits of
pre-compiled and pre-configured one-stop-shopping for all digital resources.

What will it take for an entire operating system to embrace the concepts of
loosely-coupled class libraries, uniform resource identifiers, backward
compatibilty and future orientation?

For Java, it means that well-known interfaces must be kept in packages free
from custom implementations. It also means that each release of an API must
have a unique part of the Java namespace.
