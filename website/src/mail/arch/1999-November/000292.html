<PRE>In response to Todd's post about how it would serve very little point 
to have Jos run inside of an existing operating system I have to 
agree.  I currently run Linux, Mac OS X, Mac OS 9, Mac OS 8.6, 
WinNTServer, and Solaris.  Of these OS's I would not be inclined to 
run JOS inside of any of them.  There would be little to no point.  I 
can run a JVM on them and use any native Java application.  So why 
would I intentionally slow down one of my machines just to run a 
bleeding edge pseudo OS that would give me no benefit.  I believe 
that a better option would be to attempt to write a base kernel that 
incorporated the JVM for each platform.  Then, write 100% native Java 
apps to run there.  Linux is having a profound impact on the personal 
computer industry as well as capturing a portion of the corporate 
market.  Why not give linux enthusiasts an alternative that would 
allow all apps to run under the same os.  I am not at all suggesting 
that we take the window manager out of their hands, but I do think 
that we should make this a native os and not focus on the seemingly 
pointless task of creating a virtual os.
	So the question becomes this:  How many of you would use a 
user interface that is going to slow down your machine and allow you 
to do nothing more that the existing JVM running on your particular 
platform can do?  I for one think that my machines run sluggish 
enough without the help of an added layer to impede my everyday tasks.
	If the view of this orginization is to create an pseudo OS to 
run inside of an existing OS, then I think that someone needs to 
create a native JOS.  The framework is not as difficult as one would 
think, although it is beyond my basic skill level.  If we could 
incorporate the JVM into the kernel, and supply a different kernel 
for each processor architecture then applications and window managers 
could be created in pure java eliminating the need for a runtime 
environment inside of an existing OS.
