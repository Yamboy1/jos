<PRE>I've started a discussion on this under Wiki JOSArchitectureDiscussion, to
have a better visual area for discussion.  Of course, we can always further
the discussion here.

Like, what I do below :-)

&gt;<i> The JOSBox is the computer were writing this OS for, in a sense. It is the
</I>virtual hardware the JOSystem &quot;kernel&quot; is running on, if someone made this
into real hardware a modified JOSystem would run JOS on it directly. It is
the true kernel and the JVM. A JOSBox application could be made sans kernel,
this is how you could run JOS on a non-JOS machine; the JOSystem would
require extra features the JOSBox supplies to run so just running it on &quot;any
old VM&quot; would be painful, a special JOSBox would be the way to go. The main
benifit of this I see is not in having a showcase for JOS but in having a
multi-process java environment running on ones computer, allowing (with
minor modification) to let the OS &quot;launch&quot; Java apps into this
environment/quasiOS cutting down on memory and start time (people would get
to tour JOS then get to keep a powerful tool like that). I think we should
get a kernel/VM JOSBox up then modify it to be an &quot;emulator&quot; JOSBox later
on, just my opinion though.

This quickly brings to my mind the question: so the APIs that are in charge
of letting Java code interact with &quot;virtual hardware&quot; in JOSBox or JOSystem,
or is this just a symantic argument?

The drivers and devices in JOSExtentions need to be able to be JOSBox
dependent, i.e. a Mac JOSBox will have different low-level drivers than a
TRS-80 JOSBox. However, hopefully we can make our drivers above this
low-level compatible across the system, such as File System and RAM Disk,
and hence put these drivers truly under the JOSExtentions category. So do
these box-dependent drivers actually belong in JOSBox, not the extentions?

I wouldn't like to think so.  Since the JOSBox is intended to be absolutely
minimal, my TRS-80 won't need low-level network drivers, but my Crey will.
Perhaps a JOSBoxExtentions package to cover this category?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> JVM incompatabilities might be solved with the exokernel design. Exokernel
</I>is basically a blank slate of a kernel that allows libraries to be plugged
into it to provide optimal hardware use (and, of course, having a default
library for legacy apps). Whats this have to do with JVM's!? Good question,
say we have most of the stuff that makes a JVM and then have little
libraries filling the rest in, in a release compatiable manner. That is, we
have XVM (exo-VM) with a JDK 1.0 library, a 1.1 lib and a 1.2 lib. I don't
know how well that would work, but its worth a thought.

This may be pushing a moot point, but the way I read it was Exokernels put
the kernel into extention packages. This way, the HttpServer package can
optimize its networking pipeline, which may be different from the
MediaServer's networking pipeline.  It puts all the weight of the kernel
APIs into the dynamically loadable executable.  But perhaps this /is/ what
you are refering to...
