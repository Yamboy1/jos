It is a good idea for each organization that builds an operating system to
incorporate kernel support for Java. I know for sure the people who make
Linux and OS/400 have done this. I'm not sure about others.

It is not for the JOS Project to rewrite the kernel of every other native
operating system.

&gt;<i>...I do think that we should make this a native os and not focus on the
</I>&gt;<i>seemingly pointless task of creating a virtual os.
</I>
The native kernel and system tools must come together in order to give
people something they can use. We must keep focus on both the native kernel
and its system tools. While the system tools require a JVM, the native
kernel does not.

Does an OS with a virtual machine make a virtual OS? I don't think so. It
is a better OS, easier to port from one processor to another.

&gt;<i>If the view of this orginization is to create an pseudo OS to
</I>&gt;<i>run inside of an existing OS, then I think that someone needs to 
</I>&gt;<i>create a native JOS.
</I>
The architecture group is supposed to hash out the architecture of JOS and
where the virtual machine ends and the system tools begin. Someone must
create a native JOS *and* someone must create the system tools.

&gt;<i>If we could incorporate the JVM into the kernel, and supply a different
</I>&gt;<i>kernel for each processor architecture then applications and window managers 
</I>&gt;<i>could be created in pure java eliminating the need for a runtime 
</I>&gt;<i>environment inside of an existing OS.
</I>
Here! Here! The JOS Project can port a different kernel for each processor
architecture. That is the non-Java part of JOS. The JOS Project can supply
system tools in pure Java. You'll notice that Red Hat and SuSE provides
some of their Linux system tools in pure Java. Sounds like a great idea.

As much of the operating system that can be written as Java bytecode should
be written as Java bytecode.

&gt;<i>How many of you would use a user interface that is going to slow down your
</I>&gt;<i>machine and allow you to do nothing...
</I>
How true. It is our long-term goal to build a better operating system.
Every person using Windows is in this situation. And yet, they put up with
it. People put up with it because there is no feasible alterative. There is
no easy transition from Windows to anything else.

Every person using Linux is also in this situation, where Linux is far more
complex that what a modern operating system needs to be.
