</I>&gt;<i> I want to take JOS for a test drive. I had to download parts from CVS,

</I>&gt;<i> It took me over eight months to gather parts of JOS. I know that I do not

</I>&gt;<i> collection.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Missing: Pizza Compiler - I cannot find a copy of the Pizza Compiler. My
</I>&gt;<i> URL for its website must be out-of-date. Without it, I cannot compile
</I>&gt;<i> FreeBuilder for JOS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Well, I don't think it is the right time to create a distribution group
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;for JOS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The question of timing is important. We should determine the right time to
</I>&gt;<i> form a special interest group.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In addition to timing, the basic questions are these:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Will the JOS Project ever need such a group?
</I>
I think so.
 
&gt;<i> 2. Can we function without it?
</I>
Short answer: yes; long answer: no. We can but it'll never make us popular with the masses.
 
&gt;<i> 3. What kind of problems will a distribution group solve?
</I>
Getting JOS to people who want it. It could also act as a quasimanagerial force (leader vs. ruler) helping the different projects and groups communicate.
 
&gt;<i> 4. Will such a group get in the way?
</I>
Potentially any group can get in the way, but we can always, simply, ignore them when and by that I mean if they do.
 
&gt;<i> 5. Who will contribute to the distribution group?
</I>
Whomever wants to.
 
&gt;<i> 6. How much power and authority should such a group have? (Who should they
</I>&gt;<i> answer to?)
</I>
I didn't know anyone &quot;answered&quot; to anyone...
 
&gt;<i> &gt;Since there is no kernel that is fully implemented. Also, until right now,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;there is only a few people are still actively working on JOS. So, Let wait
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;for one kernel that's fully runnable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is far more to the JOS Project than a kernel. There are products
</I>&gt;<i> available today that are fully implemented and can be distributed.
</I>
like Jext
 
&gt;<i> 1. The distribution group should work hard to make everyone is aware of
</I>&gt;<i> these other products. They can be collected together, described and
</I>&gt;<i> reviewed on behalf of the community.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The distribution group should help us show how many people are working
</I>&gt;<i> on JOS. You might be surprised to find out that quite a few people are (1)
</I>&gt;<i> actively working on JOS and (2) far more people are keenly interested in
</I>&gt;<i> using JOS.
</I>
They could also take suggestions from the interested public to us, the programmers.

&gt;<i> It is an important function of the distribution group to show how times the
</I>&gt;<i> distribution has been downloaded. For example, the JJOS module has been
</I>&gt;<i> downloaded 240+ times in October from the JOS 1d Technical Distribution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Plus, such a distribution group might solicite others to put up mirror
</I>&gt;<i> sites for JOS. Why? Because as soon as a JOS kernel is available, I believe
</I>&gt;<i> there will be thousands of people who will want to take it for a test drive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe in being prepared. The distribution group sounds like one of the
</I>&gt;<i> best ways I can think of to prepare the JOS Project for the next level.
</I>
I agree.

&gt;<i> I have reason to believe the JOS Project needs a distribution group and has
</I>&gt;<i> needed it for quite some time. The demand for JOS distribution has not been
</I>&gt;<i> met by CVS or Source Server. CVS is too complex for only trying to take JOS
</I>&gt;<i> for a test drive. (The Internet tradition is to offer a .tar.gz and .zip
</I>&gt;<i> test drive with zero complexity.) The Source Server might have helped but
</I>&gt;<i> it is fatally broken. (It doesn't get the job done.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the distribution group is not needed already, it might be needed soon.
</I>&gt;<i> Why wait?
</I>
At the very least they can start getting organized now.

Cheers,
DigiGod

	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute

	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
