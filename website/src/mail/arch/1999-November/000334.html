<PRE>Question: Is it possible that we are talking about two different device
driver environments?

There are these things, written in native code, that must plug deeply into
the JOSBox. Can't we call them &quot;modules&quot;? If I remember right, these are
called &quot;modules&quot; in Linux. You can plug Linux modules into the kernel, so
that you don't have to recompile the kernel each time your configuration
changes.

Ultimate JOS must have a &quot;module&quot; environment for kernel plug-ins. This
part of the definition of a JOSBox. For all those JOSBox plug-ins, the
executable code would be native to a processor. This is just like a shared
library (or dynamic link library) in a classic Java virtual machine. I know
we want to get away from shared libraries as much as possible; but, kernel
modules need to run in native code.

These aren't &quot;device drivers&quot; in the typical sense; and yet, they are used
to help device drivers use the hardware. I think &quot;JOSBoxExtensions&quot; would
be a bad name for these things.

On the other hand, &quot;device drivers&quot; are supposed to be written in pure
bytecode. Device drivers are plugged into the class loader and device
architecture. Many different device drivers should share modules written in
native code. While modules might be dependent on CPU and platform, device
drivers should not.

Let's look at dial-up networking as a device driver. It uses the serial
port. It presents an interface that makes it look like a network card. It
uses and is used by the TCP/IP stack.

It is possible to write dial-up networking in pure bytecode. In fact, you
could almost write dial-up networking using the javax.comm.* package. In
turn, the TCP/IP stack might use a network card. The physical network card
won't talk to pure bytecode without the help of an network &quot;module&quot; running
inside the JOSBox. A network module is not required for every machine; but,
if it exists it must plug into the &quot;module&quot; environment provided by the
JOSBox.

When a &quot;module&quot; environment is provided by the JOSBox, programmers can
write all kinds of modules to run on JOS, just like they write shared
libraries to run inside a JVM.

The interface between the JVM and the kernel should be simple. The JVM
should be able to &quot;discover&quot; any module that's plugged into the JOSBox. The
way the JVM sees the &quot;module&quot; environment of the JOSBox is entirely
different than the way a &quot;module&quot; sees the &quot;module&quot; environment. &quot;Modules&quot;
live inside the environment. The JVM uses the &quot;module&quot; environment.

In this scenario, C/C++ programmers and Java programmers must work
together. While C/C++ programmers should write ethernet access as a JOSBox
module, Java programmers could write a TCP/IP stack that uses ethernet
access. Of course, the bytecode that implements TCP/IP wouldn't work on a
JOSBox without the ethernet module running. While the C/C++ code must
change from one JOSBox to the next, the bytecode doesn't have to.

When we take this one step farther, a stable version of Ultimate JOS would
not implement &quot;loadLibrary()&quot; like any other JVM. For JOS and only JOS, the
&quot;loadLibrary()&quot; method would search for a pre-loaded module already running
inside the environment. Maybe it could dynamically load it if it doesn't
already exist. Maybe not.

It means that you could configure your JOSBox at boot-time for all of the
modules it is allowed to use. Like Linux, these modules are never
loaded/unloaded except at boot-time.

It means that you could have all shared librarys (or &quot;modules&quot;) configured
to meet the needs of a specific machine. When the OS is configured, you
decide which shared libraries you want to use.

When all of the device drivers and all of the applications are written in
bytecode anyway, what difference does it make? Since Ultimate JOS won't be
compatible with shared libraries from Linux or dynamic link libraries from
Windows, JOS shared libraries must implement whatever interface we decide
when they run on Ultimate JOS.

These &quot;modules&quot; can be source-code compatible with shared libraries from
Linux and dynamic link libraries from Windows.
