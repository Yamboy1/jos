Could you please explain the parts of the rpm standard.

As for my proposal, it doesn't seem to be practical after all. I tried it
and I don't like it. I have simplified it to this:

smartapi1a-1.zip
smartapi1a-1.tgz

I should use -1, -2, -3 to indicate the distribution. Each distribution
should be uniquely numbered. Inside this archive, everything is safely
tucked away in its smartapi1a-1 directory.

Smart API is a product line. The Smart API - Release 1a is specific release
of the Smart API. Release 1a does not go out of style -- nor does it become
obsolete -- with the introduction of Release 1b or 2a. In fact, Release 1b
is dependent on Release 1a. Release 2a is dependent on Releases 1a and 1b.

I use &quot;1a&quot; instead of 1.0, &quot;1b&quot; instead of 1.1, &quot;2a&quot; instead of 2.0 because
1b does not replace 1a; 2a does not replace 1b or 1a.

&gt;<i>A zip file within a zip file?
</I>
Yes. It is a good idea. There are many people who only want to take JOS for
a test drive. They do not want to compile any source code. For all those
people, they can leave source code inside its archive. A number of
different programming tools enable you to &quot;browse&quot; the source code directly
from such an archive.

Many people put a jar file in a .tgz or .zip file. Since a jar is an
archive, that's an archive inside an archive.

&gt;<i>Do you mean a forking kit? ie. a distribution that is specifically
</I>&gt;<i>designed to be modified from the original?
</I>
I have never before heard of a forking kit. From your description, that's
not exactly what I had in mind. I meant that members of the JOS Project
should download the technical distribution in order to build unique
distributions of JOS.

For an open source project, three kinds of customers are recognized. The
JOS Project should care for all three:

1. People who do not care about source code at all.
2. People who only read source code
3. People who read and write source code.

1. For people who do not care about source code at all:
A &quot;runtime&quot; distribution is a special distribution for people who do not
care about source code at all. While it might be hard for a programmer to
imagine, this kind of customer is critical to the long term success of any
distribution.

2. For people who only read source code:
A &quot;source code&quot; distribution is a special distribution for people, like me,
who want to read source code. They neither want to modify nor compile an
existing product. This kind of customer has great interest in using the
techniques and models found in the JOS Project. This kind of customer will
write new applications that run on top of JOS.

3. People who read and write source code:
A &quot;technical&quot; distribution is a special distribution for people who want to
write source code for the JOS Project. They want to read the source code
for other JOS products and write their own. This kind of customer is
critical for the development of valuable JOS-related subsystems, like a
file subsystem, object registry and device drivers.

Note: CVS is an appropriate solution for developing and distributing a
mixed-language JOS kernel. A binary (or runtime) distribution is available
for people, like me, who want to take JOS for a test drive.
