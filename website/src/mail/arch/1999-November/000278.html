</I>&gt;<i> &gt;May I suggest we follow the rpm standard which is something more like:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;smartapi1a-1.1-1.src.zip
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(or .tar.gz)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Could you please explain the parts of the rpm standard.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for my proposal, it doesn't seem to be practical after all. I tried it
</I>&gt;<i> and I don't like it. I have simplified it to this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> smartapi1a-1.zip
</I>&gt;<i> smartapi1a-1.tgz
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I should use -1, -2, -3 to indicate the distribution. Each distribution
</I>&gt;<i> should be uniquely numbered. Inside this archive, everything is safely
</I>&gt;<i> tucked away in its smartapi1a-1 directory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Smart API is a product line. The Smart API - Release 1a is specific release
</I>&gt;<i> of the Smart API. Release 1a does not go out of style -- nor does it become
</I>&gt;<i> obsolete -- with the introduction of Release 1b or 2a. In fact, Release 1b
</I>&gt;<i> is dependent on Release 1a. Release 2a is dependent on Releases 1a and 1b.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I use &quot;1a&quot; instead of 1.0, &quot;1b&quot; instead of 1.1, &quot;2a&quot; instead of 2.0 because
</I>&gt;<i> 1b does not replace 1a; 2a does not replace 1b or 1a.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;A zip file within a zip file?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. It is a good idea. There are many people who only want to take JOS for
</I>&gt;<i> a test drive. They do not want to compile any source code. For all those
</I>&gt;<i> people, they can leave source code inside its archive. A number of
</I>&gt;<i> different programming tools enable you to &quot;browse&quot; the source code directly
</I>&gt;<i> from such an archive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Many people put a jar file in a .tgz or .zip file. Since a jar is an
</I>&gt;<i> archive, that's an archive inside an archive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Do you mean a forking kit? ie. a distribution that is specifically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;designed to be modified from the original?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have never before heard of a forking kit. From your description, that's
</I>&gt;<i> not exactly what I had in mind. I meant that members of the JOS Project
</I>&gt;<i> should download the technical distribution in order to build unique
</I>&gt;<i> distributions of JOS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For an open source project, three kinds of customers are recognized. The
</I>&gt;<i> JOS Project should care for all three:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. People who do not care about source code at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. People who only read source code
</I>&gt;<i> 3. People who read and write source code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. For people who do not care about source code at all:
</I>&gt;<i> A &quot;runtime&quot; distribution is a special distribution for people who do not
</I>&gt;<i> care about source code at all. While it might be hard for a programmer to
</I>&gt;<i> imagine, this kind of customer is critical to the long term success of any
</I>&gt;<i> distribution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. For people who only read source code:
</I>&gt;<i> A &quot;source code&quot; distribution is a special distribution for people, like me,
</I>&gt;<i> who want to read source code. They neither want to modify nor compile an
</I>&gt;<i> existing product. This kind of customer has great interest in using the
</I>&gt;<i> techniques and models found in the JOS Project. This kind of customer will
</I>&gt;<i> write new applications that run on top of JOS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. People who read and write source code:
</I>&gt;<i> A &quot;technical&quot; distribution is a special distribution for people who want to
</I>&gt;<i> write source code for the JOS Project. They want to read the source code
</I>&gt;<i> for other JOS products and write their own. This kind of customer is
</I>&gt;<i> critical for the development of valuable JOS-related subsystems, like a
</I>&gt;<i> file subsystem, object registry and device drivers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note: CVS is an appropriate solution for developing and distributing a
</I>&gt;<i> mixed-language JOS kernel. A binary (or runtime) distribution is available
</I>&gt;<i> for people, like me, who want to take JOS for a test drive.
</I>
Whatever we use internally all people should see is somesort of &quot;download manager&quot; Applet or at least some nice HTML pages, no one likes dealing with bland directories of cryptic file names (these pages could be part of the distribution groups job).

Cheers,
DigiGod

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
