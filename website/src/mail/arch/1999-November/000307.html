<PRE>&gt;<i> Here! Here! I hear a lot of discussion about a native kernel. JOS
</I>&gt;<i> architecture does not require a native kernel. Like all Java bytecode, all
</I>&gt;<i> you need is a JVM. I wish there was more discussion about the Java-side of
</I>&gt;<i> JOS.
</I>
Then why is there a need for JOS, last time I checked there are quite a
few VMs out there!
 
&gt;<i> As a Java-related project, JOS fills in the missing pieces in the Java
</I>&gt;<i> class libraries. It is a loose collection of additional applications and
</I>&gt;<i> services, like FTP, HTTP, and TELNET. In addition, it fixes some of the
</I>&gt;<i> defects in the Java class libraries, including backward compatibility and
</I>&gt;<i> future orientation.
</I>
Sure, Java implementations of these kinds of utilities would be a useful
part of the operating system, but what most of us (especially in
Jos-kernel) are interested in doing is bringing the JVM closer to the
hardware.
 
&gt;<i> JOS does not require you to replace your favorite machine. JOS does not
</I>&gt;<i> require you to replace your native operating system. But JOS enables you to
</I>&gt;<i> learn one desktop/shell/browser mechanism and carry it with you wherever
</I>&gt;<i> you go.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the Mac, JOS appears as a native GUI program. Inside the GUI window, JOS
</I>&gt;<i> has its own set of desktop/shell/browser configurations. JOS supports
</I>&gt;<i> multiple desktops. You start your Mac OS and then start your JOS desktop.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is the same for people who use Linux/UNIX (and X/Windows) and people who
</I>&gt;<i> use Microsoft MS-DOS (and Microsoft Windows).
</I>
Hmm not quite, we may want to have a clear separation of JOS into two
parts:

Native code / kernel + java drivers etc

Another piece with window managers and all the applications you talk
about.

But the point is that conventional OSes weren't designed to run Java, so
we can expect that they don't deliver maximal performance or resource
usage. 

We have to see if we can do better, and in doing so create some 'identity'
for JOS. People aren't going to want to develop applications (like ftp)
for JOS unless they can identify with something like a bootable OS.
