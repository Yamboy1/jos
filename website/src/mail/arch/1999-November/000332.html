You bring up an important issue. It would be a disaster to have source code
inside CVS and Source Server, especially if they were different. The
mechanism has not yet been established for synchronizing Source Server.

There is another way. I'm not sure we're ready for it yet.

Imagine that new code were uploaded to CVS. After code is uploaded to CVS,
someone downloads it; periodically, they take a snapshot. From the
snapshot, both a source and binary distribution can be created. Class files
do not have to be pre-compiled and uploaded to CVS. Anyone can download a
distribution with a HTML browser, without using CVS.

This person could run the source code through a syntax highlighter and
pretty printer to create static HTML files. Static HTML files reduce the
burden on our web server. The static HTML files are uploaded to our
Internet website for everyone to browse. All of the heaving processing is
off-line. Tools can be debugged and improved over a long period of time.

1. The HTML-formatted source code could not possibly ruin the source code,
like Source Server did.

2. Pages of HTML-formatted source code should be linked to their
corresponding distribution. When you pick on class, you download the
product that contains the package that contains the class. You don't
download one class at a time.

&gt;<i>For now, if you don't want to use CVS, then please, just make an 
</I>&gt;<i>archive file (.tgz, .zip, or .jar) available for download.
</I>
Authors that do not know CVS can make their distribution available as an
archive. If product development is shared by many authors, a distribution
might be uploaded to CVS and maintained there.

&gt;<i>A new &quot;loose&quot; source repository similar to the old source server is 
</I>&gt;<i>on the long list of todo items for the new jos website.
</I>
A static version of the Source Server is possible. It would be written in
Java, of course. After all of the bugs are removed, it could be easily
transformed into a Java servlet. As a servlet, you'd upload source code
archives to your web server instead of pre-processed HTML pages. It would
require a Java-enabled HTTP server.

As you might know, I have already developed a syntax highlighter for Java,
C/C++ and COBOL source code. They started out as simple batch HTML
generators, like JavaDoc. Behold the power of Java as these evolved into
Java servlets where the HTML is generated on-the-fly and never stored.
