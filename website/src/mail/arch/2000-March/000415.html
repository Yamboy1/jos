Thanks for the effort Gilbert! I will try and fit it in this framework when
i have something working.
Currently i'm thinking of ways to process timed events throughout the whole
stack.
I have decided i would like to use a variation on the famous Delta-list, as
it seems to be the easiest way to schedule events with varying periods, as
well as one time event. For periodic events i'm toying with the idea of
having them reschedule themselves upon execution.

This brings us to my present dilemma: should every part of the stack that
needs timing (ARP for cache expiration, route tables, TCP etc) have it's
own delta queue (at the expense of one thread plus a fixed overhead per
list) or should i go for the added complexity of puttign everything in one
deltalist, thereby lowering the overhead?
Personally i have the feeling i should go for the first alternative. If i
had been after speed i would not have chosen JAVA in the first place, and
reducing complexity always pays off more than increasing performance in the
long run.

What do you guys think? I need your input! :)

Ranieri.
