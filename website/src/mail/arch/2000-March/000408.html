<PRE>Try this on your off-the-shelf virtual machine:

  public void example() {
    throw new NoSuchFieldError();
  }

What happens? What should happen? When any method throws an extension of
&quot;java.lang.Error&quot;, what happens to your virtual machine? Can an applet
throw an error? Can a servlet?

There are two kinds of class file reflection: pure and practical. The first
kind is pure reflection as demonstrated in the com.realignsoft.reflection2a
package. The second kind is practical reflection as demonstrated in
java.lang and java.lang.reflect.

As of this morning, I have a simple, step-by-step procedure that you can
perform on your own computer to demonstrate for yourself the difference
between pure and practical reflection. This demonstrates that practical
reflection is very optimistic. It does not anticipate that anything might
go wrong in the reflection of a class. It assumes a class file is valid and
passes verification.

With any binary editor, create an incomplete class file:

1. Call it 'Sample.class'.
2. Store four bytes, 0xCA, 0xFE, 0xBE and 0xBE, at the beginning of the file.
3. Save it.
4. Check the size of the new file; it must be 4.

With pure reflection, load the 'Sample.class' file as a Bytecode object.
The Bytecode object will be created successfully, without shutting down
your virtual machine.

  public void example() {
    Bytecode bc;
    try {
      bc = new BasicBytecode( &quot;Sample.class&quot; );
    }
    catch( Throwable e ) {
    }
  }

With practical reflection, load 'Sample.class' as an instance of
java.lang.Class, with something like this:

  public void example() {
    Class c;
    try {
      c = Class.forName( &quot;Sample&quot; );
    }
    catch( Throwable e ) {
    }
  }


What happens to your virtual machine? Practical reflection is a bit
optimistic, isn't it? It expects all the class files to be perfect.

About jJOS/decaf:
How does jJOS/decaf handle an error? Will an error bring down the whole
operating system? As shown, any application that uses practical reflection
has the potential to throw an error. If I have 50+ applications running on
jJOS/decaf and one of them loads a malformed class file, does that bring
down my operating system?

While I might desire JOS to load many applications inside one virtual
machine, I cannot use an operating system that fails when one of its hosted
application fails. I believe the architecture of JOS should be slightly
different than jJOS/decaf in the following way:

For optimization, all bytecode should be intern'd. The virtual machine
class must maintain the list of intern'd bytecode across all virtual machines.

Each virtual machine is an *instance* of decaf. Each virtual machine has
its own object space. Each virtual machine has its own garbage collector.
When an error is thrown inside one virtual machine, it shuts down one
virtual machine. All other instances of a virtual machine are independent.

This says nothing of preemptive or non-preemptive multi-tasking. More than
one instance of decaf can be created without moving to preemptive
multi-tasking. The virtual machine class becomes responsible for
maintaining a list of all the bytecode that has every been used
(virtually). Each instance of the virtual machine uses the internBytecode()
method to get the bytecode it uses.

JOS must be a robust, reliable, dependable, rock solid, stable, hard
working operating system. If it fails just because an error is thrown, an
operating system will be none of that.
