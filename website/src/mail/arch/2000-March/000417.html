Here we need a little bit of caution. We have to think about the impact of
this on the architecture. As an architect, I worry about this is the kind
of thing. The asynchronous TCP service I wrote does not need to be
JOS-specific. I can use it in any Java application. Anything that does not
need to be JOS-specific should not be JOS-specific.

It doesn't need to go inside the JEPS package, does it?

When I mentioned a TCP service, I had JEPS in mind but in a different way.
I think JEPS runs in its own user process. JEPS must run in a user process
so that it can be started, shutdown and restarted. Typically, JOS will be
configured to starts JEPS at start-up. It is a system-wide protocol stack.
There is only one. Or rather, one for each network interface card.

A network interface card is a limited resource. If JEPS ran in each user
process, only one would obtain the driver for each network interface card.

A service that uses JEPS runs in its own user process, too. It does not run
in the same process with JEPS. A service must run in a user process so that
it can be started, shutdown and restarted.

Personally, I would like use a corresponding UDP service, but have no idea
where to begin. I have never written a UDP client or daemon using the
standard class libraries.

&gt;<i>This brings us to my present dilemma: should every part of the stack that

Your answer might come from thinking about the extreme case. Imagine you
have a processor that is so slow it can only process one event per second.
If someone has scheduled three events to occur each second, spawning
additional threads won't help.

Like you said, the schedule must be updated at the beginning of each event.
A scheduler must know when an event started. A schedule is really a
mimimum. At least one interval must pass from the beginning of one event
and the beginning of another.

If an event takes almost one second to process and someone has scheduled it
for once every second, the actual interval begins to depend on the
efficiency of the scheduler. The scheduler itself takes time to schedule
the next event.

When you have three scheduled events with the same priority, the event with
the longest delay since it should have been launched must be launched first.

Write a scheduler. I imagine that one scheduler class can be written. While
one configuration might use one instance of the scheduler for all events,
another might use more than one. Each event scheduler should run in its own
thread.

This is a true story. Our business program was scheduled to run once each
day. Over time, more and more features were added. We don't know exactly
when, but at some point it ran for more than 24 hours. The original
scheduler launched each program in a separate thread. So one Thursday
morning in the middle of 1988, the first and second instance were running
at the same time. On Friday morning, the first, second and third instances
were running. The first instance didn't finish in 48 hours because both the
first and second were competing for the same resources. The first instance
didn't finish in 72 hours because the first, second and third were
competing for the same resources. Needless to say, none of the data
processed by the program could be used. Programmers didn't expect more than
one instance to run at the same time.
