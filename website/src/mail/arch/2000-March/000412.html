<PRE>Release 4 of WebSource 3a is available now in the &quot;redist&quot; directory at
&lt;URL:<A HREF="http://www.jos.org/redist/mirror">http://www.jos.org/redist/mirror</A>&gt;. Here are some of its latest features:

1. On a package statement, a package name is linked to its package page.
When inside the source code for a class, you can move to a list of classes
for the package. This enables you to provide a link to a specific *class*
when sending URLs to other programmers.

2. An import statement has two forms. You can import a class or a package.
On an import package statement, such as &quot;import java.awt.*;&quot;, a package
name is linked to its package page. As before, an import class statement,
such as &quot;import java.awt.Button;&quot;, a class name is linked to its class page.

3. Configuration options have been added (at last!) to JavaSourceProgram.
This is the first release of version 3a that enables you to put a custom
banner at the top of each class page. This is stored in configuration.txt,
loaded through the Registry API.

4. Choose your own custom colors. Title, link and vlink colors have been
added to the list of configurable colors. The title color is used as a
background for the title box on each class page. The link and vlink colors
are used on every page. As with previous versions, custom colors include
foreground, background, keyword, constant and comment.

5. A package alias is supported for the first time in version 3a. As with
previous versions, an alias is a (shorter) replacement for a full package
name. This capability is most important when publishing HTML on a CD-ROM.

-----

To do:

WebSource 3a is the first version that supports plug-ins. Ryan Heise
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:ryan@whitewolf.com.au">ryan@whitewolf.com.au</A>&gt; has been a tremendous help in defining a new
plug-in for full featured java-&gt;html conversion. We might be able to add
pretty printing. We'll keep you posted.

I am thinking about a full class index program. Such a program would sort
all classes in alphabetical order, display their package name, and link to
their corresponding class page. There would also be a corresponding
multi-product full class index for multi-product vaults.
