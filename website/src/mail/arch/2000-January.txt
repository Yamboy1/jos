Subject: [JOS-Arch] Alt Packages

Here is a summary of the "alt" packages procedure, one step at a time.

1. Download source code from the classpath project. Connect to their CVS
using the anonymous name and password. Instructions are found on their
website <URL:http://www.classpath.org/>

2. Write a program to copy source code from classpath to alt, modifying
package and import statements along the way:

java.applet -> alt.applet.2
java.awt -> alt.awt.2
java.awt.image -> alt.awt.2.image
java.awt.peer -> alt.awt.2.peer
java.awt.peer.gtk -> org.classpath.gtkpeer.2
java.bean -> alt.bean.2
java.io -> alt.io.2
java.lang -> alt.lang.2
java.math -> alt.math.2
java.net -> alt.net.2
java.sql -> alt.sql.2
java.util -> alt.util.2

3. Create a project file (or use bulkmake).

4. Compile all source code into .class files.

Hello all!

It is with great pleasure that i announce to all of you on the arch and
kernel lists that my stab at an IP Stack in Java finally actually does
something. As most of you probably already know UDP is a very simple
protocol built on top of IP, that provides little extra features besided
port numbers and being accessible from userspace. It was therefore not
extremely difficult to implement rudimental UDP into JEPS once i had IP and
ICMP sort of working.

Next i started implementing clones of selected methods of some java.net
classes in order to get sample programs to run on JEPS, and to my surprise
it worked rather well.

Incorporated into release 0.001e of JEPS is the example UDP server program
"QuoteServer"
(http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/networking/datagrams/clientServer.h
tml) that replies to UDP packets on a certain port with a quote extracted
from a file, or the current time if this file is unavailable. The
QuoteServerThread class has been modified only slightly to fit into JEPS
and works, as far as have been able to tell, perfectly. 
I urge you all to give it a little more perusal :)

You can get the JEPS Stack's latest version from
http://villa28.cs.kpn.cx/jos/ as usual, or refer to the TCPIPStack and JEPS
topics on the WIKI-web.

There are at least three products called "AWT". It is most difficult to
undo this kind of mistake. I would like to think of them as "AWT for Java 0
Platform", "AWT for Java 1 Platform" and "AWT for Java 2 Platform".

Why do I think about "peer" as a subpackage of "alt.awt2"? Because each
implementation of "peer" is closely associated with a specific
implementation of "AWT". Since each AWT has a different number of packages,
my proposal is this:

AWT for Java 0 Platform:
alt.awt0=java.awt
alt.awt0.image=java.awt.image
alt.awt0.peer=java.awt.peer

AWT for Java 1 Platform:
alt.awt1=java.awt
alt.awt1.datatransfer=java.awt.datatransfer
alt.awt1.event=java.awt.event
alt.awt1.image=java.awt.image
alt.awt1.peer=java.awt.peer
alt.awt1.print=java.awt.print

AWT for Java 2 Platform:
alt.awt2=java.awt
alt.awt2.datatransfer=java.awt.datatransfer
alt.awt2.event=java.awt.event
alt.awt2.image=java.awt.image
alt.awt2.peer=java.awt.peer
alt.awt2.print=java.awt.print
:
etc.

The alt.* packages are not intended to fix all namespace mistakes. You are
correct. "alt.awt2.peer" does not make sense to enlightened folks. If we
were dealing with a brand new design, I might have used something like this:

alt.datatransfer2=java.awt.datatransfer
alt.event2=java.awt.event
alt.image2=java.awt.image
alt.peer2=java.awt.peer
alt.print2=java.awt.print

Event-driven programs, for example, are not the exclusive domain of visual
applications. We know this from the event-driven device drivers for JOS.
Therefore, the event package should not have been tied exclusively to the AWT.

The print package is obviously non-visual (right?). Since AWT components
can be used for printing, AWT has itself become something where visual is
optional.

-----

Like you said earlier, we can't use "2" as a package name. And why not?
Because a javac tool refuses to compile any package in a directory called
"2". I tried to compile a package called "2" to see what might happen. It
did not work at all. Package names, like other identifiers, must start with
a letter (A-Z, a-z) or an underscore.

My most-recently-used platform-map.ini file looks something like this:

[java2-map]
alt.applet2=java.applet
alt.awt2=java.awt
alt.awt2.datatransfer=java.awt.datatransfer
alt.awt2.event=java.awt.event
alt.awt2.image=java.awt.image
alt.awt2.peer=java.awt.peer
alt.awt2.print=java.awt.print
alt.beans2=java.beans
alt.beans2.beancontext=java.beans.beancontext
alt.beans2.editors=java.beans.editors
alt.beans2.info=java.beans.info
alt.io2=java.io
alt.io2.decode=java.io.decode
alt.io2.encode=java.io.encode
alt.lang2=java.lang
alt.lang2.ref=java.lang.ref
alt.lang2.reflect=java.lang.reflect
alt.locale2=java.locale
alt.math2=java.math
alt.net2=java.net
alt.security2=java.security
alt.security2.acl=java.security.acl
alt.security2.cert=java.security.cert
alt.security2.der=java.security.der
alt.security2.interfaces=java.security.interfaces
alt.security2.provider=java.security.provider
alt.security2.spec=java.security.spec
alt.security2.util=java.security.util
alt.sql2=java.sql
alt.text2=java.text
alt.util2=java.util

-----

These classes seems to be part of the core:

java.lang.Object
java.lang.Class
java.lang.ClassLoader
java.lang.Throwable
java.lang.Exception
java.lang.RuntimeException

java.lang.String is part of the core because it is a final class. And yet,
it has changed in incompatible ways from one platform to the next.

We must not confuse "important" with "necessary". How do we determine if a
class is part of the core or not? Is it possible to run a virtual machine
without it.

There is nothing inherent in a virtual machine that requires a network. The
java.net.* package is not required by a virtual machine; it is not part of
the true core. Just as a command line (CL) program might never use
java.awt, many programs might never use java.net. The java.net package is
important to us as network application programmers. It is not important to
a stand-alone application.

Let me put it another way. Sun Microsystems could have easily implemented a
network package in javax.net and distributed it with every Java Virtual
Machine. A program that needs Sun Microsystems' network package could have
used javax.net.

We can implement network packages in alt.net0, alt.net1 and alt.net2 and
distribute these packages with every virtual machine. Any program that
needs network support can use alt.net0, alt.net1 and alt.net2.

A version-less virtual machine is a direct consequence of the "run
anywhere" dream. An alternative namespace is a direct consequence of a
version-less virtual machine.

Many problems in the Java platform today are a direct consequence of
incompatible "platforms", or vm versioning. True platform independence
comes from perfect backward compatibility. Unfortunately, the java.* and
javax.* namespace have been misused. The javax.* namespace has been
mistakenly used two completely different purposes.

Sun Microsystems had the perfect opportunity. If Sun Microsystems did the
right thing, this conversation would not be required. They could have
created a version-less virtual machine. They could have kept javax.* for
its original purpose (as their personal alternative namespace) instead of
mangling it for standard extensions to the Java class libraries.

1. An alternative namespace is necessary to develop classes that are
(eventually) copied to the java.* namespace. This is alt.*.

2. Another namespace must be reserved and managed for the development of
industry-standard mostly-bytecode extensions to the core Java libraries.
This is javax.*.

Package names are critical to the success of the alternative namespace.
While I hoped Sun Microsystems would embrace javax.* as the alternative
namespace for Java class libraries, they have rejected it in practice.
While Sun Microsystems promised write once and run anywhere, the ability to
write and run a Java 0 Platform application has been seriously undermined
by Sun since the introduction of JDK 1.1.0.

I do not want anyone to think that the alternative namespace is controlled,
managed, implemented or designed by Sun Microsystems. "java0" looks too
much like "javax". A generalization of "java0", "java1" and "java2" would
be java[n] (or java[x]).

I am trying to put distance between our alternative and a specification
dictated by Sun Microsystems. By calling it alt.awt2, it should be less
likely to get our classes confused with packages from Sun Microsystems.

 - Our alternative namespace is a mechanism, an approach, a procedure, in
which we can build and test classes for a bytecode virtual machine. It is a
stepping stone. Through the experience of the alternative namespace, we can
methodically prove the strengths and weakness of both bytecode technology
in general and bytecode storage in package-sized units.

 - Our alternative namespace is neither a direct implementation of the Java
Language Specification nor Java Virtual Machine specification. It is a
means to an end.

 - Our alternative namespace is not "Java", does not contain "Java", and
should not be confused with a Java "standard" library.

Each alternative package is a stand-alone and fully functional class
library. It can be used as-is, fully compatible with an off-the-shelf Java
Virtual Machine. Down the road, we might use it as the basis for a clone of
the Java standard library.

-----

Package names are critical to the adoption of class libraries by other
programmers. Demand for "pure" Java includes the mistaken idea that a Java
application must depend only on classes in the java.* namespace.

When programmers know that all these packages are built and endorsed by Sun
Microsystems, they are reassured when a package is part of the java.*
namespace. They are generally uncomfortable with an application that
depends on class libraries that are "non-standard", or outside the java.*
namespace.

It is unfortunate and cruel for Java programmers to suffer the effects of
three incompatible implementations of the java.* namespace. "Run anywhere"
is a direct victim of three incompatible implementations of java.*. Sun
promised compatibility.

By strict interpretation of the package-naming convension, our alternative
class libraries should be called:

org.jos.alt.platform[n]

where java.awt corresponds to

org.jos.alt.platform0.awt,
org.jos.alt.platform1.awt, and
org.jos.alt.platform2.awt

In an attempt to make the alternative namespace "bigger" than the JOS
Project, java.awt corresponds to

alt.platform0.awt,
alt.platform1.awt, and
alt.platform2.awt

It was my desire to develop different packages side-by-side. By further
reduction, java.awt corresponds to

alt.awt0,
alt.awt1, and
alt.awt2

Optimally, I would prefer to use a standard pre-processor to compile
alternative packages into the alt.* namespace. In other words, the
single-source for all three versions of the AWT would be found in

./common/alt/awt

and three passes of the compiler, one for each platform, would produce
these three packages:

alt.awt0,
alt.awt1, and
alt.awt2

-----

>we should use [package].v[x-x-x] for tech versions and [package].d[x[y]] for
>distribution versions; but what I said above for alt.*.

In general, I would develop a product with its own name and independent
version numbers.

And yet, "AWT 1.0" should not be our first version of three AWT clones.
Many programmers would prefer a direct association between the name of the
clone and its original implementation. Since one versions of the AWT has
been developed for each Java "platform", it is consistent to say "AWT for
Java 0 Platform", "AWT for Java 1 Platform" and "AWT for Java 2 Platform".
The logical package name for our completely finished, tested and
distributed clone of "AWT for the Java 0 Platform" should be:

 - alt.awt0
 - alt.awt.v0
 - alt.awt.platform0, or
 - alt.platform0.awt

A physical package name is actually implemented. A physical package name
for "AWT for the Java 0 Platform" prototype might be:

gchii.awt0a-1

or

digigod.awt.v0.d1

The name of a prototype is non-essencial. Only the name of the target,
production package is a matter of compromise and cooperation. As a
programmer, you must be willing (and able) to use a package name before you
compile it into your programs.

While I am willing to use three different versions of the Abstract
Windowing Toolkit, I am unable. The Java Virtual Machine specification
won't let me because they are all called by the same physical package name.

While I am able to use JFC/Swing when it is called com.sun.swing or
java.awt.swing, I am unwilling. I am working to invoke an identical
mostly-bytecode application on all three Java platforms. I want all of the
benefits of a "run anywhere" environment. I want the dream of "run
anywhere" to come true.

-----

We must repeatedly attempt to implement "AWT for the Java 0 Platform",
causing multiple, concurrent distributions, until it's good enough, or we
get it "right". And yet, we do not want to recompile every application that
uses "AWT for the Java 0 Platform" after each distribution. While the
implementation might change, the API/framework must remain stable.

Selecting one distribution among many is what classpath is for. A
distribution is only a snapshot. Adding "distribution" to a package name
would require a programmer to rename all classes and recompile all
applications that depend on those classes with each distribution.

When you put distribution in a package name, you have gone too far. I have
never used "distribution" in a package name. I am unable (and unwilling) to
use two different distributions of a package simultaneously in a virtual
machine.

A "version" or "prototype" of a package is different. I can use two
versions of a package simultaneously in a virtual machine. Instead of a
secret namespace, I use a "release" (or version[prototype]) in a package name.

I created at least five distributions of the Smart API - Release 2a
product. The critical package is called org.jos.smartapi2a in every case.
The API/framework has remained stable. Following my own Smart API Proposal,
all public classes, public and protected methods, public fields cannot be
altered without changing a physical package name. I can independently
improve the Smart API subsystem without recompiling any application that
depends on it.

Even the name of the archive is smartapi2a.jar in every case. I can
"upgrade" to a new smartapi2a.jar without changing any shell script that
depends on it.

From: Gilbert Carl Herschberger II gchii@mindspring.com
Subject: [JOS-Arch] Alt Packages - Status

What we call a class is important, critical when the alternative packages
are used in mostly-bytecode applications. Once a package has been used in
an application, we should not rename it.

I am also concerned with creating classes that work. My attempt to copy
source code from the Classpath Project in bulk has not been successful. I
was hoping that 90-95% of the code would compile and run. I hoped to add
all the classes and then remove the classes that gave me trouble. This is
taking far too long.

Today, I am taking a different approach. I'm going to add one class at a
time. In other words, I am going to approach this as if I wrote each class
by hand. Starting with a short list of classes from the Java 0 Platform, I
am adding them to the alt.* namespace along with brand new test programs.

Like extreme programming, all classes will be compiled without error each
day. Classes that have been compiled can be tested and used.

Where I might have used a class in java.util, I'll start using a class from
alt.platform0.util, alt.platform1.util, alt.platform2.util whenever I can.

Question: Why should I implement all three?

alt.util0.Enumeration,
alt.util1.Enumeration, and
alt.util2.Enumeration

Answer: The alt.* packages are future oriented. It is possible that each of
these classes might have different methods and fields. While Enumeration is
identical for the first three Java platforms, there is no guarantee that
Java 3, 4 and 5 Platforms will even implement a class called Enumeration.
Who knows what its methods and fields will be?

Subject: [JOS-Arch] run:main: sub-scheme

Within Smart API, the run:main: sub-scheme corresponds to the main()
method. Of course, a main() method is a public static void main( String[] )
method.

The MainProgramController implements a run:main: sub-scheme. In a clever
twist, this controller uses run:program: to invoke MainProgram. In turn,
MainProgram uses practical reflection to invoke any class which implements
a main() method.

Unfortunately, this was not working correctly in Distribution 5 of Smart
API - Release 2a. It is fixed for the next distribution.

-----

For example, the CommandLineBrowser class implements a main() method. To
start the CommandLineBrowser, use the following URI:

run:main:org.jos.gchii.commandlinebrowser1a.CommandLineBrowser

The java tool equivalent is:

java org.jos.gchii.commandlinebrowser1a.CommandLineBrowser

-----

To pass parameters (arguments) to main(), a URI uses a syntax like this:

run:main:org.jos.gchii.browser1b.UniversalBrowser?http://www.jos.org/

The java tool equivalent is:

java org.jos.gchii.browser1b.UniversalBrowser http://www.jos.org/

-----

The experimental command-line browser uses AWT components for its virtual
console, which the virtual console is under construction. I would like to
use a command-line browser on Linux and across a TELNET connection. I would
like to use a command-line browser like I use an MS-DOS Box on Windows 95.

	All of the platform/driver code has been moved to arch/*/bytecode
to allow for architecture-specific code; cvs update will need the create

Subject: [JOS-Arch] Coming Soon: Smart API - Release 2a - Distribution 6

Distribution 6 of Smart API - Release 2a is coming soon. It is part of JOS
Distribution 1e.

Get ready to take the Universal Browser for another test drive. With the OS
program controller, it puts "Universal" back in the Universal Browser. It
is nothing short of spectacular!

The Program Browser can run all these kinds of programs:

Java applications (run:main:)
JOS Programs (run:program:)
José Programs (run:jose:)
native OS programs (run:os:)

Here is how you get native OS programs in a mostly-bytecode shell.

1. The Universal Browser uses the Program Browser.
2. The Program Browser uses the Smart API.
3. The Smart API uses the all-new OSProgramController class.
4. The OSProgramController class converts run:os:somecommand to
run:program:org.jos.gchii.osprogram1a.OSProgram?cmd=somecommand
5. The OSProgram class uses java.lang.Process to start a native program and
redirect its output to a console.

-----

Run Java tools:

java tool - run:os:java someclass
javah tool - run:os:javah -jni someclass
jar tool - run:os:jar cvf somejar somefile
javadoc tool - run:os:javadoc -classpath somedirectory somepackage

-----

Run eric tool - run:os:eric
Run miniserver tool - run:os:minisrv

-----

About Windows(tm)

The run:os: subscheme is a prefix to a Windows(tm) command line. The
standard output is redirected to the browser's console.

Windows Explorer - run:os:explorer
Notepad - run:os:notepad
Registry Editor - run:os:regedit
Telnet - run:os:telnet
HTML Browser - run:os:start index.html
batch files - run:os:start somefile.bat

-----

About Linux(r)

The run:os: subscheme is a prefix to a Linux(r) command line. The standard
output is redirected to the browser's console.

ls - run:os:ls
tar - run:os:tar -xvzf somearchive.tgz
cat - run:os:cat somefile
find - run:os:find -name somefile

-----

The run: scheme is not just interactive. Embed it in your mostly-bytecode
applications to run other programs.

 - Redirect output to a file.
 - Run other programs within a script (batch mode).
 - Run other programs, including CGI scripts, from within a Java servlet.

-----

About desktop

Create a custom desktop with buttons for your favorite commands. The
Desktop Browser supports all kinds of schemes, including the new run:os:

>I've put in the right directory the Device.java provided by Hilary and the

>(EtherHostDriver.c). 

I should start out by saying that this hardly surprises me as i throwed the
native part together fairly rapidly in order to get onto the "real stuff" :\
As far as i know using the PF_PACKET socket and derived structs is the
reccomended mode to obtain a raw socket connection on linux as of kernel
2.2.xx. Some of the additional tricks i pull may need glibc 2.1 though. I
thought that these were widespread enough that they could be assumed, at
least in a developer community.
If i rely on something else i'm not aware of, please someone tell me :)

I know there is an older way to open sockets for raw data exchange that
goes like this:

fd=socket(AF_INET, SOCK_PACKET, htons(ETH_P_ALL));

instead of

packet_socket = socket(PF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(ETH_P_ALL));

but all the documentation on my machine suggested it was way better to use
the newer interface. If this is a problem to many of you i suppose i could
implement them both with a compiler directive of sorts.

The offending part of code (sockaddr_ll etc.) binds the socket to a
particular network device. I presume there should also be a
backward-compatible way of doing that, but i would need to do more
research. I presume it would entail using "sockaddr" instead of the
link-level specific "sockaddr_ll".
I fear that making a "general" unix ethhost.c would entail using libpcap
and libnet to capture and transmit raw frames.

>Ranieri, any suggestion ? 

Unfortunately not right now. What are your kernel and glibc versions?

>Have you used the sample code provided by Stevens (in
>Internetworking with TCP/IP) to open a socket in raw mode ?

Hmm, no. I only own volume two of the series and in this volume he uses a
phantomatical write() function that communicates with some sort of a driver.
Would you mind posting the relevant portion of that code? It might be
interesting ..
If the code is too big or anything just say so and i'll get my lazy butt
down to the library :)

Ranieri.

PS: Did anyone else (besides me) get this to work? Or am i just writing
code that will only compile on my machine? I'm using a mostly unaltered
slackware7 with 2.2.10 and a blackdown.org 1.1.xx java sdk. Come on! I know
that at least 13 of you have the latest version! :)

You're right, but someone (like me) could have an old version of linux,
thus i think the code should be patched including a compiler directive (i
have kernel 2.0.36 and glibc2.0). Anyway, tomorrow i'll try to apply the
patch you provided in opening socket.

.. no,no... not a "general unix" ethhost.c but, at least, a "general
linux" one! I think that looking the source code of "tcpdump" or "sniffer"
could help us!

The code snippet was not supposed to be a proper "patch", just an example
of code coded "the old way". Personally i'm not sure wether supporting a
kernel that is not even supported by Alan Cox anymore (he passed the tree
off to a volounteer that will make the 2.0.38 patch and then it's done) is
a wise decision, especially with 2.4.XX just around the corner (at least,
that's what Linus keeps saying on the kernel mailing list. I know better
than to believe him of course :)
Either way at the moment i do not have neither a 2.0.XX kernel nor glibc
2.0 handy, but if you get it working on your system i would be willing to
integrate it in the codebase.

All this code will get killed when we integrate into the native build
anyway, so it actually hardly matters :)

I based my code on that of a sniffer found in one of the phrack issues
(www.phrack.net). 
BTW, i hopped by the library today but Internetworking w/ TCP/IP Vol 1 was
already loaned out :(

	I'll try to look at this today -- and I'm also using a mostly

Subject: [JOS-Arch] JEPS and the Kernels.

>4. How the JEPS integrates and communicates with the kernels.

Since it's the second time today i get this question fired upon me, i fear
i have to apologise for the lacking documentation.
At this point in time, JEPS runs as a JAVA application on top of Linux
directly. It does not run in any of the kernels. It DOES need one of the
interfaces from the JJOS kernel (driver.java), because i thought at the
time this would make later integration easier. In fact this only seems to
make things needlessly more complicated. In fact, if it bothers you just
delete the "extends jos.arch.driver" (or something) line in the appropriate
file, it will not impact anything else in JEPS.

Again, i'd like to apologise to all for the lack of clarity in this matter.
Perhaps its time to redo JEPS docs :)

BTW: Work upon JEPS continues. Yesterday i have actually gotten the thing
to route packets according to a configurable route table, including
gateways, default route etc.
JEPS cannot act as a gateway yet, and it probably will be a while cause my
current network topology does not allow me to test it other than with a
"dummy" (fake) network. This is not in violation of any RFC (in fact,
packet forwarding is optional and must default to OFF) just look at win9x!
The two big features left to implement in the IP layer are
fragmenting/reassembly and multicasting. They are both required by RFC 1122
iirc.

Subject: [JOS-Arch] New JEPS release, multiple interfaces and routing.

I just put up the current JEPS code.

It includes a number of improvements in the IP and ARP category as well as
incipient error signalling through exceptions (really needed that!). Please
check it out :)
Plans for the immidiate future are mainly fragmentation and reassembly as
they are a fundamental part of the IP protocol.

I suppose i could move JEPS development onto the CVS in order to be able to
share access with ppl on a more dynamic basis. What do you guys think? How
would i go about in doing this?

How's the progress on native ne2000 drivers coming along? Is anyone
bothering with it yet?
If we get them even half working i'm willing to try the port, just to see
if it works.

I have a good feeling about this .. It might not end up to be the fastest
stack in the block, but  i think we are going to be able to make it
compliant to all the internet host requirements eventually.

Nice to see he finally made it from the gnu lists over to here.  *sigh*

I've made sure the company I work for will never buy from anybody that
appears to be remotely related to this guy.  Seems only fair.  Hopefully
others do the same thing.

Spamming works -- just not in the way the spammers had hoped for.

Subject: [JOS-Arch] Missing documentation

Let's take a look at JOS architecture from a wish-list point of view.

What is it we wish to have documented?

There is a big difference between (1) having no documentation, and (2)
having great documentation we can all enthusiastically agree with. Here is
an example. I believe that JOS is more than just a project to build
jJOS/decaf.

Assertion 1. JOS is an independent operating system; it does not depend on
another operating system for its functionality. It is not MS-DOS, Linux,
OS/2, MS-Windows, nor UNIX.

Do you agree? If not, why not?

Subject: [JOS-Arch] Smart API Example

I just wrote a program to grab .class files from rt.jar. The byte: scheme
converts any InputStream to a byte[]. The zip: scheme treats the embedded
URI as a ZIP file. Here's the basic idea:

URI uri = new URI( "in:byte:zip:[file:rt.jar]/java/lang/Class.class" );
byte[] buf = (byte[]) uri.getObject();
if ( buf == null ) {
  return;
}
:

How many lines of code would this take without the Smart API?

I think a first step is the description of the architecture, the core Java
classes and their hierarchy, what is native and not.

	Agreed.  How about this?

Assertion 2. JOS is a Java(TM)-based operating system.  Therefore, JOS
is written in Java wherever possible, and its native executable format is
the Java class file.

Ugh. You jumped right into the frying pan. How about this?

Assertion 2. The native executable format for JOS is the class file, as
documented in the Java(tm) Virtual Machine Specification(s).

JOS is an operating system for executing class files. Since this is the
native executable format, executable programs and shared libraries are
distributed as class files.

Premise 2a. Java, the programming language, is not required by JOS. JOS
runs any class file created by any programming language.

Premise 2b. Java, the standard class libraries, is not required by JOS.

Premise 2c. Java(tm) programs run on top of JOS. JOS does not run on top of
Java(tm) Platform. JOS is not based upon Java(tm), but executes Java(tm)
class files.

Assertion 3. JOS is fully independent of the tools necessary to create it.

In other words, we allow ourselves to skip over the development of a javac
tool that runs on JOS. JOS itself can be created on Linux (or a foreign
operating system).

	Okay, I see your point.  I'll paraphrase your three premises to
verify that I understand them.  (And, possibly, make things more concise
without loss of clarity.)

> Assertion 2. The native executable format for JOS is the class file, as
> documented in the Java(tm) Virtual Machine Specification(s).

	Therefore, JOS is language-agnostic, requiring neither the
Java(tm) language, nor the Java(tm) class libraries.  That is, the
Java(tm) platform runs on top of JOS.

	Could we then add (or perhaps it's implicit in the above?):

	Given that JOS is language-agnostic, it, and the libraries with
which it is distributed, are not limited to or by the capabilites of the
Java(tm) platform.

> Assertion 3. JOS is fully independent of the tools necessary to create it.

	Agreed.

Hi Todd,
You've disappeared for some days! I'm happy that you've returned :))
What's up with JOS-w/curses ? Have you downloaded my patched version of JOS
which runs a curses application ? What are your remarks ?

... and... to anyone in the list....
I've seen several downloads of "JOS-w-curses.tgz". Have you tested it ? Does it
run ? What are your remarks ?

Bye,

	I disappeared because I accidentally blew my hard drive away on
Saturday.  I need the URL for your patch again, because I lost all my old
