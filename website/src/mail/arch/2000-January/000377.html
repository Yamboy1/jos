<PRE>&gt;<i>4. How the JEPS integrates and communicates with the kernels.
</I>
Since it's the second time today i get this question fired upon me, i fear
i have to apologise for the lacking documentation.
At this point in time, JEPS runs as a JAVA application on top of Linux
directly. It does not run in any of the kernels. It DOES need one of the
interfaces from the JJOS kernel (driver.java), because i thought at the
time this would make later integration easier. In fact this only seems to
make things needlessly more complicated. In fact, if it bothers you just
delete the &quot;extends jos.arch.driver&quot; (or something) line in the appropriate
file, it will not impact anything else in JEPS.

Again, i'd like to apologise to all for the lack of clarity in this matter.
Perhaps its time to redo JEPS docs :)

BTW: Work upon JEPS continues. Yesterday i have actually gotten the thing
to route packets according to a configurable route table, including
gateways, default route etc.
JEPS cannot act as a gateway yet, and it probably will be a while cause my
current network topology does not allow me to test it other than with a
&quot;dummy&quot; (fake) network. This is not in violation of any RFC (in fact,
packet forwarding is optional and must default to OFF) just look at win9x!
The two big features left to implement in the IP layer are
fragmenting/reassembly and multicasting. They are both required by RFC 1122
iirc.
