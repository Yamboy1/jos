<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> but all the documentation on my machine suggested it was way better to use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the newer interface. If this is a problem to many of you i suppose i could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implement them both with a compiler directive of sorts.
</I>&gt;<i>You're right, but someone (like me) could have an old version of linux,
</I>&gt;<i>thus i think the code should be patched including a compiler directive (i
</I>&gt;<i>have kernel 2.0.36 and glibc2.0). Anyway, tomorrow i'll try to apply the
</I>&gt;<i>patch you provided in opening socket.
</I>
The code snippet was not supposed to be a proper &quot;patch&quot;, just an example
of code coded &quot;the old way&quot;. Personally i'm not sure wether supporting a
kernel that is not even supported by Alan Cox anymore (he passed the tree
off to a volounteer that will make the 2.0.38 patch and then it's done) is
a wise decision, especially with 2.4.XX just around the corner (at least,
that's what Linus keeps saying on the kernel mailing list. I know better
than to believe him of course :)
Either way at the moment i do not have neither a 2.0.XX kernel nor glibc
2.0 handy, but if you get it working on your system i would be willing to
integrate it in the codebase.

All this code will get killed when we integrate into the native build
anyway, so it actually hardly matters :)

&gt;&gt;<i> I fear that making a &quot;general&quot; unix ethhost.c would entail using libpcap
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and libnet to capture and transmit raw frames.
</I>&gt;<i>.. no,no... not a &quot;general unix&quot; ethhost.c but, at least, a &quot;general
</I>&gt;<i>linux&quot; one! I think that looking the source code of &quot;tcpdump&quot; or &quot;sniffer&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>could help us!
</I>
I based my code on that of a sniffer found in one of the phrack issues
(www.phrack.net). 
BTW, i hopped by the library today but Internetworking w/ TCP/IP Vol 1 was
already loaned out :(

Ranieri.
