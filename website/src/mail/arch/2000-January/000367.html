<PRE>What we call a class is important, critical when the alternative packages
are used in mostly-bytecode applications. Once a package has been used in
an application, we should not rename it.

I am also concerned with creating classes that work. My attempt to copy
source code from the Classpath Project in bulk has not been successful. I
was hoping that 90-95% of the code would compile and run. I hoped to add
all the classes and then remove the classes that gave me trouble. This is
taking far too long.

Today, I am taking a different approach. I'm going to add one class at a
time. In other words, I am going to approach this as if I wrote each class
by hand. Starting with a short list of classes from the Java 0 Platform, I
am adding them to the alt.* namespace along with brand new test programs.

Like extreme programming, all classes will be compiled without error each
day. Classes that have been compiled can be tested and used.

Where I might have used a class in java.util, I'll start using a class from
alt.platform0.util, alt.platform1.util, alt.platform2.util whenever I can.

Question: Why should I implement all three?

alt.util0.Enumeration,
alt.util1.Enumeration, and
alt.util2.Enumeration

Answer: The alt.* packages are future oriented. It is possible that each of
these classes might have different methods and fields. While Enumeration is
identical for the first three Java platforms, there is no guarantee that
Java 3, 4 and 5 Platforms will even implement a class called Enumeration.
Who knows what its methods and fields will be?
