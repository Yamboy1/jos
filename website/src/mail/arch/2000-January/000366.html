</I>
There are at least three products called &quot;AWT&quot;. It is most difficult to
undo this kind of mistake. I would like to think of them as &quot;AWT for Java 0
Platform&quot;, &quot;AWT for Java 1 Platform&quot; and &quot;AWT for Java 2 Platform&quot;.

Why do I think about &quot;peer&quot; as a subpackage of &quot;alt.awt2&quot;? Because each
implementation of &quot;peer&quot; is closely associated with a specific
implementation of &quot;AWT&quot;. Since each AWT has a different number of packages,
my proposal is this:

AWT for Java 0 Platform:
alt.awt0=java.awt
alt.awt0.image=java.awt.image
alt.awt0.peer=java.awt.peer

AWT for Java 1 Platform:
alt.awt1=java.awt
alt.awt1.datatransfer=java.awt.datatransfer
alt.awt1.event=java.awt.event
alt.awt1.image=java.awt.image
alt.awt1.peer=java.awt.peer
alt.awt1.print=java.awt.print

AWT for Java 2 Platform:
alt.awt2=java.awt
alt.awt2.datatransfer=java.awt.datatransfer
alt.awt2.event=java.awt.event
alt.awt2.image=java.awt.image
alt.awt2.peer=java.awt.peer
alt.awt2.print=java.awt.print
:<i>
</I>etc.

The alt.* packages are not intended to fix all namespace mistakes. You are
correct. &quot;alt.awt2.peer&quot; does not make sense to enlightened folks. If we
were dealing with a brand new design, I might have used something like this:

alt.datatransfer2=java.awt.datatransfer
alt.event2=java.awt.event
alt.image2=java.awt.image
alt.peer2=java.awt.peer
alt.print2=java.awt.print

Event-driven programs, for example, are not the exclusive domain of visual
applications. We know this from the event-driven device drivers for JOS.
Therefore, the event package should not have been tied exclusively to the AWT.

The print package is obviously non-visual (right?). Since AWT components
can be used for printing, AWT has itself become something where visual is
optional.

-----

Like you said earlier, we can't use &quot;2&quot; as a package name. And why not?
Because a javac tool refuses to compile any package in a directory called
&quot;2&quot;. I tried to compile a package called &quot;2&quot; to see what might happen. It
did not work at all. Package names, like other identifiers, must start with
a letter (A-Z, a-z) or an underscore.

My most-recently-used platform-map.ini file looks something like this:

[java2-map]
alt.applet2=java.applet
alt.awt2=java.awt
alt.awt2.datatransfer=java.awt.datatransfer
alt.awt2.event=java.awt.event
alt.awt2.image=java.awt.image
alt.awt2.peer=java.awt.peer
alt.awt2.print=java.awt.print
alt.beans2=java.beans
alt.beans2.beancontext=java.beans.beancontext
alt.beans2.editors=java.beans.editors
alt.beans2.info=java.beans.info
alt.io2=java.io
alt.io2.decode=java.io.decode
alt.io2.encode=java.io.encode
alt.lang2=java.lang
alt.lang2.ref=java.lang.ref
alt.lang2.reflect=java.lang.reflect
alt.locale2=java.locale
alt.math2=java.math
alt.net2=java.net
alt.security2=java.security
alt.security2.acl=java.security.acl
alt.security2.cert=java.security.cert
alt.security2.der=java.security.der
alt.security2.interfaces=java.security.interfaces
alt.security2.provider=java.security.provider
alt.security2.spec=java.security.spec
alt.security2.util=java.security.util
alt.sql2=java.sql
alt.text2=java.text
alt.util2=java.util

These classes seems to be part of the core:

java.lang.Object
java.lang.Class
java.lang.ClassLoader
java.lang.Throwable
java.lang.Exception
java.lang.RuntimeException

java.lang.String is part of the core because it is a final class. And yet,
it has changed in incompatible ways from one platform to the next.

We must not confuse &quot;important&quot; with &quot;necessary&quot;. How do we determine if a
class is part of the core or not? Is it possible to run a virtual machine
without it.

There is nothing inherent in a virtual machine that requires a network. The
java.net.* package is not required by a virtual machine; it is not part of
the true core. Just as a command line (CL) program might never use
java.awt, many programs might never use java.net. The java.net package is
important to us as network application programmers. It is not important to
a stand-alone application.

Let me put it another way. Sun Microsystems could have easily implemented a
network package in javax.net and distributed it with every Java Virtual
Machine. A program that needs Sun Microsystems' network package could have
used javax.net.

We can implement network packages in alt.net0, alt.net1 and alt.net2 and
distribute these packages with every virtual machine. Any program that
needs network support can use alt.net0, alt.net1 and alt.net2.
