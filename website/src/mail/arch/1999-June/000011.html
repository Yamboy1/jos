True, each application could use the registry classes, since they are
part of &quot;org.jos&quot; and not &quot;jos.*&quot; But if the applications are written
specifically for JOS, such as the system, the GUI managers, the system
applications (defrag tools, monitors, etc.), then these applications can
utilize a standard JOS registry - merely an instance of
org.jos.registry.RegistryServer.

&gt;<i> Do you have an ideas of what might be stored in the global registry?
</I>
Yes, actually, I started developing the registry because I had found out
that my own applications (non related to JOS) would naturally need to
use certain configuration files. I found the method of INI files in
Windows very disturbing, since they are slow and need access to the disk
hardware, and fragment the disk, etc. I also realized that some settings
are common, such as Look &amp; Feel preferences, custom commands, network
settings (such as suggested speed and buffering size and methods), etc.

I believe that JOS will also need a lot of these preferences, settings
and configuration information, and a neat place to do that is the
registry. Don't get me wrong, I call this API &quot;registry&quot; because it
began as a form of registry, but in reality, it is a structured,
tree-like, OO database, with hierarchies and data types and algorithms
for searching, replacing, recursion, etc. The API can be used in many
other ways, even in GUI managers (layers, etc.)

&gt;<i> In  a multi-user environment, can every user write anywhere in the
</I>&gt;<i> registry, or will you use ACLs to restrict this?
</I>
I can guarantee that access to things like [//system/config] will only
be accessible from system classes - i.e. jos.system.* or jos.fs.* etc.
This can easily be done with the Access Controller. I can also guarantee
that in a networked environment, CodeBase security will be good. IF, and
I stress *if* the JOS system is well implemented, then the system
classes will deny reading or writing to things like [//system/config]
unless the user is authorized to do so.

Since the RegistryServer is an abstract class, the implementation can
handle the security. For example, JOSRegistryServer extends
RegistryServer may use the JOSSecurityManager that contains Registry
policies and restrictions. As long as the system can detect the group
and name of the user, then access to the registry can be monitored.

Of course, the registry will use ACLs. The point is that I do not know
if these things should be in the registry itself, or in the policy file,
in the form of:

RegistryPermission (&quot;read, write, list&quot;, &quot;//system/config/entry&quot;);

I would suggest that the security be implemented in the registry, and it
be accessed in a similar way to JDBC, that is:

<A HREF="registry://localhost/system/config/entry?action=delete&user=jeeves&password=cafebabe">registry://localhost/system/config/entry?action=delete&amp;user=jeeves&amp;password=cafebabe</A>

This could possibly use SSL or PGP or whatever. If user &quot;jeeves&quot; is
authenticated with the password &quot;cafebabe&quot; then the ACL is checked
(possibly a second registry, as a private member of the
JOSRegistryServer), and user jeeves is either granted or denied action
&quot;delete&quot;. If the concern is the URL system, then a POST request can be
made. If firewalls are not of a problem (system could have access to
multiple hosts, but if the computer is a public terminal, maybe not...),
then a custom protocol could be used.

&gt;<i> Replication would be very useful for maintaining network configuration
</I>&gt;<i> across all computers in a network. However, network configuration data
</I>&gt;<i> is a broad category that could be partitioned into data managed by
</I>&gt;<i> individual network services. If for security reasons, it is desirable

</I>&gt;<i> to replicate each registry individually. Is it possible to group these
</I>&gt;<i> registries into one replication operation?
</I>
Well, the registry is merely a place to store information. If we deem
more appropriate to use dedicated replication services, then so be it.
But in many cases, having a standard and transparent mechanism for
replicating is useful. Like this:

Registry registry = (Registry)Naming.lookup(&quot;//localhost/registryserv&quot;);

Address local = new Address(&quot;//system/mirrors/dir/dir/&quot;);
Address remote = new Address(&quot;//otherdomain.org/regserve/dir/dir/&quot;);

registry.copy(remote, local, true);

Where Registry.copy(Address source, Address target, boolean overwrite);

&gt;<i> There may be more elegant was to achieve the same result.
</I>
True, since my replication is based on RMI and Object Serialization...
I am not planning, though, on creating custom protocols for replication,
or even direct access to the registry, at least not within the next few
months.

&gt;<i> Another point is that if the registry runs as a server, does each user
</I>&gt;<i> have to run their own server for their &quot;application preferences&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> registry?
</I>
In the same way many things in JOS should be, that is, servers. If not
servers, then Servlets. Hmm... FileSystemServlet, RegistryServlet,
sounds nice.

On a local system, you could do something like this:

RegistryServer registry = JOSSystem.getLocalRegistryServer();

On a remote, yes, you would have to use an RMI connection.

&gt;<i> Or does one server manage all the registries on the system?
</I>
I thought of making the server contain a Hashtable with multiple
registries, and I probably will. If I don't, you can still run many
servers in different RMI namespaces:

Naming.bind(&quot;SystemRegistry&quot;, systemRegistry);
Naming.bind(&quot;AppRegistry&quot;, appRegistry);
etc...

&gt;<i> The second approach would put less load on the system but raises more
</I>&gt;<i> security issues...
</I>
Indeed, unless each Registry is responsible for its security, and not
the server. The server could pass a &quot;RegistryServerContext&quot; to the
registry, and the registry can thus find out things about the user, his
domain, etc.

Just have in mind that this is only an experimental API, and is not by
any means done - I have not yet even implemented the RMI services! It
only works locally now (but everything works normally, only RMI is under
development).

&gt;<i> If you look in java.security.* and java.security.acl.* there are
</I>&gt;<i> concepts such as users, groups and ACLs. I just spent the weekend
</I>&gt;<i> writing implementations of these interfaces and sketching out a user
</I>&gt;<i> model and security model for JOS.
</I>
I would really like to see this model. I read a few books and article
about Java's security nitty gritty details, but have not yet spent
enough time (I am more involved in data types and algorithms currently,
that's why!) I am merely familiar with Permissions and Permission groups
and how to really implement a program that used custom permissions in
the access controller.

Do you think you could look into the registry security, or at least
brief me in how the JOS security model will be structured, so I can
blend in the registry? It would be nice for everything to use a unified
security mechanism (Yeah, right! So a single hole gets the entire
system! :)

&gt;<i> The security classes have not been checked in yet, and I will start a
</I>&gt;<i> discussion about various design issues before I commit them to CVS.
</I>
I'll be listening to the lists. :)
