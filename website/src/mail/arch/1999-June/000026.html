I know, I have done the same thing with my registry, just that I added
an implementation (Impl classes) and an interface (RegistryServer) which
do not affect the registry API at all (they could be missing from the
classpath and nothing would go wrong if using just the registry).

&gt;<i> In a few places, I made a point to demonstrate that a registry does

</I>
True, my registry is simply an OO structure. Unless you ask for it,
through the server, to be saved to a file (written to a Stream), it
remains transient. My registry also has the ability to hold
non-serializable or transient items, so all nodes and leafs in the
registry tree have the methods:

isValid();
isSerializable();

&gt;<i> I also made a point to demonstrate that a registry, when stored, may
</I>&gt;<i> be stored by another process (like a registry service), another
</I>&gt;<i> machine (like a registry server).
</I>
This is done. Of course, it is accomplished only via RMI, which is
something to debate about...

&gt;<i> When a registry needs to be stored, it can be stored in a wide variety
</I>&gt;<i> of different file formats, from .conf to XML.
</I>
There was an idea of having Transformation algorithms as an API in JOS.
This way, you feed the engine bytes, and it transforms it to another
format, such as XML. This API is not ready yet, so up to now I have only
added a method in the registry like this:

toXMLString();

which really returns a String object, not an XML Document (still waiting
for Sun's official implementation of XML in javax.xml.*) and cannot
interpret XML registries yet.

&gt;<i> &gt;Also, I would not suggest the usage of primitive types.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Without primative types, Java would not have been possible. In theory,
</I>&gt;<i> Java should have made everything an object. Without primative types, a

</I>
True, but I think the overhead for creating Float and Blob objects less
compared to the amount of processing required to handle different data
types. Up to now, the registry only recognizes type Object, which is
precisely what List, Vector, Hashtable, etc. accept...

&gt;<i> Maybe what you want is an object store. You must be talking about a
</I>&gt;<i> high level registry. But a high level registry isn't a registry at
</I>&gt;<i> all. That would be...an object store.
</I>
OK :)

Basically, I am making an inverted tree that stores objects, and can
manipulate these objects by retrieving them, replacing them, replicating
them, etc.

&gt;<i> &gt;That ONLY JOS-specific applications can use these classes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How is it that 100% Pure Java classes created by the JOS Project will
</I>&gt;<i> only work in the JOS JVM? Certainly, you've been running your registry
</I>&gt;<i> in a non-JOS JVM.
</I>
No, no, no... I mean that if every object in the Java API is changed to
be a registry, then this is not a 100% Java API.

I am running the registry in JDK 1.2 final.

&gt;<i> JOS-specific applications might be expected to use the registry API.
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, it might be a built-in part of the Process object where JOS
</I>&gt;<i> applications live.
</I>
Or, more simply, could just be an RMI server. But true, having a method
like this would be useful:

JOSSystem.getRegistry();

&gt;<i> The JOS Project is pioneering some of the APIs that may become the
</I>&gt;<i> next generation of industry standards. If the JOS registry API is
</I>&gt;<i> really, really great, it won't take much for Sun Microsystems to
</I>&gt;<i> provide a registry API as a built-in part of Java 3 or 4.
</I>
Let's cross our fingers then! :)

&gt;<i> My own motivation for working on the registry API is because I need to
</I>&gt;<i> use it now. I have current products held up because they have no
</I>&gt;<i> registry. I am enthusiastic about shipping a registry compatible with
</I>&gt;<i> the JOS Registry API along with each product I build. A product suite
</I>&gt;<i> only has to install a registry once. All of the products are able to
</I>&gt;<i> share the same registry through a well-known API.
</I>
Well, since sharing is a keyword, security must be implemented first...

&gt;<i> My products run on some machines where there is no TCP/IP stack. They
</I>&gt;<i> have no network at all. This is why RMI and CORBA are not an option. I
</I>&gt;<i> just want a registry, and that's all.
</I>
The org.jos.registry.RegistryServer class extends UnicastRemoteObject
and implements org.jos.registry.Server that extends java.rmi.Remote.

You can simply create a local RegistryServer class and use it, without
binding through an RMI registry. If your server and client is in the
same process, you won't need network at all.

&gt;<i> I have downloaded the Registry.jar. Isn't a jar just like a zip file?
</I>&gt;<i> I might be able to unzip it, right?
</I>
Yup, Jar files use the ZIP inflator plus they add a cute manifest file.
