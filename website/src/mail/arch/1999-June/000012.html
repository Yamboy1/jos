</I>
Although applications written specifically for JOS wouldn't
automatically use the global registry. For example GUI managers would
still use per user registries so that each user can configure the GUI
manager how they want. But the GUI manager could read a subset of its
configuration from a global registry if it makes sense to.

&gt;<i> &gt; Do you have an ideas of what might be stored in the global registry?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, actually, I started developing the registry because I had found out
</I>&gt;<i> that my own applications (non related to JOS) would naturally need to
</I>&gt;<i> use certain configuration files. I found the method of INI files in
</I>&gt;<i> Windows very disturbing, since they are slow and need access to the disk
</I>&gt;<i> hardware, and fragment the disk, etc. I also realized that some settings
</I>&gt;<i> are common, such as Look &amp; Feel preferences, custom commands, network
</I>&gt;<i> settings (such as suggested speed and buffering size and methods), etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that JOS will also need a lot of these preferences, settings
</I>&gt;<i> and configuration information, and a neat place to do that is the
</I>&gt;<i> registry. Don't get me wrong, I call this API &quot;registry&quot; because it
</I>&gt;<i> began as a form of registry, but in reality, it is a structured,
</I>&gt;<i> tree-like, OO database, with hierarchies and data types and algorithms
</I>&gt;<i> for searching, replacing, recursion, etc. The API can be used in many
</I>&gt;<i> other ways, even in GUI managers (layers, etc.)
</I>
I see the advantage of handling configuration data in a more structured
way. My only concern has been that a single registry that is used by
multiple applications can possibly grow out of control. There at least
needs to be a way to clearly see what applications depend on what parts
of the registry, and which data is shared between multiple applications.

&gt;<i> Of course, the registry will use ACLs. The point is that I do not know
</I>&gt;<i> if these things should be in the registry itself, or in the policy file,
</I>&gt;<i> in the form of:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> RegistryPermission (&quot;read, write, list&quot;, &quot;//system/config/entry&quot;);
</I>
Need there be a difference between &quot;read&quot; and &quot;list&quot;? Also, don't forget
to specify who the permission is granted to.

&gt;<i> Well, the registry is merely a place to store information. If we deem
</I>&gt;<i> more appropriate to use dedicated replication services, then so be it.
</I>
Ok.

&gt;<i> &gt; Another point is that if the registry runs as a server, does each user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to run their own server for their &quot;application preferences&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; registry?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the same way many things in JOS should be, that is, servers. If not
</I>&gt;<i> servers, then Servlets. Hmm... FileSystemServlet, RegistryServlet,
</I>&gt;<i> sounds nice.
</I>
On a system with 400 users that might bring a large overhead. I do
believe that each repository instance should work like a server so that
read/writes are synchronized across multiple clients, but if the server
runs in a different address space, this will incur a performance penalty
of having to use Sockets to talk to it.

If each application has its own registry then the registry can live in
the same address space. But I don't know if a registry for each
application is a good idea. I hope that JOS can provide a more efficient
IPC mechanism that effectively allows a client to talk to a server on
the same machine as though it were in the same address space. Basically,
if you are using RMI, then you could change the IPC mechanism to this
more efficient mechanism without the client knowing.

Then there is the issue of how long should the server be running (as a
thread)? UNIX uses the concept of a super-server that fires up server
processes only when they are needed. So for example, the ftp server is
not running and consuming resources the whole time.

&gt;<i> Do you think you could look into the registry security, or at least
</I>&gt;<i> brief me in how the JOS security model will be structured, so I can
</I>&gt;<i> blend in the registry?
</I>
The model that I'm working on is not necessarily &quot;the&quot; model, but I will
try to make it meet the requirements we have at this point in time. The
requirements of your registry will obviously help shape how security is
modelled.

&gt;<i> It would be nice for everything to use a unified
</I>&gt;<i> security mechanism (Yeah, right! So a single hole gets the entire
</I>&gt;<i> system! :)
</I>
Having a unified security mechanism would improve security IMHO. Even
though a single hole gets the entire system, a single security system
means a simpler security system, and the simpler it is, the more robust
it is likely to be.
