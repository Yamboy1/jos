</I>
If we have a common API for GUI managers, such as
&quot;jos.ui.gui.GUIManager&quot; which would be extended, then the registry could
contain automatic settings, global GUI manager settings, etc. If I also
implement linking in the registry, just as symbolic links in a FS, then
this could prove to be a space/time saver indeed...

&gt;<i> I see the advantage of handling configuration data in a more structured
</I>&gt;<i> way. My only concern has been that a single registry that is used by
</I>&gt;<i> multiple applications can possibly grow out of control. There at least
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be a way to clearly see what applications depend on what parts
</I>&gt;<i> of the registry, and which data is shared between multiple applications.
</I>
I was thinking of implementing quota-based handling of the registry,
that is, specific Threads could use more &quot;time&quot; of the registry, such as
security and system threads, and other threads (such as screen savers or
user applications) use less time. Or, you could count the size each
application is using. I know how to measure the time of a thread, but
how would you measure the size of data? Is the only way to serialize it
and count the bytes, or is there a simpler way?

Anyway, I think that the registry could be split up into sections, such
as hives for instance, each one in its own space, possibly even
different instances. This way, you can have a System, Security, JOS, and
User registry. We can guarantee that all but the User registries remain
cool, and I suppose that if the User registry goes out of hand, deleting
parts of it would not even be dangerous for the system...

&gt;<i> &gt; RegistryPermission (&quot;read, write, list&quot;, &quot;//system/config/entry&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Need there be a difference between &quot;read&quot; and &quot;list&quot;? Also, don't forget
</I>&gt;<i> to specify who the permission is granted to.
</I>
Well, that was just a quick example. Yeah, I suppose &quot;read&quot; permission
on a Directory of the registry means listEntries() too...

&gt;<i> &gt; In the same way many things in JOS should be, that is, servers. If not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; servers, then Servlets. Hmm... FileSystemServlet, RegistryServlet,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sounds nice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On a system with 400 users that might bring a large overhead. I do
</I>&gt;<i> believe that each repository instance should work like a server so that
</I>&gt;<i> read/writes are synchronized across multiple clients, but if the server
</I>&gt;<i> runs in a different address space, this will incur a performance penalty
</I>&gt;<i> of having to use Sockets to talk to it.
</I>
How does RMI solve this, if at all? I was assuming that the only problem
with multiple users on an RMI connection would be speed decrease. Do you
think that we should implement the server in such a way that it responds
just like a HTTP server, with Thread pools, priorities, timeouts etc.?

&gt;<i> If each application has its own registry then the registry can live in
</I>&gt;<i> the same address space. But I don't know if a registry for each
</I>&gt;<i> application is a good idea.
</I>
Not really, because that would mean separate files, precisely what I
want to avoid by creating a unified config repository... If everything
is kept in the same place, then it would not make a difference if simply
different subdirectories in the registry were used. The searching
algorithm takes (n Theta / 4) anyhow, in the root or near root levels,
this is not a great performance concern. I think.

&gt;<i> Then there is the issue of how long should the server be running (as a
</I>&gt;<i> thread)? UNIX uses the concept of a super-server that fires up server
</I>&gt;<i> processes only when they are needed. So for example, the ftp server is
</I>&gt;<i> not running and consuming resources the whole time.
</I>
Would not the registry, though, be VERY frequently used? Maybe the
overhead for creating and starting servers is too much, compared to the
little time the registry is not used. I would propose something else, a
registry cache. Many entries don't really have to be changed that often,
so they could be kept in a cache. Say, a Hashtable with 100 capacity, or
whatever. Would work like this:

Registry registry = (Registry)Naming.llokup(&quot;RegistryServe&quot;);
Address address = new Address(&quot;//system/info/user.name&quot;);
registry.getCached(address);

The registry can look for the entry in the cache first, then return it.
If someone changes (updates) the real entry, then the cache is either
nullified or updated (depending on preferences). The cache can have a
timeout. It can displace old items, or even better, less used items
(this would mean a little extra statistical processing though). Always
depending on preferences.

Opinions?

&gt;<i> The model that I'm working on is not necessarily &quot;the&quot; model, but I will
</I>&gt;<i> try to make it meet the requirements we have at this point in time. The
</I>&gt;<i> requirements of your registry will obviously help shape how security is
</I>&gt;<i> modelled.
</I>
Well, I guess I would want the following types of access:

Entry

read, write (delete implied), change security options

Directory

read, write, read entries, read subdirectories, create subdirectory,
create entry, change security options


The above because the Directory contains a default Entry, so it has a
name and value.


&gt;<i> Having a unified security mechanism would improve security IMHO. Even
</I>&gt;<i> though a single hole gets the entire system, a single security system
</I>&gt;<i> means a simpler security system, and the simpler it is, the more robust
</I>&gt;<i> it is likely to be.
</I>
True. Do you think the registry should also have a mechanism for
handling GuardedObjects and such seamlessly for the user? That is, for
security while storing or retransmitting the registry?
