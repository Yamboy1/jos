<PRE>Hello

I'm now looking for input and help on the design and documentation of 
the JOS Kernel Interface.  This interface defines the services 
provided by the kernel to the rest of the system.

You can find the current interface header files at 
&lt;URL:<A HREF="http://jos.org/cvsweb.cgi/jos/interfaces/kernel/">http://jos.org/cvsweb.cgi/jos/interfaces/kernel/</A>&gt;.

I have included the a draft of the documentation for ktype.h header 
file (Data Type Interface).  What I need now is pieces I have missed, 
like should there be a boolean data type or a error value defined?  
Also what about kfunction macro, which all kernel functions would 
declare, this would allow for kernel functions to be inlined?

Comments and volunteers?

Data Type Interface

This interface defines most of the data types and values used 
throughout the kernel interface.  Some of these data types have 
defined sizes set by the kernel interface, and others are platform 
specific.  

These data types and values are defined in the 'ktype.h' header file.
Note: To allow the 'ktype.h' header file to be shared by all 
implementations of the kernel interface, the header file includes the 
'kernel_type.h' header file from the kernel implementation.  It is 
this file which actually defines all the data types and values.  

Data types table:

Name       Size                Type
----       ----                ----
kint       platform specific   signed two's complement integer
kint8      8 bits              signed two's complement integer
kint16     16 bits             signed two's complement integer
kint32     32 bits             signed two's complement integer
kint64     64 bits             signed two's complement integer
kuint      platform specific   unsigned integer
kuint8     8 bits              unsigned integer
kuint16    16 bits             unsigned integer
kuint32    32 bits             unsigned integer
kuint64    64 bits             unsigned integer
kfloat     platfrom specific   IEEE 754 floating point number
kfloat32   32 bits             IEEE 754 floating point number
kfloat64   64 bits             IEEE 754 floating point number
khandle    platform specific   kernel specific

Notes:
 * The size in bits of a platform specific integer data type is
   greater than or equal to the size in bits of a pointer on that
   platform.
 * The size in bits of a platform specific floating point number data
   type is greater than or equal to the size in bits of the kfloat64
   data type.
 * The khandle data type is kernel implementation specific.  The only
   operation premitted on this data type outside of the kernel
   implementation is the printing of it's value for debugging
   propocess.  When it's value is being printed it should be treated
   as an unsigned integer.

There are also three data values defined by this interface, ktrue,
kfalse, and knull.

Data values table:

Name       Value
----       -----
ktrue      value when an expression elevates as true
kfalse     value when an expression elevates as false
knull      value of a null pointer
