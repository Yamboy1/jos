<PRE>I've always liked the idea of a virtual registry namespace, where depending
on the user and application (and maybe even process), different namespaces
are mapped to the registry.  Let me explain in an example:

User A has his hotkey preferences, but User B likes to use the system
default preferences.  They both use application C, which is JOS registry
aware.  Application C checks out (for example)
&quot;//apps/com/JoeBlowInc/C/Hotkeys&quot; to get the default hotkey mappings.  The
registry performs a virtual mapping for User A to map &quot;//usr/A/C/HotKeys&quot;
over the app default.

In this manner the user/application can override system defaults, but the
changes are saved to a virtually mapped space, so that the real defaults are
not altered.

&gt;&gt;<i> Having a unified security mechanism would improve security IMHO. Even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though a single hole gets the entire system, a single security system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> means a simpler security system, and the simpler it is, the more robust
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it is likely to be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>True. Do you think the registry should also have a mechanism for
</I>&gt;<i>handling GuardedObjects and such seamlessly for the user? That is, for
</I>&gt;<i>security while storing or retransmitting the registry?
</I>

It sounds like what is needed is a way to send user/application information
to the RMI server for security checking.  This would also aid with the
virtual mapping described above.  Could this be done in the skeleton / stub
code, so that &quot;registry login&quot; is performed once when requesting the stub?
There may be security holes here, but I'm not sure.
