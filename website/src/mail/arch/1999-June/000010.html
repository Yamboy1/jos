I understand how the registry itself works, but I do not know the
typical ways in which JOS can make use of a registry. Hopefully people
can make suggestions here on the arch list.

As a UNIX user, I am not familiar with the Windows registry. But I can
see a similarity between the registry and UNIX dot-rc files (which store
user preferences for applications). I do see the advantage in having a
more organised system of storing per user preferences - perhaps each
user can have their own &quot;application preferences&quot; registry.

&gt;<i> If the JOS system decides to use a
</I>&gt;<i> central registry (instead of a temp directory), then applications
</I>&gt;<i> written for JOS will probably be able to write to a global registry.
</I>
Do you have an ideas of what might be stored in the global registry? In
a multi-user environment, can every user write anywhere in the registry,
or will you use ACLs to restrict this?

&gt;<i> The
</I>&gt;<i> good thing with the registry is that it runs as a server, and it also
</I>&gt;<i> has replication capabilities (working on them now), which means that it
</I>&gt;<i> assists in the development of a truly distributed JOS system.
</I>
Replication would be very useful for maintaining network configuration
across all computers in a network. However, network configuration data
is a broad category that could be partitioned into data managed by
individual network services. If for security reasons, it is desirable to
run these network services under different user spaces (unlike UNIX
where many services run as root), it may also be desirable to have a
different registry for each network service, and then you would have to
replicate each registry individually. Is it possible to group these
registries into one replication operation?

There may be more elegant was to achieve the same result.

Another point is that if the registry runs as a server, does each user
have to run their own server for their &quot;application preferences&quot;
registry? Or does one server manage all the registries on the system?
The second approach would put less load on the system but raises more
security issues... which brings us to:

&gt;<i> I will also start working on the security of the registry, which will
</I>&gt;<i> work in a way similar to Java's security overall - that is, a CodeBase
</I>&gt;<i> object is the group, a Class is the user, etc.
</I>
If you look in java.security.* and java.security.acl.* there are
concepts such as users, groups and ACLs. I just spent the weekend
writing implementations of these interfaces and sketching out a user
model and security model for JOS. This came about because my ftp server
(org.jos.services.ftp.server) and Peter Schuller's pop server
(org.jos.services.pop.server) require a user model to support user
accounts, user authentication and user authorization. These are
available from CVS in the jos/library module.

The security classes have not been checked in yet, and I will start a
discussion about various design issues before I commit them to CVS.
