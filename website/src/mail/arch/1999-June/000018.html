That's like a token server where you must obtain a token to perform
operations on the registry. The token has a lifetime and possibly other
things. It's up to you how you make use of the token. I don't know how
useful this would be.

&gt;<i> Anyway, I think that the registry could be split up into sections, such
</I>&gt;<i> as hives for instance, each one in its own space, possibly even
</I>&gt;<i> different instances. This way, you can have a System, Security, JOS, and
</I>&gt;<i> User registry. We can guarantee that all but the User registries remain
</I>&gt;<i> cool, and I suppose that if the User registry goes out of hand, deleting
</I>&gt;<i> parts of it would not even be dangerous for the system...
</I>
Yes, but it would still be nice to know which parts of the registry
belong to which applications and which parts of the registry are shared
between a number of applications. At least, this is something we should
think about in the future.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In the same way many things in JOS should be, that is, servers. If not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; servers, then Servlets. Hmm... FileSystemServlet, RegistryServlet,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sounds nice.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On a system with 400 users that might bring a large overhead. I do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; believe that each repository instance should work like a server so that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; read/writes are synchronized across multiple clients, but if the server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; runs in a different address space, this will incur a performance penalty
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of having to use Sockets to talk to it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How does RMI solve this, if at all? I was assuming that the only problem

</I>
Well, perhaps it is a better idea to run just one server :-) My initial
security concerns are starting to go away now that I have put some more
thought into how JOS might handle security (I will post my research to
the list RSN).

&gt;<i> Do you
</I>&gt;<i> think that we should implement the server in such a way that it responds
</I>&gt;<i> just like a HTTP server, with Thread pools, priorities, timeouts etc.?
</I>
Possibly. Ideally, applications should not have to worry about thread
pools. JOS should try to be efficient enough for it not to matter.

&gt;<i> &gt; Then there is the issue of how long should the server be running (as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thread)? UNIX uses the concept of a super-server that fires up server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; processes only when they are needed. So for example, the ftp server is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not running and consuming resources the whole time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would not the registry, though, be VERY frequently used? Maybe the
</I>&gt;<i> overhead for creating and starting servers is too much, compared to the
</I>&gt;<i> little time the registry is not used.
</I>
If there is only one registry server that manages all registries, yes it
would be frequently used. I am starting to think this is the best way to
do it anyhow.

&gt;<i> I would propose something else, a
</I>&gt;<i> registry cache.
</I>&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;<i> Opinions?
</I>
If the cache is on the client side, it would improve performance a lot.
If it is on the server side, it won't improve performance much.

&gt;<i> Well, I guess I would want the following types of access:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Entry
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> read, write (delete implied), change security options
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Directory
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> read, write, read entries, read subdirectories, create subdirectory,
</I>&gt;<i> create entry, change security options
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The above because the Directory contains a default Entry, so it has a
</I>&gt;<i> name and value.
</I>
Types of access is a generic concept that is supported in JDK 1.1, so
yes you can have all of those types of access. I would suggest you have
a look at the javadoc for the java.security.acl package in JDK 1.1 (JDK
1.2 has some additional security stuff which we can't make use of unless
we commit to using JDK 1.2). The documentation explains how you can
define and grant types of access to individual users and groups.

&gt;<i> &gt; Having a unified security mechanism would improve security IMHO. Even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; though a single hole gets the entire system, a single security system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; means a simpler security system, and the simpler it is, the more robust
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is likely to be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> True. Do you think the registry should also have a mechanism for
</I>&gt;<i> handling GuardedObjects and such seamlessly for the user? That is, for
</I>&gt;<i> security while storing or retransmitting the registry?
</I>
GuardedObject is a new class in JDK 1.2. I haven't found a need for them
in my model yet, but if I end up needing them, I can invent a similar
class that works with JDK 1.1.
