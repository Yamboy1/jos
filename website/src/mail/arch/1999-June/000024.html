<PRE>As architects, we must look ahead. JOS must support all fifteen versions of
Java. JOS is expected to have a shelf life of ten to fifteen years, right?
Over the next fifteen years, Sun Microsystems will likely create fifteen
versions of Java at a rate of one per year. We can look forward to Java 3,
Java 4, Java 5, and beyond.

This needs to be discussed again. Many programmers have written good Java
applications with JDK 1.1. These applications aren't going to be ported
anytime soon to JDK 1.2.

We must exclude no one. History has shown that any OS based on a premise of
exclusion dies. How can we decide who to exclude? Should we exclude all
those actually writing JDK 1.1? or all those potentially writing JDK 1.2?

Over the next fifteen years, Sun is likely to create 15 more JDKs (or SDKs)
for different Java platforms. Each will be annoyingly incompatible with its
predecessor. Sun has pat answers for why incompatibility is necessary, and
even important, when it is not.

The impact of compatibility on JOS, and any big idea like JOS, is
tremendous. If JOS must always use the latest version of the JDK, it will
never be finished!!! We would spend more time re-writing, re-testing,
re-designing our code that building an OS that works.

My technical proposal is this. We must make JOS an operating system that is
version independent. A good OS is independent. A great OS is as independent
as possible. In the relationship between JOS and a JVM, JOS uses a JVM. JOS
uses a JVM to run JOS services.

The purpose of JOS is to minimize the virtual in Java virtual machine. It
is only an academic exercise to eliminate the virtual completely. Who
really needs it? By limiting JOS to one version of Java makes JOS
impossible to build for the future.

Since most of the JOS services will be written to run inside a JVM, all of
the unnecessary bloat of using a foreign OS will be eliminated. Isn't that
primarily what we're looking for?

There are technical solutions to these versioning issues. For example, JOS
should have a JVM API shared among all implementations of a JOS JVM. Like
pluggable modules in Linux, the JVM should be a pluggable module in JOS.
JOS should use a pluggable JOS JVM. Each person can have any JVM they want.

And to take this one more step, the architecture for JOS must be oriented
toward the inevidable future. Sun Microsystems will change their mind
again. JOS must still remain stable. When Java 4 comes out, I must be able
to run _both_ Java 3 and Java 4 on a single machine.

As an architect, I must look ahead. I should be able to partition my
computer resources (CPU/RAM) to run both a Java 3 and Java 4 JVM at the
same time. There should be inter-JVM communication through a TCP/IP stack.

We can save on an important resource (like RAM) because there is only a
&quot;few&quot; JVMs running on a machine. We will build most of the JOS services to
run completely inside a single primary JVM. The only program a JOS kernel
should run is a JVM.

Minimizing the virtual in Java virtual machine is a difficult thing to do.
The rewards are great. The JOS platform can be finely tuned to run Java
applications. It can provide a must better environment than any other
operating system.
