We can be as backwards compatible as Sun is, with JDK1.2... Personally,
I have never had trouble running a JDK 1.1 compliant app in my 1.2 VM...
My proposal is to use JDK 1.2 for the OS, since with 1.2 many things are
easier, better, faster, etc. *Naturally* apps written for 1.1 will run.
The only thing that would be a concern is that apps written specifically
for JOS must be thus 1.2, but since these don't exist yet, there really
is no problem!

Of course, we should always have in mind that we can stick to the
standard API, which is not likely to change (mainly features are added
from version to version), and the users can simply download a new JDK
and replace the old rt.jar file in the JOS lib directory...

Amen   :)
