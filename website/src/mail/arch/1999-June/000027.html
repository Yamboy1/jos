Yes. Permissions granted to a user always override permissions granted
by groups to which that user belongs.

If a group is denied permission X but a particular user in that group is
granted permission X, the result is that the user is granted the
permission.

Conversely, if a user is denied permission X, but a group to which that
user belongs grants the same permission, the user will still be denied
permission X.

Of course, if a user is neither granted nor denied permission X, but a
group to which the user belongs is granted the permission, the user will
be granted that permission.

The algorithm is:

granted permissions = (u1 + (g1 - u2)) - (u2 + (g2 - u1))

where:

u1 = permissions granted to user
u2 = permissions denied to user
g1 = permissions granted to groups containing user
g2 = permissions denied to groups containing user
