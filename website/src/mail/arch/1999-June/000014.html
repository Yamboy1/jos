With CORBA it is possible in some cases to use direct object-to-object
communication within the same address space ie. without using Sockets
(if the ORB supports it). I don't know if RMI has the flexibility to
support this but if someone ever writes a clone of RMI, it should be
possible to add this functionality without changing RMI's public API.

This is more efficient than writing a SocketImpl, because a SocketImpl
still must serialize objects and method invocations, then de-serialize
them for each invocation. Having a SharedMemorySocketImpl may still be
useful though. And, of course, it's not like we will have a free RMI
clone to hack any time soon...

</I>
I suspect that the JOS window manager will need an efficient IPC
mechanism, preferably shared memory. This is because a window will have
a reference to its parent window which may be in a separate process. It
will be hard to work out a safe way to implement this.
