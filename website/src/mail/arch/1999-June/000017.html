</I>
This is included in my released API, I have not yet implemented it
though (the *Impl.class files). The idea was that there is not only a
special case mapping, but a global mapping too. Example:


Address address1 = new Address(&quot;//system/config/&quot;);
Address address2 = new Address(&quot;/config/&quot;);


As you can see, address2 starts with a single slash. A double slash
indicates root, so if the default directory were &quot;//system/&quot; then it
would point to the same address as address1.

Of course, you can have a unique default directory for each application,
or better yet, for every use. Such as, server.setDefault(address); and
then server.get(address_virtual);

Although this is a bit different than what you suggest, it could serve
the purpose.

Big question: should the registry be able to handle this, or should each
app do it on its own. I would propose the second, because if the
registry does this, it may need an awful lot of overhead to store many
things...

&gt;<i> It sounds like what is needed is a way to send user/application information
</I>&gt;<i> to the RMI server for security checking.  This would also aid with the
</I>&gt;<i> virtual mapping described above.  Could this be done in the skeleton / stub
</I>&gt;<i> code, so that &quot;registry login&quot; is performed once when requesting the stub?
</I>&gt;<i> There may be security holes here, but I'm not sure.
</I>
I honestly have no idea...
