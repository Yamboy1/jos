<PRE>In my search for the driver/configuration/etc. directory, I have come across
several designs, but none of which are really satisfactory.

Here's my current wish-list for such a directory:
   1. Able to store Java objects with a name-object binding
   2. Names are referenced in a tree-like structure (ala Unix path
       names, or something similar)
   3. Each Entry (a bounded Java object) can have a set of attributes,
       which are themselves objects.
   4. Able to search the directory by several keys:
          a. Exact Name
          b. wild-card name (ala Unix again)
          c. object class (ala Jini)
          d. attributes
   5. Each entry has the option to be persistent, remote, both, or neither.
       This would specify which objects can be remotely downloaded,
       and saved for reloading on future reboots and directory restores..
   6. The base directory class is an interface, so any number of
       implementations can be made compatible.
   7. Probably an event system to announce new or removed entries, or
changes
       in entries' object or attributes.

I envision the directory to replace the classic idea of a Kernel API with a
configurable framework.  Sure, the other &quot;kernel&quot; parts will have their API
being static (such as the direct hardware access and process features),
since these are the built-in basic operations.  I also see the directory
having several &quot;static&quot; entries which act as gateways between the Java
&quot;static&quot; APIs (core, Java Media, whatever), and these entries are then tied
to the directory's other entries.

To support this framework idea, the middle-tier in the architecture would
need methods to change its directory entry references, and possibly listen
to the directory events for changes in its referenced entries.

For the &quot;static&quot; gateways, we would need to define interfaces for each part,
and implement, at a minimum, an adapter object which accepts all calls but
does nothing.

In this way a system architecture can be user-defined.  We would only supply
(as the kernel) several foundation utilities to make it possible.  And even
these kernel utilities are configurable with the right interfaces.

Just to show that this isn't all wish with no thought, here are some example
architectures a system architect could create:

1. A Plain-Jane architecture with nothing fancy. Drivers would be registered
in the directory, then the basic layers are added on these (file system to
link the disk drivers together, protocol stacks built on the network
drivers, and so on).  Then the &quot;static&quot; entries are assigned to the entry
points for these layers (java.io.File is linked to &quot;/static/java/io/File&quot;
for File I/O, java.net.Socket is linked to &quot;/static/java/io/TCPIPSocket&quot;,
and so on).  After this initial setup, each application only knows about the
Java API and acts as if it is in a standard jvm.

2. A research group works with per-process architecture. They design the
directory interface so that each process inherits a copy of the directory,
which can be configured such that each process can make its directory
optimized for its own task, without affecting the parent directories.  Each
process spawns off a configuration task which restructures the directory,
adding its own entries to optimize the to-driver layers.

3. A network computer sets up the directory so that it directly references a
Jini lookup server on the network.  All directory calls would be translated
into Jini remote requests and calls, and all located drivers would be RMI
stubs.
