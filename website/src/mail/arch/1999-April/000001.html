<PRE>I moved this discussion over from <A HREF="mailto:kernel@jos.org">kernel@jos.org</A>, since it pertains more to the
architecture than kernel.

It may seem like I'm advocating JavaOS here (I'm not), but I've read and somewhat
understood its architecture, so I'll write it here for your amusement.

It seems like JavaOS's event system allows for an event to be registered, event
announcers to be registered, and event listeners to be registered as well.
Announcers can opt to be the sole announcer for an event, and same with
listeners.  When registering an event, it is declaired whether the event is
generated asynchronously or synchronously.  Sync events go out on the same thread
from which they were announced/fired.  Async events are issued in a dedicated
event thread, separate from the announce thread.

Instead of the standard &quot;addXxxxListener&quot; call, it needs to be generic enough to
allow any type of event to be registered.  So it accepts something like a business
card which describes the event and which method is called to listen.  Events
themselves would need to be clonable so that each event listener can receive an
independent copy of the event.

The system is process independent (not that JavaOS even has processes), since it
distributes system-wide events like key-press.  It can be optionally extended to
allow for network-distributable events, and I assume can also be extended to
support other event systems such as Jini's distributed events (that wouldn't be
too tough).

So our KeyboardDriver would register itself with the GlobalEventSystem as a
KeyEvent announcer (but not as the only announcer - lets say that the system can
have a telnet connection from outside register itself as a KeyEvent announcer as
well, even though it could wreck havok).  The shell (used here to mean the primary
classes in charge of threading and process forking for the whole OS) would
register itself as the sole KeyListener.  Then if anyone else wants to listen to
the events, they must register through the shell: any registration as a
KeyListener in the GlobalEventSystem would throw an exception.  The shell's
listener would distribute the KeyEvents to its registered listeners depending on
who has the current focus.

In this way we can encapsulate all the event distributing in one place, and keep
it process/thread independent.
