<PRE>I have some comments, more related to user directory design (like the Linux
FileSystem Hierachy Standard). This is actually rather unrelated to the
kernel. Sorry if it is irrelevant.

Here I use slashes to represent directory boundaries.

Definitions:
Dynamic Classpath A classpath that is searched only after the &quot;static
   classpath&quot; is exhausted

=== Directory Structure/User Experience ===
The Directory Structure (DS) should look like this:
/user   /* Linked to the user's home directory, or (if it is a
   single-user machine) a directory by itself */

/user/classes  // [Write-only?] these are accesible through the
/user/classes/jar // /classes-hierachy.
/user/classes/exec // (Some form of RAID.)

/user/system  /* All the stuff in /system that the user has access
   to. Perhaps /system should be executable-only?
   This should be represented in a simplefied manner.
   (In Linux, executable on directories mean that you
   can see what's in them.) */

/classes  /* Plain-vanilla Java application classes, part of the
   CLASSPATH (like /classes/org/jos/Hello.class) */

/classes/jar  /* All JAR files in this are path of the dynamic
   classpath. */

/classes/exec  /* Only contains executable JAR files that can be
   executed as if they were normal class files in the
   user environment. */

/jos   /* Everything in jos.*, and stuff like JVM and
   kernel images. */

/system   /* Everything system-related, including devices.
   So we could have stuff like:
   user.system.Audio =&gt;
   system.local.devices.Audio =&gt;
   jos.device.audio.SoundBlaster16 =&gt;
   system.local.isa.slot2 */
=== END. ===

=== User Experience ===
This is just a little fictional shell session (inspired by how I
wanted Linux/bash to be) (comments are with '#' like bash):

Welcome to JOS, Guan Yang. The date is 1 January 2000.

/user$ dir  # jos.command.dir; /user =&gt; /users/guan
[classes] [system] [Work]  [Home Computer] [Fun]
[source]
/user$ cd system # jos.command.cd
/user/system$ dir
[devices] [network] [computer] [jini]  [environment]
/user/system$ cd devices
/user/system$ dir # abridged
Audio  Video  ...
/user/system$ copy /user/fun/jossong.au Audio
JOSplayer: Playing /user/fun/jossong.au on /user/system/devices/Audio...
End.
# JOSplayer is &quot;assigned&quot; to /user/system/devices/Audio
/user/system$ adduser guan2 # Interactive call of jos.command.adduser
You do not have access to add users. Do you wish to enter password? (Y/N) y
Supervisor password: *********
User guan2 added.
/user/system$ exec adduser guan3 # Non-interactive call of
jos.command.adduser
/user/system$ checkmesg # Check messages
Messages: 1
jos.command.exec Password required for task add users
   (jos.command.adduser guan3)
   Supervisor password was not in key library.
/user/system$ keylib addkey supervisor password # add a new key to the key \
library; the key is generated from password &quot;password&quot;
/user/system$ exec adduser guan4 # Non-interactive call
/user/system$ checkmesg
Messages: 1
jos.command.exec Password required for task addusers
   (jos.command.adduser 4)
   Supervisor password was in key library. A-OK!

=== END. ===

A couple of points: When invoking &quot;adduser guan2&quot; interactively, &quot;adduser&quot;
asks for a password. But when invoking non-interactively, &quot;adduser&quot; checks
the &quot;key library&quot; of the current user. &quot;Keys&quot; are generated from passwords
and the system key library, because passwords can't be used
non-interactively. Just a security thought.
