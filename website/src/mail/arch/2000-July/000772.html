<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Another question:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I have about 3 ATI RageII (mach64) graphics cards and I would love to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; write some Java drivers to use these. Probably just enabling a
</I>1024x768x16
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; mode would be a great achievement, but I don't really know enough
</I>about
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; video hardware to do this easily.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Somewhere there has to be information on using VESA modes.  I've looked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> around but haven't found any.  Most newer cards (like the mach64 series)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use the VESA API, either directly or through an executable BIOS
</I>extension.
&gt;&gt;<i> It's definitely worth looking into if we want higher resolutions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Hmm, do many cards support this? What is the name of the standard?
</I>
It's called the VESA standard :-).  It stands for Video Electronics
Standards Association.  Most modern video cards support version 1.2 (the
latest release, which also supports protected mode calls).  Note that the
VESA standard requires INT 0x10 calls to be made, which I'm not sure are
supported under a protected mode machine.  Most SVGA video driver's I've
seen just implement a switch-to-a-mode method, and everything else seems to
be standard.

I wrote a set of VESA graphics routines in C for DOS4/GW a while back (and
I dunno if I've told this group that or not).  I'll send it to all
interested parties.  It supports only 256 color modes, but it might be a
good starting point.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some libraries are good about having technical information like that,
</I>but
&gt;&gt;<i> many do not.  I was lucky enough to find a book about EGA/VGA
</I>programming
&gt;&gt;<i> that has tons of information about the base-level architecture of
</I>graphics
&gt;&gt;<i> cards.  Unfortunately, chipset-specific stuff is probably not available,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unless through ATI's website.  Good luck!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Well I need to get familiar with the kinds of techniques used in this type
</I>&gt;<i>computing. So even just understanding how a plain VGA board works will
</I>&gt;<i>help me a lot.
</I>
If you can find it, Addison-Wesley published a book called &quot;Programmer's
Guide to the EGA and VGA Cards&quot;, by Richard F. Ferraro.  I've got the
second edition, which includes info on SVGA cards.  It's pretty old, though
(1990).

&gt;<i> &gt; Today I felt like working on some graphics stuff again, so I compiled
</I>some
&gt;<i> &gt; native code to allow me to run Thomas Boceks' VGA driver on Linux.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I had to do an iopl(3) to allow the linux process to access the IO
</I>ports.
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then I telnetted to a linux box and ran the java interpreter on there
</I>as
&gt;<i> &gt; root.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The driver seems to switch the video mode, but I don't see the jos logo
</I>as
&gt;<i> &gt; expected (the bitblt routine should show the logo).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I suspect the problem may be that the linux graphics drivers are
</I>already
&gt;<i> &gt; running to enable the virtual text consoles. They are probably putting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the card in some mode that the driver doesn't expect. Does anyone know
</I>how
&gt;<i> &gt; I can disable these consoles, or somehow unload the graphics driver?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's also possible that the driver just doesn't work right.  Todd et al
</I>&gt;<i> had stated that it was incredibly slow.
</I>
No. I have personally tested the driver on an earlier setup (not on Linux)
and it worked consistently. It was slow, but it was also on a 486DX100.

&gt;<i> I personally am tempted to
</I>&gt;<i> rewrite it in mostly native code, primarily for speed reasons, and also
</I>&gt;<i> because I have sample VGA code in ASM.  This kind of defeats the purpose
</I>&gt;<i> of a Java-based driver, but we all want performance too, right?
</I>
I would like to discourage you from doing that. You would just be
rewriting what has already been done many times. We might as well just
build an environment that supports drivers from an existing OS and use
those.

With the JIT I'm working on the runtime will be able to generate fast
native code without hand-coding assembler. It will also allow you to code
something in asm if it's really necessary. But writing native JNI-type
code is really not desirable. Invoking those methods has a lot of overhead
and it is a pain to write.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another question:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have about 3 ATI RageII (mach64) graphics cards and I would love to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; write some Java drivers to use these. Probably just enabling a
</I>1024x768x16
&gt;<i> &gt; mode would be a great achievement, but I don't really know enough about

&gt;<i> It's definitely worth looking into if we want higher resolutions.
</I>
Hmm, do many cards support this? What is the name of the standard?

&gt;<i> &gt; I have the source code for the mach64 drivers from XFree86, but I need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more background knowledge about how this stuff works. Can someone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recommend a book or a web article that would help me out?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some libraries are good about having technical information like that, but
</I>&gt;<i> many do not.  I was lucky enough to find a book about EGA/VGA programming
