<PRE>&gt;<i> A system programming language might support an extension of a native method
</I>&gt;<i> with assembler or C/C++. I really don't like the idea of keeping my .java
</I>&gt;<i> and .c code in separate files.
</I>
	Java is designed to be a portable application language, so it does
make sense to write machine-specific code in another language.  (It is, of
course, possible to provide a library which isolates that machine code,
and there is the beginning of such a library in the last distribution of
jJOS/decaf.  The problem is that the code is interpreted, which makes it
run very slowly; JIT compiling the calls to their equivalent ASM should
not be terribly difficult, though it's quite a bit away.  At that point,
the argument for or against drivers in Java becomes more a language
purity issue.)  That being said, your proposal makes sense.

	The first-pass approach to implementing this would be a
pre-processor (actually, running a C preprocessor on Java source files
could come in handy, but I digress) which sucked the C code out of native
function blocks, rewrote the .java file to remove that code and have the
proper syntax, wrapped the C code with JNI, and dumped it into a .c file,
then called the appropriate compilers.  While this is a lot of grunt work,
it also doesn't look particularly difficult; you could probably get a
reasonable approximation done in shell script :)
