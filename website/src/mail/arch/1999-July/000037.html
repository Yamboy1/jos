<PRE>Oops.  I've noticed that I consistently used SmartRegistry where I should
have said Registry or possibly SmartAPI.  Both are needed to make JOS
future-ready.  

Gilbert:  Are you planning to change the Registry API after your experiences
creating version 1?  I am a little confused whether the code in
Registry1Lessons is the basis for the new API or the current one.
Admitedly, I am only starting to read your pages on that, and I'm sure it'll
become clear as I get time to read it fully, but a quick confirmation would
be nice.

Thanks,
Avery J. Regier

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe I shall take this out of your e-mail and frame it. It will
</I>&gt;<i> hang
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; upon the wall in my office.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> I will kindly ignore your flame.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;If we do not implement the standard, and instead try to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;'correct' it, we are ourselves introducing incompatibilities into the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;platform.  Suddenly someone writing an application on JOS doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;automatically get compatibility with Java on Win32.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Our responsibility is different for two different platforms. We cannot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; correct the standard of the 100% Pure Java platform. But in addition to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 100% Pure Java platform, we are creating this other thing. We are
</I>&gt;<i> building
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this JOS platform. And application written directly to JOS does not have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suffer any of the design flaws created by Sun. It only has to suffer the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; flaws created by the JOS organization. When we build the JOS platform,
</I>&gt;<i> we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should make it right. We shouldn't build flaws into the JOS platform
</I>&gt;<i> just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because there are problems with the Java API.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> I completely agree with this.  In the question that started this whole
</I>&gt;<i> mess,
</I>&gt;<i> Sean is working to create a new Toolkit that we can use to jumpstart the
</I>&gt;<i> creation of our gui.  Unfortunately, Sean has to rely on Sun API's and
</I>&gt;<i> work
</I>&gt;<i> around shortsightedness in Sun's implementation.  Thus, Sean's code is
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily tailored to one set of versions of packages of classes written
</I>&gt;<i> by Sun, and must adhere to an API written by Sun.  There is nothing that
</I>&gt;<i> he
</I>&gt;<i> can do to correct this problem in the long term in the class he is writing
</I>&gt;<i> now.  BUT, when we replace the JDK that Sean is using for testing with our
</I>&gt;<i> own implementation (most likely based upon $Classpath) of the API's, we
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> create an org.jos.awt.ToolkitFactory which searches in our JOS
</I>&gt;<i> SmartRegistry
</I>&gt;<i> for the appropriate implementation of the Toolkit for this particular use
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> the Toolkit.  So if we have one application which relies on Swing 1.1.1
</I>&gt;<i> (because it uses Swing 1.1.1 on top of the AWT and we need its peer
</I>&gt;<i> implementation to be consistent) and another which relies on Swing 1.0.3,
</I>&gt;<i> and another which wants to use something not even created yet as its peer
</I>&gt;<i> implementation, all of these settings can be placed in our SmartRegistry
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> JOS will handle it all perfectly and it all just works.  We just need to
</I>&gt;<i> pick the right level at which to make things future ready.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In theory, it is possible to build a JOS application that cannot not run
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sun's JVM. It only runs on JOS, with its kernel. While I don't know a
</I>&gt;<i> way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; around using java.lang, my JOS application doesn't have to _use_ classes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from any other java.* package.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it is possible.  Do we want to encourage this?  Absolutely not.  All
</I>&gt;<i> applications that are tied to the JOS platform should be by nature OS
</I>&gt;<i> utilities, shells, drivers, etc. and distributed with JOS and be a part of
</I>&gt;<i> the JOS project.  Generic applications should never be JOS specific, but
</I>&gt;<i> rather adhere to the Java spec and nothing more.  Additional libraries
</I>&gt;<i> used
</I>&gt;<i> by generic applications should also be built on top of the Java spec and
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> be reliant on JOS libraries.  The only exception to this rule is where
</I>&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;<i> library (for instance java3d) which on other Java platforms uses native
</I>&gt;<i> methods to get its work done, we may choose instead to call JOS specific
</I>&gt;<i> libraries, but all of this is hidden from the application.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm thinking long term. That's what I do. I think the capability is just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; around the corner. I wish there was some way for JOS to take advantage
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> It is just around the corner!  Here's what has to happen:
</I>&gt;<i>    * JJOS+decaf gets to the point where we can begin to integrate
</I>&gt;<i> $Classpath.
</I>&gt;<i>    * We start modifying $Classpath for our specific needs:
</I>&gt;<i>       ** We add muli-process support into both decaf &amp; $Classpath so that
</I>&gt;<i> $Classpath's java.lang is calling org.jos.core.* which will handle things
</I>&gt;<i> like interacting with the SmartRegistry to make sure that each process
</I>&gt;<i> gets
</I>&gt;<i> what it needs.
</I>&gt;<i>       ** We modify the java.awt.Toolkit class to integrate with the
</I>&gt;<i> SmartRegistry and return the proper Toolkit for the situation.
</I>&gt;<i>       ** a whole bunch of other things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the meantime, there are some things that can be worked on:
</I>&gt;<i>    * In order for JOS to be secure, we REALLY need an airtight secure
</I>&gt;<i> SmartRegistry.  It must be encrypted and we need to figure out what kinds
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> protections it will need from the rest of the system to ensure that it is
</I>&gt;<i> too expensive to hack to be worth it.
</I>&gt;<i>    * I need to find time to continue to work on org.jos.core.* and
</I>&gt;<i> defining
</I>&gt;<i> the process model from the view of the JOS API.  This process model will
</I>&gt;<i> need to be used by JADE so that shells can be implemented correctly.
</I>&gt;<i> Integrating org.jos.core.* with your SmartRegistry I think is the critical
</I>&gt;<i> step to ensuring that we can make JOS future-ready.  Care to work together
</I>&gt;<i> on this?
</I>&gt;<i>
