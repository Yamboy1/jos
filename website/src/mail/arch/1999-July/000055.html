<PRE>&gt;<i> My proposal suggests that it is possible to unify three Java platforms
</I>&gt;<i> under one JOS platform. Such unification would eliminate arbitrary
</I>&gt;<i> duplication and redundency. It would also enable us to write native code
</I>&gt;<i> once, not once per Java platform. It would enable us to write our Java
</I>&gt;<i> applications once, not once per Java platform.
</I>
	It should be posisble to write an O/S that will run Sun's current
three platforms.  Whether or not it can be done is still open to question,
as is the exact mechanism by which such a task might be accomplished.  I
would suggest the Right Thing to do is to write JOS's platform without
worrying too much about Sun's, and take care of compatibility problems
with compatability modules.  Sun's platforms will change again, and
probably in ways that aren't compatible with any unified problem we might
come with.  Again, to my understanding, the exact changes to the VM spec
involve either (a) additions that older VMs can safely ignore or
(b) alterations to the interpertation of some parts of the VM or language
spec which either were or are incorrect.

&gt;<i> We don't need an &quot;oddly written&quot; compiler. If we build a multiple process
</I>&gt;<i> JVM, we are already breaking away from the single process JVM standard
</I>&gt;<i> created by Sun. The Java virtual machine specification is clear. By design,
</I>&gt;<i> a JVM must support a single process. 
</I>
	If you don't want your classfile to have java.lang.* references in
it, you need an oddly-written compiler.  By default, all java compilers
import java.lang.*, and java.lang.Object is the defined superclass of
every other class...

	So far as I've read the spec, it doesn't require a single-process
model (thought it might assume one) -- large chunks of the class library
will break in amusing ways if the VM doesn't fake one, but it's entirely
possible to write a multi-process VM that will execute non-process-aware
programs without difficulty; as a matter of fact, for JOS to work, we
*have* to write such a JVM.

&gt;<i> I believe we need a JOS-compatible javac tool. A multiple process JVM is
</I>&gt;<i> likely to need a compiler with multiple process support.
</I>
	Absolutely not.  Processes MUST be an API that has native-code
links into our JVM, otherwise we've just cut ourselves off from every
other java developer out there, which is unacceptable.

	Multiple java processes in a single JVM are simply a matter of
keeping namespaces disjoint.  Certain elements of the extant Java API will
have to be rewritten to act appropriately (i.e. System.exit() will kill
the process, not the system), but the classfile will remain the
same.  To maintain separate namespaces requires a slight modification to
the primordial classloader, and that's it.  Every Java class already
maintains the classloader that loaded it.
