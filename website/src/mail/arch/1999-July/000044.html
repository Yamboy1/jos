I tried to use it a couple of days ago. I gad to tweak it a great lot, and some
stuff still doesn't compile. Some files had the wrong package-names, some the
wrong class-names &amp;c.
It seems strange to me, 'cause if people work with it, that shouldn't be
possible.
Anyways, I can start the little test-thingy they've got, but I haven't coded
against it myself yet.
