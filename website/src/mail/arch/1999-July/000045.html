</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Not necessarily.  I envision the possibility of there being many toolkits
available just as there are many X window manager available.   Each shell
(which extends off of JADE) may implement the Toolkit differently.  I
personally think it is a mistake to embed the Toolkit into JADE.  I had
envisioned JADE as being flexible enough to be the base both TUI's and
GUI's.  Most TUI's won't have a Toolkit at all.  There will be some GUI's
which don't want to use Swing as their peers.  We need to give the shell
writers the flexibility to do whatever they please. 

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In the meantime, there are some things that can be worked on:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * In order for JOS to be secure, we REALLY need an airtight secure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SmartRegistry.  It must be encrypted and we need to figure out what
</I>&gt;<i> kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protections it will need from the rest of the system to ensure that it
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; too expensive to hack to be worth it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I dont know if the registry needs to be encrypted, other then slowing
</I>&gt;<i> things down shouldnt it just be &quot;read-only&quot; to everyone who isnt a
</I>&gt;<i> superuser (maybe even then being &quot;read/write-with-password&quot;)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I'm thinking that the Registry is the prime opportunity for hackers to get
around the security model we implement.  We require a Registry for
configurability, but it will also have to contain settings that directly
specify security.  For instance, if we set in the Registry as a default that
applets may only take up to 30% of the CPU and 1/4 of the System's RAM, and
we didn't secure the Registry such that those settings cannot be changed by
hostile applets, we have failed.  If the system administrator sets the
settings such that a user 'guest' may only access certain files, and the
guest is able to get in and hack the registry to give himself more
permissions, then we have failed.  One way to ensure that the registry is
only changed by those with permissions to change it, is to encrypt it.  Not
just that, but make sure the decryption routines are secure as well.

&gt;<i> That should be part of the core JOS security system is what I think Im
</I>&gt;<i> saying
</I>They are all tied together and dependent on one another.  One hole and the
whole thing is useless.  The registry is part of the security system.

&gt;<i> &gt;    * I need to find time to continue to work on org.jos.core.* and
</I>&gt;<i> defining
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the process model from the view of the JOS API.  This process model will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need to be used by JADE so that shells can be implemented correctly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Integrating org.jos.core.* with your SmartRegistry I think is the
</I>&gt;<i> critical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; step to ensuring that we can make JOS future-ready.  Care to work
</I>&gt;<i> together
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> inter-process communication would be nice for JADE too, how are you
</I>&gt;<i> planning on implementing this (out of curiosity)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,

</I>&gt;<i> _________________________
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Glad you asked!  I'm not really sure!  Right now the system I'm playing with
is that it is all controlled via the shell.  For instance any process can
also be a parent process.  It can spawn other processes.  If the parent
process decides that it is willing to share {x} static data with the child,
it may.  If the parent spawns two processes, and gives both permissions to
its statics, then WALAH!  IPC.  Shells are the parent process for most every
application in the system.  The shell would check the registry to determine
what static class data, if any should be shared with that process.  The data
may not come from the registry, but also could come from user commands, be
they GUI in nature or text commands.  If a GUI shell spawns a text command
shell, then it is possible that an app launched from the GUI and an app
launched from the command shell can do IPC.  This is a simple explanation of
a tough problem, but from JADE's point of view I'm hoping that it will be
just that simple.  It is not so simple from the kernel/JVM point of view.
This complicates the memory and process management tasks a lot.  Figuring
all of this out is really what the org.jos.core.* project is all about.
This is also why I want JADE to be more generic.  Its job is to make all of
this process stuff easy as pie for shells.  All shells should really have to
worry about is human interaction.  JADE takes care of interacting with the
system, as this is what must be consistent across all shells, otherwise our
users would go batty trying to keep it all straight.  

The definition of a process must be consistent accross all shells.  You
start and stop and kill processes with the same API into the jvm+kernel.  A
process whether started from a TUI or GUI is defined the same way for
security and configuration in the registry.  JADE should make it simple to
pull all of that information together so that when a user clicks on an icon
for Netscape, the shell just says to JADE, &quot;JADE.getProgram(&quot;Netscape&quot;,
&quot;Avery&quot;).createProcess();&quot; and it all just works.

Avery J. Regier
