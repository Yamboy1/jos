&gt;<i> I believe I shall take this out of your e-mail and frame it. It will hang
</I>&gt;<i> upon the wall in my office.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I will kindly ignore your flame.

&gt;<i> &gt;If we do not implement the standard, and instead try to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;'correct' it, we are ourselves introducing incompatibilities into the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;platform.  Suddenly someone writing an application on JOS doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;automatically get compatibility with Java on Win32.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Our responsibility is different for two different platforms. We cannot
</I>&gt;<i> correct the standard of the 100% Pure Java platform. But in addition to
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> 100% Pure Java platform, we are creating this other thing. We are building
</I>&gt;<i> this JOS platform. And application written directly to JOS does not have
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> suffer any of the design flaws created by Sun. It only has to suffer the
</I>&gt;<i> flaws created by the JOS organization. When we build the JOS platform, we
</I>&gt;<i> should make it right. We shouldn't build flaws into the JOS platform just
</I>&gt;<i> because there are problems with the Java API.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I completely agree with this.  In the question that started this whole mess,
Sean is working to create a new Toolkit that we can use to jumpstart the
creation of our gui.  Unfortunately, Sean has to rely on Sun API's and work
around shortsightedness in Sun's implementation.  Thus, Sean's code is
necessarily tailored to one set of versions of packages of classes written
by Sun, and must adhere to an API written by Sun.  There is nothing that he
can do to correct this problem in the long term in the class he is writing
now.  BUT, when we replace the JDK that Sean is using for testing with our
own implementation (most likely based upon $Classpath) of the API's, we can
create an org.jos.awt.ToolkitFactory which searches in our JOS SmartRegistry
for the appropriate implementation of the Toolkit for this particular use of
the Toolkit.  So if we have one application which relies on Swing 1.1.1
(because it uses Swing 1.1.1 on top of the AWT and we need its peer
implementation to be consistent) and another which relies on Swing 1.0.3,
and another which wants to use something not even created yet as its peer
implementation, all of these settings can be placed in our SmartRegistry and
JOS will handle it all perfectly and it all just works.  We just need to
pick the right level at which to make things future ready.

&gt;<i> In theory, it is possible to build a JOS application that cannot not run
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> Sun's JVM. It only runs on JOS, with its kernel. While I don't know a way
</I>&gt;<i> around using java.lang, my JOS application doesn't have to _use_ classes
</I>&gt;<i> from any other java.* package.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Yes, it is possible.  Do we want to encourage this?  Absolutely not.  All
applications that are tied to the JOS platform should be by nature OS
utilities, shells, drivers, etc. and distributed with JOS and be a part of
the JOS project.  Generic applications should never be JOS specific, but
rather adhere to the Java spec and nothing more.  Additional libraries used
by generic applications should also be built on top of the Java spec and not
be reliant on JOS libraries.  The only exception to this rule is where some
library (for instance java3d) which on other Java platforms uses native
methods to get its work done, we may choose instead to call JOS specific
libraries, but all of this is hidden from the application.

&gt;<i> I'm thinking long term. That's what I do. I think the capability is just
</I>&gt;<i> around the corner. I wish there was some way for JOS to take advantage of
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>It is just around the corner!  Here's what has to happen:
   * JJOS+decaf gets to the point where we can begin to integrate
$Classpath.
   * We start modifying $Classpath for our specific needs:
      ** We add muli-process support into both decaf &amp; $Classpath so that
$Classpath's java.lang is calling org.jos.core.* which will handle things
like interacting with the SmartRegistry to make sure that each process gets
what it needs.
      ** We modify the java.awt.Toolkit class to integrate with the
SmartRegistry and return the proper Toolkit for the situation.
      ** a whole bunch of other things.

In the meantime, there are some things that can be worked on:
   * In order for JOS to be secure, we REALLY need an airtight secure
SmartRegistry.  It must be encrypted and we need to figure out what kinds of
protections it will need from the rest of the system to ensure that it is
too expensive to hack to be worth it.
   * I need to find time to continue to work on org.jos.core.* and defining
the process model from the view of the JOS API.  This process model will
need to be used by JADE so that shells can be implemented correctly.
Integrating org.jos.core.* with your SmartRegistry I think is the critical
step to ensuring that we can make JOS future-ready.  Care to work together
on this?
