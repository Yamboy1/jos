oy, here we go... :)
 
&gt;<i> It really should be that easy. When we pass &quot;Navigator&quot; to
</I>&gt;<i> JADE.getProgram(), it should be able to look up the full URI. Imagine that
</I>&gt;<i> a program name has no scheme, no path, no query, no fragment. The
</I>&gt;<i> getProgram() method should look it up in a short list of well-known program
</I>&gt;<i> names. That's what short-cuts are for.
</I>
since Im writing the actual JADE class (and dont want it to get to damn
big) how 'bout: JADE.getDefaultProgramManager.getProgram(String program) 
note that I left off the second String user since it is a USER
interface, not userS interface. I think multiple JADE's can interact
with one system (zero to one running on it, n communicating via the
whatever net.protocol)
 
&gt;<i> It may be that our system has a system short-cut path and a user-specific
</I>&gt;<i> short-cut path. Short-cut &quot;files&quot; we talked about would look like a
</I>&gt;<i> registry, too. If we put the full program URI in a short-cut file, like
</I>&gt;<i> Navigator.app, we use the name of the short-cut to load a program.
</I>
basically be a specialized INI file

class=class:netscape.navigator.Main
args=... bla 
bla
bla

or 

class=shortcut:Navigator.app
bla 
bla

 
&gt;<i> When you do not have a short-cut for a program, you can still run it.
</I>&gt;<i> That's when you would supply the full program URI.
</I>
you type in NortonUtilites for Java the UI says &quot;Im sorry I dont have
that reference, kindly show it to me&quot; and has a
FileChooser/search-dialog that lets you associate the name you typed
with a class...
 
&gt;<i> I still think the PATH concept is a good idea. We might list each resource
</I>&gt;<i> where short-cuts are stored similar to the classic PATH. In other words,
</I>&gt;<i> when we pass a program name as an ordinary string to JADE.getProgram(), we
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to abbreviate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These load-and-go mechanisms are in all of the classic operating systems.
</I>&gt;<i> These are Runtime and Process classes, part of the standard API. This
</I>&gt;<i> discussion should make it clear that a shell is not responsible for
</I>&gt;<i> short-cuts. JADE.getProgram() is a system function that must be available
</I>&gt;<i> for all shells _and_ all JOS applications, applets, servlets etc.
</I>
This would be a JADE standard feature, like the systemClipboard that is
avaliable to every UI to let them be more uniform in behaviaor if not
apperance.
 
&gt;<i> And what about the monitoring of a child process? Should createProcess()
</I>&gt;<i> also run (start) a process and return it's int result code? The result code
</I>&gt;<i> is set by System.exit(). It should be passed back to the parent process (if
</I>&gt;<i> the parent is interested).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> getProgram()/createProcess() is incredibly complex. It is important. It
</I>&gt;<i> defines the fundamental mechanism of an operating system: to load custom
</I>&gt;<i> programs. It gets a little easier if we break it down.
</I>
createProcess() being part of the OS, getProgram() being part of JADE
 
&gt;<i> --inside getProgram()
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Handle short-cuts. Translate a program name for a program URI. Since one
</I>&gt;<i> short-cut can make reference to another, repeat if necessary. If there's a
</I>&gt;<i> circular reference, throw an exception.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Verify the program URI. If it is a malformed URI, throw an exception.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Get the class for a program. If the class cannot be found, throw an
</I>&gt;<i> exception.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Verify the class implements the right interface (it can be run() in a
</I>&gt;<i> separate process). If a class doesn't implement the right interface, throw
</I>&gt;<i> an exception.
</I>
Id like it if it didnt require it to implement a different interface, we
want to be compatabile. the Process can be the Thread if it doesnt have
any of its own

&gt;<i> 5. Verify user parameter. If the user is not authorized to use this
</I>&gt;<i> program, throw an exception.
</I>
Id like it if this was in the fs/security system by that I mean if your
not allowed to run a program you cant SEE a program. you cant covet what
you cant see (anticrack teqniques meet Silence of tha Lambs)

&gt;<i> 6. Get an object from the class. If the object cannot be created, throw an
</I>&gt;<i> exception. A custom program must define a default constructor, right?
</I>
I make it a point to always define an empty constructor, it should be
common practice
 
&gt;<i> At this point, a separate process has not been created yet. (No harm done.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> --inside Program.createProcess().
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Create a Process object so that a parent process can monitor the status
</I>&gt;<i> of a child process.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Create process environment for the child process. If a process
</I>&gt;<i> environment cannot be created, throw an exception. It is the process
</I>&gt;<i> environment that must store command-line parameters, not a program.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Configure the program object with its process environment.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Start the program. It runs in a separate thread, right?
</I>
the process environment would be a thread, so that if app z doesnt have
any threads it doesnt cause any problems and it can still spawn its own
 
&gt;<i> --inside custom-program.run();
</I>&gt;<i> 1. A base program provides a getProcessEnvironment() method. The process
</I>&gt;<i> environment maintains the standard input stream, standard output stream,
</I>&gt;<i> standard error stream. The process environment provides all the command
</I>&gt;<i> line parameters. ProcessEnvironment sounds a lot like java.lang.System to me.
</I>
System would be wrapper for ProcessEnvironement for legacy support
 
&gt;<i> JADE.getProgram() should return a Program object:
</I>&gt;<i> public Program JADE.getProgram( String program, String user );
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and Program.createProcess() should return a java.lang.Process object:
</I>&gt;<i> public Process Program.createProcess();
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While we're on the topic of process environment, I've been doing a little
</I>&gt;<i> research. A multiple process JVM may need multiple instances of
</I>&gt;<i> java.lang.System. According to the semantics of the static keyword, you can
</I>&gt;<i> have one instance of java.lang.System for each class loader; but, single
</I>&gt;<i> process JVMs won't allow it. When you have multiple instances of System,
</I>&gt;<i> you don't have to take great pains to handle System.exit(). This is THE
</I>&gt;<i> difference between a multiple process JVM and a single process JVM. A new
</I>&gt;<i> instance of a class loader must be created during getProgram() inside step 3.
</I>
the System.exit() would only affect the current process your saying

I was just looking at the code for System (see below) and System.exit()
just calls Runtime.getRuntime().exit(); maybe thats what we should
concentrate on.
 
&gt;<i> There should be a special JOS-only JVM function to get a new
</I>&gt;<i> PrimordialClassLoader object. There should be a new instance of
</I>&gt;<i> PrimordialClassLoader for each process. Here is where we can reduce the
</I>&gt;<i> demand for RAM with our multiple process JVM: Each instance of
</I>&gt;<i> PrimordialClassLoader shares all system classes...except for a short list,
</I>&gt;<i> like java.lang.System.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure how...but I think java.lang.System.getClassLoader() must
</I>&gt;<i> return the process-specific class loader, while
</I>&gt;<i> java.lang.Object.getClassLoader() can still return null.
</I>
I just doublechecked with the System code and theres no getClassLoader()
there's Object.getClass() but not Object.getClassLoader() you need to
say Object.getClass().getClassLoader()
