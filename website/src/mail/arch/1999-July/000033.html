<PRE>Its somewhat well agreed that we should split the design of the overall
OS into several sections:

JOSBox--JOSystem--Apps(including JADE) 

JOSBox is the virtual hardware, it consists of the real hardware, the
picokernel, and the JVM; its where all the native code is. A &quot;windows
JOSBox&quot; or a &quot;linux JOSBox&quot; can be made so JOS can be run on top of
another OS without having to modifiy it.

JOSystem is of two parts, JOSCore which is the absolute minimum required
for (and can be thought of a second, all java, kernel) JOS to be JOS
(including the generic extension mechanism for...) JOSExtensions which
will be grafted to JOS at runtime via JOSCore and will consist of things
that arent part of minimum JOS, but will include very common things too
(ie a file system). JOSCore holds process and security managers and via
its configuration metamechanism loads one predefined process only at
startup, the default for this being JADE (which the user can then launch
more apps from...)
 
Apps are what people use the OS for, the UI is an app. JADE is the UI,
it lets people run and interact with apps, it provides everything needed
for various types of UI's, like an AWT Toolkit for a GUI. JADE handles
the various process cycles of Apps so non-JOS apps dont have to worry
about it (or more importantly, be aware of).

Given that, we need to design the basic structure for these various
sections. we cant really do anything until we have a basic design, a
basic idea of what to do.  We should discuss what we need/want on our
various levels of expertise until we get a basic design to build off of
(JOS starts, it loads this which looks like that and then...)

lets get a crackin'

Cheers,
DigiGod

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
