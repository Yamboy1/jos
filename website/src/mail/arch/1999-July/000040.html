Oh, my. I'm afraid I wasn't clear. Your statement of goal/mission/purpose
for the JOS Project is stated clearly. I was actually trying to be
agreeable, although it didn't sound like it. I didn't intend to flame.
(Isn't flame akin to being dis-agreeable?)

I would like the JOS Project to use your words in a statement of purpose.
After stating the obvious that our mission is to build a Java-based
operating system, we should say, sincerely, &quot;We, at the JOS Project, are
responsible to implement the Java standard, created by Sun Microsystems, so
that every 100% Pure Java application behaves like it is running in an
environment exactly compatible with the version of the standard it was
written to.&quot;

Such a clear statement of mission turns our attention to solve-able
technical problems and meeting of the minds. It builds enthusiasm,
motivation, and the edge--to go that extra mile. I think you have summed it
up nicely.

If that is our mission, there are direct implications. There is a path to
follow as a consequence of our mission.
