The JOS architecture list (mailto:<A HREF="mailto:arch@jos.org">arch@jos.org</A>) is used to discuss the
low-level Java code between the application layer and the kernel/jvm
layer. Integration of Shark into JOS should probably happen on that
list, while the user interface design itself can be discussed on the
<A HREF="mailto:ui@jos.org">ui@jos.org</A> list.

I have CC'd <A HREF="mailto:arch@jos.org.">arch@jos.org.</A> If anyone wishes to continue this thread, you
should perhaps remove <A HREF="mailto:kernel@jos.org">kernel@jos.org</A> from the mail header.

Now, back to the discussion...

The good think about Shark is that it works and we can start using it
straight away. If Sean's project ends up being better than Shark in the
future, then we can switch to it when it's ready.

Has anyone here got Shark working? From memory, it didn't work right out
of the box when I tried it. I haven't had a look since but if anyone
manages to install it, could you possibly email the list how you got it
to work? (ie. if you had any problems).
