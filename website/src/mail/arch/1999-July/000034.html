A. We, at the JOS Project, are responsible to implement that standard
(created by Sun Microsystems) so that every 100% Pure Java application
behaves like it is running in an environment exactly compatible with the
version of the standard it was written to.

I believe I shall take this out of your e-mail and frame it. It will hang
upon the wall in my office.

&gt;<i>If we do not implement the standard, and instead try to

</I>
Our responsibility is different for two different platforms. We cannot
correct the standard of the 100% Pure Java platform. But in addition to the
100% Pure Java platform, we are creating this other thing. We are building
this JOS platform. And application written directly to JOS does not have to
suffer any of the design flaws created by Sun. It only has to suffer the
flaws created by the JOS organization. When we build the JOS platform, we
should make it right. We shouldn't build flaws into the JOS platform just
because there are problems with the Java API.

In theory, it is possible to build a JOS application that cannot not run on
Sun's JVM. It only runs on JOS, with its kernel. While I don't know a way
around using java.lang, my JOS application doesn't have to _use_ classes
from any other java.* package.

I truely believe this. This is what everybody thinks when they hear write
once. It runs on the version of the standard it was written to. I see
nothing wrong with running three (or more) JVMs on top of the JOS kernel.
If only we have the resources to do it, this is exactly what we should do.

What does it mean for JOS architecture? It means that there is one JOS
kernel and three (or more) JVMs. Now that would be asking a lot, except for
one thing. I know that Java 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 (1.2) are mostly compatible.
While they are incompatible with running a Java 1.0 application inside a
1.2 JVM, it is possible to build an architecture that our three JVMs share
most of their infrastructure.

All three JVMs must implement an OS file subsystem; but, there will be only
version of the source. All three JVMs must implement a peer-ui package;
but, there will be only one version of the source.

The problem was porting. Nobody wants to port. It has been a necessary
evil. Sun has re-introduced the evils of porting again by creating three
versions of Java. It didn't have to be this way.

We can do something about it. We can build a JOS platform that has one JOS
kernel. The JOS kernel loads and runs one or more JVMs, each in a separate
process. You can start and stop JVMs. There should be three JVMs to choose
from. Java 1.0, 1.1 or 2.0 (1.2). And when Java 3.0 is available, there
will be four. You can run multiple copies of Java 1.0 JVM...but only one
copy of its bytecode will be loaded. Same with 1.1 and 1.2.

Why...we'll be more compatible with Java than Sun.

&gt;<i>In the meantime, we have a technical issue brought about by Sun's decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>We don't have the capabliity described above yet, though we will try to work
</I>&gt;<i>towards it.  Let the developers do what they need to do in the meantime to
</I>&gt;<i>just make it work.
</I>
I'm thinking long term. That's what I do. I think the capability is just
around the corner. I wish there was some way for JOS to take advantage of it.

I am disgusted with Sun Microsystems because, everywhere I look, they are
the same. They doing the same kind of things that lead Microsoft Windows
down a dead-end road. Here is what Microsoft (and Sun) have done: Ignore
compatiblity. Frustrate their customers. Trash all of their customer's
code. Offend people they haven't met. Mindlessly upgrade. Mindlessly
upgrade. Mindlessly upgrade. Throw their products away. Shrink the software
industry.

I want a new OS because these organizations are incapable of building an
operating system that lasts.
