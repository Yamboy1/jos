<PRE>&gt;<i> I have been looking for this mechanism in the wrong place. IF we have a
</I>&gt;<i> single process JVM that works, why can't we create multiple instances of
</I>&gt;<i> it? We should plan to create a multiple process JVM in three steps: (1)
</I>&gt;<i> single-process, (2) inefficient multi-process, (3) streamlined multi-process.
</I>
	Primarily because multiple native threads/processes is an
enourmous project for the kernel author.  Once we had such a kernel,
however, it would be another project of only slightly lesser difficulty to
make such an arrangement efficient, because we'd have to implement IPC and
all that attendant nastiness.  (Basically, we'd be implementing
multi-processor support without the benefit of a second processor...)
Aside from the difficulties of groundwork (including a new garbage
collector!), the interperter currently assumes that it can't be
interrupted in the middle of a java bytecode.  Allowing this to happen
would be Very Bad Mojo, and either of the ways to handle it (forbidding it
to happen, or rewriting to make it safe) are labor and code intensive.
