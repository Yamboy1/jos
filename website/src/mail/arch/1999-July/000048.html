<PRE>	Just a note: while you can't get around using java.lang.* (at
least, not without your own rather oddly written compiler), decaf
shouldn't have any problems supporting more than one instance of those
classes distributed over multiple processes, thought the native calls
could get quite messy.

	Another note: it's rather important to bear in my the distinction
between the java language and the java platform.  The problem is that Sun
doesn't keep this distinction terribly sharp... JOS is its own platform.
The question standing before us is: should we make JOS a superset of the
Java platform, or should we ignore the Java platform so far as possible
and write a jBCS* module up later?


* jBCS: the notional equivalent of Linux's (et al) intel Binary
Compatiblity System.

	There are important ramifications.  (Warning: the previous was an
understatement of epic proportions.  You may wish to adjust your scale of
thinking. :))  The first one that comes to *my* mind is the question of
difficulty: would it be substantially more difficult to write jBCS modules
for a system that may or may not substantially resemble Sun's Java
platform(s) than it would be to write a superset of Sun's Java platform
(pick one) that has a mysterious way of running what amounts
incompabitbile binaries?  The initial response in my mind is: the Right
Way to write such a superset would be with jBCS modules.  Therefore, the
difficulties come down to which notional JOS platform (our own, or some
superset) would be more amenable to jBCS modules.

	[ Sidebar: an application of the jBCS modules, if they really do
need to end up modifying the way in which certain bytecodes are executed,
and that this is done well, would be automagic support the binfmt_* idea
from linux.  This would include things like _perl, _tcltk, _javascript,
and so on.  At any rate... ]

	It might be worthwhile to investigate how the WINE project is
handling its Win3.1/Win95/Win98 problems, which amount to almost the same
thing: the platform (i386) is the same, but with large differences in the
libraries, and (perhaps) subtle differences in the way that the libraries
are understood (by the applications.)

&gt;<i> It is just around the corner!  Here's what has to happen:
</I>&gt;<i>    * JJOS+decaf gets to the point where we can begin to integrate
</I>&gt;<i> $Classpath.
</I>
	Soon.  Maybe as early as late September.

	As for modifying classpath to support processes, I'm very
sincerely hoping we won't have to do much at all.  Since spawning
processes would have to be handled by a separate library (jos.core.proc?)
anyway, we should be able to do all the slight-of-hand necessary behind
closed doors, so to speak, and thus not fork classpath, which has enough
to do already.
