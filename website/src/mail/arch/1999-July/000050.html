But wait! This reminds me of something else that's important, too.

It really should be that easy. When we pass &quot;Navigator&quot; to
JADE.getProgram(), it should be able to look up the full URI. Imagine that
a program name has no scheme, no path, no query, no fragment. The
getProgram() method should look it up in a short list of well-known program
names. That's what short-cuts are for.

It may be that our system has a system short-cut path and a user-specific
short-cut path. Short-cut &quot;files&quot; we talked about would look like a
registry, too. If we put the full program URI in a short-cut file, like
Navigator.app, we use the name of the short-cut to load a program.

When you do not have a short-cut for a program, you can still run it.
That's when you would supply the full program URI.

I still think the PATH concept is a good idea. We might list each resource
where short-cuts are stored similar to the classic PATH. In other words,
when we pass a program name as an ordinary string to JADE.getProgram(), we
should be able to abbreviate.

These load-and-go mechanisms are in all of the classic operating systems.
These are Runtime and Process classes, part of the standard API. This
discussion should make it clear that a shell is not responsible for
short-cuts. JADE.getProgram() is a system function that must be available
for all shells _and_ all JOS applications, applets, servlets etc.

And what about the monitoring of a child process? Should createProcess()
also run (start) a process and return it's int result code? The result code
is set by System.exit(). It should be passed back to the parent process (if
the parent is interested).

getProgram()/createProcess() is incredibly complex. It is important. It
defines the fundamental mechanism of an operating system: to load custom
programs. It gets a little easier if we break it down.

--inside getProgram()
1. Handle short-cuts. Translate a program name for a program URI. Since one
short-cut can make reference to another, repeat if necessary. If there's a
circular reference, throw an exception.
2. Verify the program URI. If it is a malformed URI, throw an exception.
3. Get the class for a program. If the class cannot be found, throw an
exception.
4. Verify the class implements the right interface (it can be run() in a
separate process). If a class doesn't implement the right interface, throw
an exception.
5. Verify user parameter. If the user is not authorized to use this
program, throw an exception.
6. Get an object from the class. If the object cannot be created, throw an
exception. A custom program must define a default constructor, right?

At this point, a separate process has not been created yet. (No harm done.)

--inside Program.createProcess().
1. Create a Process object so that a parent process can monitor the status
of a child process.
2. Create process environment for the child process. If a process
environment cannot be created, throw an exception. It is the process
environment that must store command-line parameters, not a program.
3. Configure the program object with its process environment.
4. Start the program. It runs in a separate thread, right?

--inside custom-program.run();
1. A base program provides a getProcessEnvironment() method. The process
environment maintains the standard input stream, standard output stream,
standard error stream. The process environment provides all the command
line parameters. ProcessEnvironment sounds a lot like java.lang.System to me.

JADE.getProgram() should return a Program object:
public Program JADE.getProgram( String program, String user );

and Program.createProcess() should return a java.lang.Process object:
public Process Program.createProcess();

While we're on the topic of process environment, I've been doing a little
research. A multiple process JVM may need multiple instances of
java.lang.System. According to the semantics of the static keyword, you can
have one instance of java.lang.System for each class loader; but, single
process JVMs won't allow it. When you have multiple instances of System,
you don't have to take great pains to handle System.exit(). This is THE
difference between a multiple process JVM and a single process JVM. A new
instance of a class loader must be created during getProgram() inside step 3.

There should be a special JOS-only JVM function to get a new
PrimordialClassLoader object. There should be a new instance of
PrimordialClassLoader for each process. Here is where we can reduce the
demand for RAM with our multiple process JVM: Each instance of
PrimordialClassLoader shares all system classes...except for a short list,
like java.lang.System.

I'm not sure how...but I think java.lang.System.getClassLoader() must
return the process-specific class loader, while
java.lang.Object.getClassLoader() can still return null.
