Sounds good.

&gt;<i>Sun's platforms will change again, and probably in ways that aren't

</I>&gt;<i>additions that older VMs can safely ignore or (b) alterations to the
</I>&gt;<i>interpertation of some parts of the VM or language spec which either 
</I>&gt;<i>were or are incorrect.
</I>
We should expect Sun's platform to change. And with their track record, we
can reasonably expect their changes to be incompatible. That's why I would
like to see an architecture that doesn't crumble under the weight of just
one more change.

&gt;&gt;<i> We don't need an &quot;oddly written&quot; compiler. If we build a multiple process
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> JVM, we are already breaking away from the single process JVM standard
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> created by Sun. The Java virtual machine specification is clear. By design,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a JVM must support a single process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	If you don't want your classfile to have java.lang.* references in
</I>&gt;<i>it, you need an oddly-written compiler.  By default, all java compilers
</I>&gt;<i>import java.lang.*, and java.lang.Object is the defined superclass of
</I>&gt;<i>every other class...
</I>
I want application programs to have java.* references. I want many JOS
applications to have java.* references. I'm talking about building JOS, not
building applications that run on top of JOS.

&gt;<i>	So far as I've read the spec, it doesn't require a single-process
</I>&gt;<i>model (thought it might assume one) -- large chunks of the class library
</I>&gt;<i>will break in amusing ways if the VM doesn't fake one, but it's entirely
</I>&gt;<i>possible to write a multi-process VM that will execute non-process-aware
</I>&gt;<i>programs without difficulty; as a matter of fact, for JOS to work, we
</I>&gt;<i>*have* to write such a JVM.
</I>
There is a book called the Java Virtual Machine. In chapter one, it says
that Sun intended a native process to make multiple JVMs available on a
single machine. It isn't encouraging. It says that Sun doesn't want anyone
to go beyond one process/one JVM.

The JOS Project may be the only organization that is giving serious
throught to a multiple process JVM. Although I would like to work within a
multiple process JVM, it is not required for JOS to work. There are
alternatives.

A multiple process JVM for JOS should follow the development of a single
process JVM for JOS. If we build a single process JVM that works, we can
expand it for multiple processes.

&gt;&gt;<i> I believe we need a JOS-compatible javac tool. A multiple process JVM is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> likely to need a compiler with multiple process support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	Absolutely not.  Processes MUST be an API that has native-code
</I>&gt;<i>links into our JVM, otherwise we've just cut ourselves off from every
</I>&gt;<i>other java developer out there, which is unacceptable.
</I>
Again, I'm talking about building JOS. How do you compile the classes in
java.lang.*?

&gt;<i>	Multiple java processes in a single JVM are simply a matter of
</I>&gt;<i>keeping namespaces disjoint.  Certain elements of the extant Java API will
</I>&gt;<i>have to be rewritten to act appropriately (i.e. System.exit() will kill
</I>&gt;<i>the process, not the system), but the classfile will remain the
</I>&gt;<i>same.  To maintain separate namespaces requires a slight modification to
</I>&gt;<i>the primordial classloader, and that's it.  Every Java class already
</I>&gt;<i>maintains the classloader that loaded it.
</I>
Yes, it's in the class loader. It isn't as difficult as it sometimes
sounds. We must change the JVM to create a separate class loader for each
process.

I just got an idea. Why don't we change the start-up sequence? Why doesn't
the java tool call our JOS launcher instead of custom.main()? I'll have to
think about that more. When the java tool initializes the JVM, it calls
custom.main() only because that's the standard convention. What if the java
tool calls JOS.main() and passes the name of the custom class to launch?
JOS.main() can create a new PrimordialClassLoader() with no problem.
