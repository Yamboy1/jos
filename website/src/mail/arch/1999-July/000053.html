That's the way it should be. I really want a shell like that. Non-technical
people (all 5 billion of them) want a shell like that, too.

And if that weren't enough, we have the strength of Java and the power of
the network, too. This means that when you type in NortonUtilities, the
short-cuts for NortonUtilities may be stored on a network service
(Internet/intranet). The local shell can &quot;look-up&quot; the NortonUtilities
short-cut, like looking up a domain name with DNS. So we need a short-cut
&quot;look-up&quot; service for JOS.

When I want HTML pages from the JOS Project, I type &quot;<A HREF="http://www.jos.org/",">http://www.jos.org/&quot;,</A>
right? When I want to run the JOS MegaSmartHTMLBrowser Pro, I should be
able to type &quot;<A HREF="shortcut://www.jos.org/MegaSmartHTMLBrowserPro"">shortcut://www.jos.org/MegaSmartHTMLBrowserPro&quot;</A> at the
command line. The short-cut is downloaded; plus all of the packages used by
this application are downloaded. It is seemless. It is easy. It is
future-oriented, too.

What if I don't trust that code? If my shell supports it, I can reduce the
shell to sand-box permissions. Or, I can open a new partition, with only
sand-box permissions. Then, I type in the same command. Bytecode for that
application is sand-boxed on a package-by-package basis.

Plus, the actual byte codes to run NortonUtilities does *not* have to be
installed on your local drive. JOS can download the bytecode from an
Internet/intranet application service (if you like), keep it in a local LRU
bytecode cache. JOS can &quot;download&quot; the bytecode from a floppy or CD-ROM or
game cartridge.

What does it mean? It means there doesn't have to be an explicit
installation step. If you want to run NortonUtilities, you type
NortonUtilities on a command line or click on the NortonUtilities
short-cut. It runs even if it has never been installed.

This is something that you just can't do on any other operating system.
This is where JOS shines. It is the strength of using Java to build an OS.

For non-technicians, they want a high quality operating system. They want
to run programs (not install them). They want to experiment with stuff (not
commit to it). They change their mind frequently.

For every program that has a cost-free license, why should there be
separate installation step? If you can install it, you can upgrade it, too.
All of the bytecode on the Internet should be virtually available to your
bytecode cache.

Hey! If you want to distribute your application to lots and lots of people,
you only really need to give them the URI for your shortcut. You can put
such a URI in a hot-link on a webpage. You can send it with e-mail. All the
other complexity is handled by the operating system, and should be.
