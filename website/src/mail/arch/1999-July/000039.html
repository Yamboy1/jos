well a platform only needs one Toolkit, so it would just return the
JOSToolkit

I dont know if the registry needs to be encrypted, other then slowing
things down shouldnt it just be &quot;read-only&quot; to everyone who isnt a
superuser (maybe even then being &quot;read/write-with-password&quot;)?

That should be part of the core JOS security system is what I think Im
saying

&gt;<i>    * I need to find time to continue to work on org.jos.core.* and defining

</I>&gt;<i> Integrating org.jos.core.* with your SmartRegistry I think is the critical

</I>
inter-process communication would be nice for JADE too, how are you
planning on implementing this (out of curiosity)?

Cheers,
