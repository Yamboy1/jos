the Process would be a thread then? (I just woke up, when I wrote that I
was up about 15hours) I want to say that that apps that just have a main
would still run because the Process they were running in was a thread

</I>&gt;<i> that class must implement a well-known interface. We could not, for

</I>&gt;<i> public static void main( String[] args );
</I>
well, yea
 
&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> java.lang.Runnable (could be dangerous)
</I>
I dont know about that, I know half the runnables I made would screw up
royally if they were run as their own app, we should stick with public
static void main(String args[])
 
&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> public interface CustomProcess
</I>&gt;<i>     extends Runnable {
</I>&gt;<i>   public void setProcessEnvironment( ProcessEnvironment v );
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>
something like that would be ok, but it should have a main method also.
you know check if the class has a main, if nto throw a null pointer
exception, see if it implements custom process (or whatever) give it the
extra info then run it like an ordinary up
 
&gt;<i> Correction: I'm not sure how...but I think
</I>&gt;<i> java.lang.System.getClass().getClassLoader() must return the
</I>&gt;<i> process-specific class loader, while
</I>&gt;<i> java.lang.Object.getClass().getClassLoader() can still return null.
</I>
you could never call System.getClass(), its a static class with 0
instances and getClass isnt a static method
 
&gt;<i> And, it may be Runtime rather than System that I'm thinking about. Runtime
</I>&gt;<i> has those exec() methods, too. Exec should be called in the usual way to
</I>&gt;<i> exec a child process--even on JOS.
</I>
