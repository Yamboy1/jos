Ok, let discuss in arch.

Hm, some of Shark are similar to Sean's Project. Since Shark contains
Graphics Drivers and UI Peers Implementation on Linux.

&gt;<i>Has anyone here got Shark working? From memory, it didn't work right out

Hm, I can't got Shark working. I will ask the author how to make Shark
making
and let people have a feel on Shark.

Regarsd,

Hilary
