Excellent plan!

I have been looking for this mechanism in the wrong place. IF we have a
single process JVM that works, why can't we create multiple instances of
it? We should plan to create a multiple process JVM in three steps: (1)
single-process, (2) inefficient multi-process, (3) streamlined multi-process.

I have been looking at the Java Native Interface. In a C/C++ program, you
create an instance of the JVM, like this:

JVM jvm = new JVM( env );

The jvm variable must be used throughout your code.

So why can't we create a java tool that creates more than one instance of a
JVM?

JVM[] jvm = new JVM[ 100 ];
jvm[ 0 ] = new JVM( env );

When a JVM is implemented as a shared library (or dynamic link library),
there is only one instance of the JVM's code in RAM.

In a multiple JVM environment, a C/C++ program can start each JVM in a
separate native thread. Secondary JVMs would use standard inter-process
communication to communicate with the primary JVM.

When we change the start-up sequence of the java and javaw tools, we can
almost use an existing off-the-shelf JVM and the Java Native Interface to
create an inefficient multiple process environment. It is yet another way
to experiment with the primordial class loader. And most of the code would
be written with Java, the programming language.

JVMs are added (and destroyed) as needed. To start secondary JVMs, the Java
Native Interface must communicate with the java tool, not the kernel.
