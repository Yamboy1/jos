<PRE>Hi,

Hm, after reading ur email, I got some questions.

1. What's the different between JVM of JDK1.0, JDK1.1, JDK2.0 ?
    As far as I know, JVM itself hasn't changed a lot. The Library/Classes
of JDK
    has changed a lot from 1.0 to 2.0. If this is true, it isn't affected
JOS Kernel a lots.

2. Will JOS use classes directly from Sun JDK ? Sun JDK got lots of things
that
    are depends on the platform. On Win32, it got Windows Peer, etc. On
Linux
    , it got Motif Peer. Should we think about using the classes from
www.classpath.org ?
    and then we added some JOS feature into it just like the Sun JDK ?

3. About Sun, IMO, after JDK2.0, Sun will decrease rate of introducing new
JDK. Since lots
    of people are blaming Java. Sun will put all of their effect making Java
much faster and
    stable. I don't think we need to think about the future JDK version
comptability. Keep on
    our work.

Regards,

Hilary

</I>&gt;<i>I truely believe this. This is what everybody thinks when they hear write
</I>&gt;<i>once. It runs on the version of the standard it was written to. I see
</I>&gt;<i>nothing wrong with running three (or more) JVMs on top of the JOS kernel.
</I>&gt;<i>If only we have the resources to do it, this is exactly what we should do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What does it mean for JOS architecture? It means that there is one JOS
</I>&gt;<i>kernel and three (or more) JVMs. Now that would be asking a lot, except for
</I>&gt;<i>one thing. I know that Java 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 (1.2) are mostly compatible.
</I>&gt;<i>While they are incompatible with running a Java 1.0 application inside a
</I>&gt;<i>1.2 JVM, it is possible to build an architecture that our three JVMs share
</I>&gt;<i>most of their infrastructure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>All three JVMs must implement an OS file subsystem; but, there will be only
</I>&gt;<i>version of the source. All three JVMs must implement a peer-ui package;
</I>&gt;<i>but, there will be only one version of the source.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The problem was porting. Nobody wants to port. It has been a necessary
</I>&gt;<i>evil. Sun has re-introduced the evils of porting again by creating three
</I>&gt;<i>versions of Java. It didn't have to be this way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We can do something about it. We can build a JOS platform that has one JOS
</I>&gt;<i>kernel. The JOS kernel loads and runs one or more JVMs, each in a separate
</I>&gt;<i>process. You can start and stop JVMs. There should be three JVMs to choose
</I>&gt;<i>from. Java 1.0, 1.1 or 2.0 (1.2). And when Java 3.0 is available, there
</I>&gt;<i>will be four. You can run multiple copies of Java 1.0 JVM...but only one
</I>&gt;<i>copy of its bytecode will be loaded. Same with 1.1 and 1.2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Why...we'll be more compatible with Java than Sun.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>In the meantime, we have a technical issue brought about by Sun's
</I>decisions.
&gt;&gt;<i>We don't have the capabliity described above yet, though we will try to
</I>work
&gt;&gt;<i>towards it.  Let the developers do what they need to do in the meantime to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>just make it work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'm thinking long term. That's what I do. I think the capability is just
</I>&gt;<i>around the corner. I wish there was some way for JOS to take advantage of
</I>it.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I am disgusted with Sun Microsystems because, everywhere I look, they are
</I>&gt;<i>the same. They doing the same kind of things that lead Microsoft Windows
</I>&gt;<i>down a dead-end road. Here is what Microsoft (and Sun) have done: Ignore
</I>&gt;<i>compatiblity. Frustrate their customers. Trash all of their customer's
</I>&gt;<i>code. Offend people they haven't met. Mindlessly upgrade. Mindlessly
</I>&gt;<i>upgrade. Mindlessly upgrade. Throw their products away. Shrink the software
</I>&gt;<i>industry.
</I>
Well, that's we called &quot;Business&quot;. It is much different from Open Source
World.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I want a new OS because these organizations are incapable of building an
</I>&gt;<i>operating system that lasts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
me2, I want a new OS that would be build on Java. :D

Hilary
