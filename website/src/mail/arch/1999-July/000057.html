your underestimating...
 
&gt;<i> And if that weren't enough, we have the strength of Java and the power of
</I>&gt;<i> the network, too. This means that when you type in NortonUtilities, the
</I>&gt;<i> short-cuts for NortonUtilities may be stored on a network service
</I>&gt;<i> (Internet/intranet). The local shell can &quot;look-up&quot; the NortonUtilities
</I>&gt;<i> short-cut, like looking up a domain name with DNS. So we need a short-cut
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;look-up&quot; service for JOS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When I want HTML pages from the JOS Project, I type &quot;<A HREF="http://www.jos.org/",">http://www.jos.org/&quot;,</A>
</I>&gt;<i> right? When I want to run the JOS MegaSmartHTMLBrowser Pro, I should be
</I>&gt;<i> able to type &quot;<A HREF="shortcut://www.jos.org/MegaSmartHTMLBrowserPro"">shortcut://www.jos.org/MegaSmartHTMLBrowserPro&quot;</A> at the
</I>&gt;<i> command line. The short-cut is downloaded; plus all of the packages used by
</I>&gt;<i> this application are downloaded. It is seemless. It is easy. It is
</I>&gt;<i> future-oriented, too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What if I don't trust that code? If my shell supports it, I can reduce the
</I>&gt;<i> shell to sand-box permissions. Or, I can open a new partition, with only
</I>&gt;<i> sand-box permissions. Then, I type in the same command. Bytecode for that
</I>&gt;<i> application is sand-boxed on a package-by-package basis.
</I>
that kind of security should be built into JADE so all shells have it
 
&gt;<i> Plus, the actual byte codes to run NortonUtilities does *not* have to be
</I>&gt;<i> installed on your local drive. JOS can download the bytecode from an
</I>&gt;<i> Internet/intranet application service (if you like), keep it in a local LRU
</I>&gt;<i> bytecode cache. JOS can &quot;download&quot; the bytecode from a floppy or CD-ROM or
</I>&gt;<i> game cartridge.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What does it mean? It means there doesn't have to be an explicit
</I>&gt;<i> installation step. If you want to run NortonUtilities, you type
</I>&gt;<i> NortonUtilities on a command line or click on the NortonUtilities
</I>&gt;<i> short-cut. It runs even if it has never been installed.
</I>
we'd have to have support for all that silly e-commerce stuff so they
can pay the one cent to use the app one time or the 29.95us to be always
granted access to it.
 
&gt;<i> This is something that you just can't do on any other operating system.
</I>&gt;<i> This is where JOS shines. It is the strength of using Java to build an OS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For non-technicians, they want a high quality operating system. They want
</I>&gt;<i> to run programs (not install them). They want to experiment with stuff (not
</I>&gt;<i> commit to it). They change their mind frequently.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For every program that has a cost-free license, why should there be
</I>&gt;<i> separate installation step? If you can install it, you can upgrade it, too.
</I>&gt;<i> All of the bytecode on the Internet should be virtually available to your
</I>&gt;<i> bytecode cache.
</I>
tech support people are going to hate us
&quot;did you install on your computer or just run it once off the internet&quot;
&quot;did I what with my what now?&quot;
&quot;sigh&quot;
 
&gt;<i> Hey! If you want to distribute your application to lots and lots of people,
</I>&gt;<i> you only really need to give them the URI for your shortcut. You can put
</I>&gt;<i> such a URI in a hot-link on a webpage. You can send it with e-mail. All the
</I>&gt;<i> other complexity is handled by the operating system, and should be.
</I>
viva la JOS

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial

	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
