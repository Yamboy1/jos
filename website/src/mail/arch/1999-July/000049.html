ugh, that would take up more memorty then Id like to think. its a good
start mind you, but we could create a &quot;multiprocess aware&quot; java.lang
(changing nothing of course) that is maintained by the master process
(the kernel) and accesed by all its children.
 
&gt;<i>         Another note: it's rather important to bear in my the distinction

Im not entirely clear of what this would mean but Im guessing more
native code then Id like anyone to have to port to all the
machine-platforms Id like us to support (people on macs should be able
to use it too) and its just going to confuse the issue more anyway
 
&gt;<i>         There are important ramifications.  (Warning: the previous was an
</I>&gt;<i> understatement of epic proportions.  You may wish to adjust your scale of
</I>&gt;<i> thinking. :))  The first one that comes to *my* mind is the question of
</I>&gt;<i> difficulty: would it be substantially more difficult to write jBCS modules
</I>&gt;<i> for a system that may or may not substantially resemble Sun's Java

</I>&gt;<i> Way to write such a superset would be with jBCS modules.  Therefore, the
</I>&gt;<i> difficulties come down to which notional JOS platform (our own, or some
</I>&gt;<i> superset) would be more amenable to jBCS modules.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         [ Sidebar: an application of the jBCS modules, if they really do
</I>&gt;<i> need to end up modifying the way in which certain bytecodes are executed,
</I>&gt;<i> and that this is done well, would be automagic support the binfmt_* idea
</I>&gt;<i> from linux.  This would include things like _perl, _tcltk, _javascript,
</I>&gt;<i> and so on.  At any rate... ]
</I>
its not my area, but Im going to say superset (+ a line to sun telling
them they should put it in Java anyway)
 
&gt;<i>         It might be worthwhile to investigate how the WINE project is
</I>&gt;<i> handling its Win3.1/Win95/Win98 problems, which amount to almost the same
</I>&gt;<i> thing: the platform (i386) is the same, but with large differences in the
</I>&gt;<i> libraries, and (perhaps) subtle differences in the way that the libraries
</I>&gt;<i> are understood (by the applications.)
</I>
WINE?
 
&gt;<i>         As for modifying classpath to support processes, I'm very
</I>&gt;<i> sincerely hoping we won't have to do much at all.  Since spawning
</I>&gt;<i> processes would have to be handled by a separate library (jos.core.proc?)
</I>&gt;<i> anyway, we should be able to do all the slight-of-hand necessary behind
</I>&gt;<i> closed doors, so to speak, and thus not fork classpath, which has enough
</I>&gt;<i> to do already.
</I>
jos.process?

someone should change the subject on this thread, this doesnt sound like
peer-ui mapping to me ;)
