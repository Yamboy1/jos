<PRE>&gt;<i> 1. What's the different between JVM of JDK1.0, JDK1.1, JDK2.0 ?
</I>&gt;<i>     As far as I know, JVM itself hasn't changed a lot. The Library/Classes of JDK
</I>&gt;<i>     has changed a lot from 1.0 to 2.0. If this is true, it isn't affected JOS Kernel a lots.
</I>
	Mostly, the JVM spec has changed in how it addresses various bits
and pieces that were broken either in the original spec or in the original
implementation(s) of the JVM from Sun (quite frequently both, and in
incompatible ways).  It's a horrible mess, and I have a great desire to
wash my hands of the whole thing.  Since I'm not writing the class
libraries ( classpath is! ), I can basically take the position that I'm
writing to Rev 2 of the JVM spec, which, AFAIK, is the spec equivalent to
the &quot;Java 2&quot; platform, and that classpath is (will be) the Canonical Code,
that is, I won't 'fix' anything broken in the spec if it will break
classpath.  This will undoubtedly make me rather unpopular with a great
number of people, but since even the Rev 2 JVM/Java Language spec is
*still* broken in many horribly fascinating ways, the temptation to sit it
out and wait for the academics to fix it is very strong.  (Notably, Java's
official memory model is, to my understanding, a standing joke to JVM
designers; a similar example is the classloader-spoof attack, which can be
fixed in one of two mutually incompatible ways; one of which is the Right
Thing from a language-design perspective, and the other the Right Thing
from the platform-design perspective.)

	Currently, enourmous chunks of the JVM spec in decaf are missing,
and, in fact, the compatibility in decaf most closely resembles jdk 1.0.2.
Of course, since Sun charges for the JCK, I couldn't tell you how well 
I'm actually doing.	

	Summary: the coder at the keyboard (me) is going to write
something that works with classpath, unless the JOS project has a whole
lot of extra coders lying around that I'm unfamiliar with who have
mysteriously generated our own (more-)correct class library.  I rather
suspect we won't hash out the Right Thing regarding compatibility for
quite a while yet anyway...
