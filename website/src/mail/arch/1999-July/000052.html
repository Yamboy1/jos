High quality operating systems use &quot;partitions&quot;. Partitions are used to
protect the operation of a machine while new applications are being built.
Partitions prevent raw experimental code (test) from interfering with
stable code (production). Classpath is the classic way to have two (or
more) copies of the same code running one a processor at the same time.

How do we develop JOS on JOS? We boot a primary partition with a production
classpath. We spawn new partitions with test classpath. We should be able
to spawn many partitions, too.

[Wait just a minute. Is JOS going to be a multiple user operating system,
or not? I hope it is. If JOS is going to be a multiple user operating
system, it must be able to support multiple concurrent partitions/domains
and multiple concurrent classpaths. Security is a very important part of a
partition/domain.

When someone connect to JOS through telnet, a new partition/domain (with a
unique classpath) is created when they log in. The partition/domain
provides a default shell for each user.

When I'm compiling Java code, using the multiple user JOS operating system,
I certainly don't want to bring down the system for all its other users.]

On a large business machine, it might have all these partitions running at
the same time:

prod1
prod2
prod3
test1
test2
test3
test4

On Wiki, these have been called domains and instances of a JVM. When
spawning a partition, you can pass a parameter for Java 1.0, 1.1 or 1.2
platform compatibility.

public class Partition {
  public Partition( Platform v ) {
  :
  }
}

public class Platform {
  public static final Platform JAVA_10 = new Platform( 1.0 );
  public static final Platform JAVA_11 = new Platform( 1.1 );
  public static final Platform JAVA_12 = new Platform( 1.2 );
  private Platform( float v ) {
    platformID = v;
  }
  public getPlatformID() {
    return platformID;
  }
  private float platformID;
}
