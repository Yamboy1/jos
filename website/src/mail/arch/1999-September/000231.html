I see JOS as being defined into three layers: JOSBox, JOSystem,
Applications (including JADE).

JOSBox is the virtual hardware that is the kernel and VM and all that,
once we get that for one architecture we can port it to others without
changing anything else about JOS. It would also be possible to make a
JOS &quot;emulator&quot; that is a kernel's, special, VM/quasiOS that runs on
another OS which would run the same JOS as everything else... The
purpose of the JOSBox is to load JOSystem.

JOSystem is the &quot;real&quot; OS, consisting of a Java &quot;kernel&quot; that loads
drivers and resources and communicates with the hardware using the
JOSBox proxy/abstraction, its purpose is to load the Applications.

the Applications are why we have the OS, JADE is a special application
(a JOS-specific application) that communicates the wants of the user to
the OS via oddly colored boxes and icons that look like tissue boxes. it
translates the user input into commands for the OS.

Separating JOS like this gives it maximum flexibility, by making the UI
an application not part of the OS it makes JOS easy to put on a robot
(you'd need a JOSBox for the microprocessor and an application that had
the program for the robot for that to work mind you). Also, say company
X makes a new type of computer using a new design that makes it
impossible to use other OSes like windows, they code a JOSBox and all
the sudden they have a full OS and everybody's favorite apps already
running. If you have windows but use Java apps alot you could load JOS
with a windows &quot;emulating&quot; JOSBox and you could use JADE alongside
windows (and if you get rid of windows all you need to download is the
kernel's JOSBox...)

Cheers,
DigiGod

	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial

	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
