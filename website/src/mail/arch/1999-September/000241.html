José includes the Master Compiler. It is a translator/interpreter/compiler
based on a plug-in translator architecture. Last year, I have wrote about
30+ plug-ins for the Master Compiler, like ISQL and webfile.

Source code is a digital resource if it is stored somewhere. The Master
Compiler reads source code. It converts all source code into a SourceCode
object. The SourceCode object is passed to a plug-in translator. The
plug-in is run and must throw a CompilerException if it cannot complete the
request.

The SourceCode object has a source URL property and lines property. The
lines property is a container for lines of code. Each line of code has a
text property and an original line number property. The text property
contains the text of the source code. The line number property is important
for symbolic debugging. The original line number is retained even while
source code is passed from one pre-processor to another.

In this architecture, source code is not passed by default as an input
stream. A SourceCode object has a getLineNumberInputStream() method for
those plug-ins that prefer the input stream format.

The role of the Master Compiler itself is to select a plug-in. For
automatic plug-in selection, the name of a plug-in must be stored in the
source code. The plug-in selection statement is a translator directive, and
looks like this:

#class-name

The class with a given class-name must implement a plug-in interface.

The Master Compiler is the first pre-processor, so it is the only component
which has to deal with a source code URI. It uses the smart object factory
to obtain an input stream. Source code can be stored on a local or remote
machine. In other words, you can run a script directly off an HTTP service.
