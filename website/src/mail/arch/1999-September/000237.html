<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm currently unsure about where discussions about JOSSystem are placed, so

its actually JOSystem (we're just accentuating the System to
differentiate it from the other layers...), I've been saying it &quot;Joe
System&quot;.

I don't know how applicable this is, but I was at the MIT &quot;Parallel and
Distributed OS&quot; (or PDOS) page and they were talking about a new design,
called exokernel. its a good idea and its flexible like we need, but I
don't know how well it would translate to a VM based OS, unless we used
it on JOSystem which is, basically, &quot;the kernel on the kernel&quot;, or the
virtual kernel. I think we could get flexibility and speed by using a
nanokernel for the JOSBox and an exokernel for JOSystem. of course I
don't much of such things, so I encourage you to see the site
<A HREF="http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/exo/">http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/exo/</A> and goto
<A HREF="http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/PDOS-papers.html">http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/PDOS-papers.html</A> for more (to much, in fact)
information. at the very least we can use their neat file system...

Cheers,
DigiGod

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
