<PRE>JOS is a free Java-based operating system. The emphasis is

- based upon Java(tm),
- built on top of Java(tm),
- with Java(tm) as its foundation.

Are we building a foundation *for* Java(tm) or building upon Java(tm) as
the foundation? It seems to me that the mechanism to let people use the
software is a higher priority right now than the software itself. Content
is worthless without a mechanism to deliver it.

1. Build JOS(tm) on Java(tm)

How do you take JOS for a test drive? Use an existing sub-operating system
kernel. You can use a kernel from Linux(r) or Windows(tm). You can use an
existing Java(tm) Runtime Environment. By default, that's what everybody is
doing.

Encourage lots of programmers to build the parts of the operating system we
need, using Java(tm), the programming language, and Java(tm), the class
libraries, and Java(tm), the virtual machine.

2. Build Java(tm) on JOS(tm)???

You might use assembler, C, and/or C++ to build a foundation for Java(tm).
Such a sub-operating system would provide a specialized environment for a
specialized JVM.

If JOS(tm) is based upon Java(tm), Java(tm) can't be based on JOS(tm). That
would be a recursive dependency. We don't want a new sub-operating system,
a new JVM, and then new class libraries and applications on top of that.

If the JOS project is going to build a Java-based operating system, it
doesn't need to build a new sub-operating system, at least not on the first
day. A special-interest group within the JOS Project could pursue the new
sub-operating system. That should not be the focus of the JOS Project.
