<PRE>&gt;<i> I see JOS as being defined into three layers: JOSBox, JOSystem,
</I>&gt;<i> Applications (including JADE).
</I>
	Right.  As it stands JOSBox is the JavaOS for Business hardware
APIs (or will be, for jJOS/decaf), and JOSSystem is undefined, pending
design decisions. The JOSBox can't be emulated by a conventional JVM
without some heavy-duty coding, an effort I believe would be much better
spent implementing the JOSBox on hardware (i.e. jJOS/decaf).  The
applications -- including JADE -- could be programmed on a conventional
JVM if you emulated JOSSystem, which is possible, albeit as difficult, if
not more so, than emulating the JOSBox. (Although this approach would
probably entail less manipulation of the VM itself.)  I don't particularly
object to this approach, except that we haven't defined a JOSSystem
(though the exercise of trying to write JADE on Sun's class-library would
probably point out exactly what was missing...) -- which could cause
masssive lossage if we define it differently than it was emulated or if we
define it in some way compromise way so we don't lose the extant body of
work; again, if you are interested in JOSBox/JOSSytem -level coding, it
seems to me to be a good idea to set to work on that now, instead.

	It seems to me, Gilbert, like the architecture group might define
the upper edge of JOSSystem (what abstractions should every JOSBox have?)
and JADE (what will our equivalent of the X libraries look like? Should
they look more like the KDE/GNOME libaries?  (Sun's canonical class
library being the equivalent of glibc.))
