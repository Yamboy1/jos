When I talk about the JOSBox I think of the kernel and the VM, the
JOSBox is a kind of emulator for Java. as far as JOSystem is concerned
its running on pure hardware. I know that's impossible as the two layers
are going to need many hooks between them, Id like to keep all the
machine code in JOSBox, even if that means putting some bytecode in it.
 
&gt;<i> Layer 2: Java API -or- JOS class libraries
</I>&gt;<i> The virtual machine goes hand in hand with the Java class libraries. This
</I>&gt;<i> layer turns a sub-operating system into the Java platform.
</I>
I think you misunderstand me, the class libraries and API's have nothing
to do with this. this layer is the real OS, an all Java &quot;pseudo&quot; kernel
that the JOSBox invocates, the Java device drivers the process managers
and the like. This is the OS in the classic sense, but it needs a
quasiOS in the JOSBox to work...
 
&gt;<i> Layer 3: Applications
</I>&gt;<i> Operating system applications are applications, too. All of the programs
</I>&gt;<i> that come with the operating system are written on top of layer 2. A device
</I>&gt;<i> driver may or may not be an application, depending on where/when it is
</I>&gt;<i> plugged into Layer 1.
</I>
if its part of the OS and its not native its Layer 2. layer 3 isn't the
OS, but what the OS does; JADE is an application because its not part of
the OS, it does no operating what it does do is allow the user to run
applications easily and modify the OS easily. most of layer 3 should be
unaware of JOS.
 
&gt;<i> These layers might be recognized by the instruction set(s) used:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Layer 1 - machine code
</I>&gt;<i> Layer 2 - mixture of bytecode and machine code (for native methods)
</I>&gt;<i> Layer 3 - bytecode
</I>
Id like to keep as much native code as possible in layer 1.
 
&gt;<i> With precision, Layer 1 is markedly machine code from any programming
</I>&gt;<i> language. Remember that even Java, the programming language, can be
</I>&gt;<i> compiled directly into machine code.
</I>
good point.
 
&gt;<i> With precision, Layer 3 is markedly bytecode from any programming language
</I>&gt;<i> that can produce Java-compatible bytecode. Remember that Java, the
</I>&gt;<i> programming language, is not the only programming language that produces
</I>&gt;<i> bytecode.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As much of the system that can be expressed in bytecode should be expressed
</I>&gt;<i> in bytecode. When thousands of programs need to copy (download) a file, the
</I>&gt;<i> bytecode for the copy-one-file class should be shared, not stored once for
</I>&gt;<i> each program. In RAM, the copy-one-file class should exist once, not once
</I>&gt;<i> for each class loader.
</I>
like we have a shared memory that each VM thinks is its own?
 
&gt;<i> How should JOS bytecode be stored? I believe that it must be stored in
</I>&gt;<i> package files in order to achieve software reuse. That's an architecture
</I>&gt;<i> question, isn't it?
</I>
we need to support the .class file, but Id like the libraries in
.package files.

Cheers,
