<PRE>Realign Software is (again) proud to announce José(tm) for Windows(tm), a
special edition version of José(tm) customized for the Microsoft(r)
Windows(tm) sub-operating system. José(tm) runs Apple, Linux(r), Solaris,
OS/2, OS/400, UNIX(tm), and Windows(tm), too.

- This is a run-time distribution; it contains no source code. It is a
non-technical, end-user distribution.

- This is a special edition customized for Windows(tm). It is free-license
software. Even the JRE for Windows is available from JavaSoft at no
addition cost.

- It is available on the Internet. Unzip this file and run the josewin.exe
program.

&lt;URL:<A HREF="http://www.realignsoft.com/jpkg/josewin1a.zip">http://www.realignsoft.com/jpkg/josewin1a.zip</A>&gt;

- It is available on CD-ROM. It runs directly off of CD-ROM without
installation of anything but the JRE. Installation is nothing more than
copying files from CD-ROM to your local drive. This is a perfect
distribution for one-use or occasional-use software.

We will continue to bring José(tm) technology to the JOS(tm) platform. As a
JOS programmer, you might notice that José(tm) uses a custom class manager,
package files, the SmartAPI, the SmartRegistry, the ConsoleStudio. It
includes the Master Editor, Master Compiler, Applet Browser and Plain-Text
Browser.

As a Java programmers, you might be surprised by what's missing. It has no
.class or .jar files! Each Java(tm) package is stored in package file in
order to achieve from extreme software reuse.

Take it for a test drive. Check it out. See if you like it. You don't have
to edit your CLASSPATH or reboot your computer.

- It might be the easiest Windows(tm) software you've ever had to install.
You unzip it and run the josewin.exe program. That's all there is to it. It
is self-contained. The josewin.exe program uses the Java Native Interface
to launch a JVM. It is an end-user program and uses the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE), not a JDK/JSK.

- It might be the easiest Windows(tm) software you've ever had to
un-install. When you're done, you delete it.
