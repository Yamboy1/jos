Well, like I said, to run JADE on Windows you'd need a special VM that's
a JOSBox sans kernel, with the &quot;abstractions every JOSBox should have&quot;
on top of that would be the standard JOSystem running JADE; you'd have
all three layers but the bottom half of the first layer would be resting
on another OS. I don't think it would be possible to run JOSystem on a
&quot;plain&quot; VM as, I assume, it shall need special hooks for things like
creating another VM and communication with other VM's (that will
probably involve equal coding in the JOSBox and JOSystem to work and
probably involve TCP/IP sockets...).

I remember defining a general outline for JOSystem on the Wiki, I think
under JOSystem...

Cheers,

	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
