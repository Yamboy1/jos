Downstream, José(tm) and JOS(tm) should merge. José(tm) has a strong
architecture for extreme reuse. I would like everyone on the archecture
group to experience first hand the architecture of José(tm) so that JOS(tm)
can borrow it, as appropriate.

Everyone should agree that JOS(tm) has three layers. Everyone should agree
to at least three layers, even while we might not agree on their names.
Every classic operating system has had three layers. We should take comfort
from the fact we're not doing anything new here.

These layers are fuzzy, abstract and flexible, and should be. Software is
software. It has been and will always be a matter of convention to put
software in different layers.

Layer 1: kernel -or- JOSBox -or- sub-operating system
The kernel and JOSBox are the same. They are the parts of a complete system
that are below the machine interface. In classic architecture, this layer
is known as the &quot;hardware&quot; layer.

Java, the virtual machine, depends on a sub-operating system. JOSBox,
Linux(r) and Windows(tm) are suitable sub-operating systems, with device
drivers.

Layer 2: Java API -or- JOS class libraries
The virtual machine goes hand in hand with the Java class libraries. This
layer turns a sub-operating system into the Java platform.

Layer 3: Applications
Operating system applications are applications, too. All of the programs
that come with the operating system are written on top of layer 2. A device
driver may or may not be an application, depending on where/when it is
plugged into Layer 1.

These layers might be recognized by the instruction set(s) used:

Layer 1 - machine code
Layer 2 - mixture of bytecode and machine code (for native methods)
Layer 3 - bytecode

With precision, Layer 1 is markedly machine code from any programming
language. Remember that even Java, the programming language, can be
compiled directly into machine code.

With precision, Layer 3 is markedly bytecode from any programming language
that can produce Java-compatible bytecode. Remember that Java, the
programming language, is not the only programming language that produces
bytecode.

As much of the system that can be expressed in bytecode should be expressed
in bytecode. When thousands of programs need to copy (download) a file, the
bytecode for the copy-one-file class should be shared, not stored once for
each program. In RAM, the copy-one-file class should exist once, not once
for each class loader.

How should JOS bytecode be stored? I believe that it must be stored in
package files in order to achieve software reuse. That's an architecture
question, isn't it?
