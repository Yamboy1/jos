<PRE>	JOS is, of course, an operating system.  We intend to write as
much of that operating system as is practicable in Java.  Certain aspects
of any operating system must be specific to the machine on which it is
running.  Sun's Java Virtual Machine is not a machine on which an
operating system can run.  Therefore, we must build our own.  John
Morrison (jJOS) and myself (decaf) believe that the best approach is to
write our own kernel and VM (although not class library) from scratch.
Other proposals include variants based on the Flux OS Toolkit, etc.  I
rejected the idea of a modification to an existing open-source JVM (i.e.
Kaffe) because I felt my resources would be better used in creation and
not modification; there does not appear to be either a benefit in
time-to-product or functionality.  I have found it a pleasure to work with
John's kernel (jJOS), and have no desire to port decaf to a different one.


	If you are interested in writing Java device drivers, or C/C++
kernel or JVM code, please join up on the <A HREF="mailto:kernel@jos.org">kernel@jos.org</A> mailing list;
there's always plenty to do.  If you're not (and I can't fault you!), feel
free to develop aspects of JOS on conventional JVMs; you will, however,
be forced to emulate in several key areas, doing the kind of work I would
imagine someone uninterested in kernel/driver/JVM work would find boring.
If you're interested in testing jJOS/decaf out, the source is in the
'JJOS' module of our CVS server, and you can send question to the kernel
list...
