<PRE>Reflect on this:

public class SystemExit() {
  static() {
    System.exit();
  }
}

What happens when your code reflects this class?

Class c = Class.forName( &quot;SystemExit&quot; );
Method[] c.getMethods();

Your program ends somewhere within the call to Class.forName(). So, how can
you reflect the methods of such a class?

Have you ever wondered why the Java compiler never invokes a static method
when it loads a class? It is because the Java compiler uses a better
reflection API. Here is what reflection *should* do:

1. Reflect without side-effects.

Reflection should be reflection-only. It must not assume the purpose of
reflection is invocation. It must not invoke the static method of a class.

2. Reflect any bytecode.

Reflection should be limitless. It must not assume the target of reflection
is limited to the platform of the current JVM.

In other words, the right kind of reflection package should be able to
reflect the Java 0 and 1 Platforms using a Java 2 Platform JVM. And
likewise, the same package -- without modification -- should be able to
reflect the Java 2 Platform using a Java 0 Platform JVM.

How not to do it
Expanding the responsibilities of java.lang.Class is bad, very bad.
Attaching reflection to the java.lang.Class class limits reflection to a
platform equal to your JVM. The java.lang.Class object has nothing to do
with static reflection.

When java.lang.Class is used for reflection, the static() method is invoked
while building the Class object. It executes bytecode that should not be
executed for the sake of pure reflection.

How must bytecode can you write inside of a static() method?

There is no limit. There is nothing inherent in the static() method from
loading a huge application. You can write a class-specific routine,
following the recommended use of the static() method. Or, you can launch a
thousand sub-programs.

Inside the JVM, the static() method must be invoked just like every other
method. It has the potential to be very large. Before, the static() method
is called, the JVM must update the class object itself to show that the
static() method has been called, so that it cannot be called again for that
instance of a class object.

The static() method must have its own stack frame, just like every other
method. In a multiple thread environment, a static() method is able to
create and start other threads. It must not block other threads. The JVM
cannot afford to wait. It must continue to task-switch while the static()
method is running.

The static() method is *always* synchronized, preventing two or more
threads from using the static() method at the same time. You write:

static() {
  System.out.println( &quot;Hello, World!&quot; );
}

and the compiler writes:

public static synchronized static() {
  System.out.println( &quot;Hello, World!&quot; );
}

[1] public because the JVM must invoke it.
[2] static because it invoked without an instance of the class.
[3] synchronized because it must be invoked once, and only once, as
promised by the JVM.

When does the JVM invoke this method()? It is a matter of semantics. The
JVM usually invokes the static method as an instance of java.lang.Class is
constructed. It must be invoked at some time after a class is resolved and
before any other method is invoked.
