<PRE>Classes required at boot-time are &quot;boot classes&quot;. A boot class must be
loaded before the virtual machine is able to use a custom class loader.

Classes are organized into packages. Packages required at boot-time are
&quot;boot&quot; packages. Classes should be included or excluded from boot-time at
the package level.

In general, there are three ways to think about boot classes.

1. Stored in many, many files. In a classic design, boot classes are loaded
through a primordial class loader. When a classic virtual machine is
&quot;booted&quot; or started up, it depends on a pre-existing file sub-system.
Originally, a CLASSPATH enabled a primordial class loader to load bytecode
from class files.

2. Stored in two files. Continuing to use a primordial class loader, a
CLASSPATH was re-invented to include archive files (.cab, .jar and .zip).
At first, compressed archives were not supported. Later, it was. Again,
CLASSPATH enabled a primordial class loader to load bytecode from class
files stored alone or in an archive. This is basically how decaf works.

3. Stored in one file. A virtual machine and its boot packages can be
stored in a single executable file. Boot packages are statically linked
with a virtual machine, rather than dynamically linked. The two become
inseparable.

There are many reasons why I'd like to store a virtual machine and its boot
packages in a single file. Here are a few.

A. The startup sequence does not depend on a pre-existing file subsystem.
The mechanism for loading or downloading a boot image is encapsulated by
GRUB or Etherboot. No modules are required.

B. Bytecode is binary data. For boot packages, and boot packages only,
bytecode is a binary resource. Like icons and string tables, boot packages
can be statically linked to an executable image.

C. When bytecode is statically linked to an executable image, both Linux
and Windows correctly treat it as read-only. A bytecode resource is never
written to a swap file because it is always available in the original
executable image on disk. When bytecode is translated into a class
definition and then a class, it is not discarded. The space is never freed.
This means that the Code attribute does not have to be copied into a
read-write memory block.

D. When bytecode is statically linked to an executable image, GRUB and
Etherboot correctly tread it as read-only. No additional module is
required. When bytecode is statically linked to decaf, a primordial class
loader can always get the bytecode. It is guaranteed. No CLASSPATH is
required for boot packages.

We are again talking about the same thing in different context. Both a
system-process and a user-process class loader should implement the same
PrimordialClassLoader interface.

A kernel class loader is a kind-of primordial class loader. A kernel class
loader is used to load classes in the system process. It is a
system-process class loader. It loads init.class.

A user-process class loader is a kind-of primordial class loader. A
user-process class loader is used to load classes in a user process.

-----

A kernel class loader might use classes.zip, bytecode resources, or some
other method. It might depend on CLASSPATH or it might ignore it. It always
loads a system process. It exists before a file subsystem.

On the other hand, a user-process class loader may or may not depend on
CLASSPATH. CLASSPATH exists only for backward compatibility.

Here's a decaf scenario.

1. A virtual machine is loaded as an executable image.
2. The classes.zip archive is loaded as a module.
3. A kernel class loader is used to boot-strap the system process.
4. At least the java.lang, java.io, java.net and java.util packages are
available in classes.zip.

(Up to this point, nothing has changed.)

4. The init class loads a URL-based class loader, also stored in classes.zip.
5. The init class uses the URL-based class loader to download an
implementation of some file subsystem.
6. Many more class files, archives and package files become available
through the new file subsystem.
7. The init class launches a Java application, inside a new process, with a
new CLASSPATH and a new primordial class loader that uses CLASSPATH.
8. The Java application runs unaware that it is running on decaf. It is
unaware how it runs side-by-side with other processes.

A command line shell might be the second process. It could be a standard
Java application. The shell and the system process (init) are isolated from
each other by the process model.

In turn, the command line shell can display a list of current processes,
change the DIRECTORY, CLASSPATH and PACKAGEPATH environment variables,
launch a new process, kill a process, redirect the output from one
application to the input of another.

-----

How should they be linked? There are two good ways to do this.

1. Boot packages can be stored in an archive (like classes.zip) and the
archive concatinated to the virtual machine's executable image. A kernel
class loader would find the archive just like it finds any binary resource.

2. Boot packages can be compiled into a static library. Binary resources
can be stored in C++ source code using a code generator. By compiling the
C++ code and using a standard linker, boot package resources can be stored
in a static library.

Personally, I like method 2 for at least the following reason. When binary
resources are stored in C++ source code, they become C++ classes. The C++
class design enables an abstraction of a resource. It is no longer a raw
binary resource from the viewpoint of all the other classes. I have been
working on a translator. It does work. I have documented this on JOS Wiki,
in an article called BytecodeResource.
