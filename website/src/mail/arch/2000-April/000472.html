Correct. There is one thing I forgot to mention in my last email,
though. Because of the way I have loaded te classes, the per process
System class will only be used if the caller class was loaded in the
process's class loader. Because programs usually call
System.out.println() directly, effectively this works virtually all the
time. However, if you call a method on another class loaded by the
primordial class loader, and it invokes System.out.println(), it will
resolve to the &quot;real&quot; System class ignoring any changes you've made to
your process's System.out variable(*). I think this is a very minor
point though, especialy since the host version doesn't care if it
doesn't work 0.001% of the time. The native version should.

(*) Actually, System.out is defined in the spec to be a final but I
redefined it as a variable so I don't need a native method to set it.
Programs won't exploit this however since they will be compiled against
the &quot;real&quot; version of System.
