Agreed.

Yes, but often not to initialise it. Objects have constructors partly
because it enables internals to be set in a way that is impossible after
the object is constructed. A similar effect can be achieved for static
classes.

&gt;<i> &gt; When a ProcessClassLoader loads a class (eg. when findSystemClass() is

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
In rheise.os, the primordial class loader of a process is called a
ProcessClassLoader. Does that mean we agree?

&gt;<i> 	The kernel classloader could be just about anything -- the first
</I>&gt;<i> native primordial classloader to be created; a specific class that uses
</I>&gt;<i> the ramdisk generated by the bootloader; a specific class that uses
</I>&gt;<i> Gilbert's rater intriguing DATA-section bytecode resource; and so
</I>&gt;<i> on.  Since each process has a primordial classloader, and the primordial
</I>&gt;<i> classloaders are all generated by code we control, we can simply insert
</I>&gt;<i> the necessary shares before handing the classloader back to the Java
</I>&gt;<i> program. 
</I>
Are you implying that each ProcessClassLoader has its own class
definition cache? Can you explain how this works?

&gt;<i> &gt; So, it is important that even if a process's class loader is natively
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generated, there is still a reference to it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	I agree.  I was suggesting that native generation could sidestep
</I>&gt;<i> some problems with doing the code in Java, create the native primordial
</I>&gt;<i> classloader and assign the JP PCL reference to it.
</I>
Ok. I'd still like to maintain the Java implementation in case it proves
to be useful in the end.
