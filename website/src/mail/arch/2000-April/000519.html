<PRE>&gt;<i> Exactly! Earlier, I offered an equivalent example in the Java programming
</I>&gt;<i> language and used bytecode instead of class definition. Bytecode and class
</I>&gt;<i> definition are the same thing.
</I>
	Well, from here in the JVM trenches, they're not, but yeah, I
think I see where you were coming from.

&gt;<i> Class definitions (or bytecode) can be intern'd. If the primordial class
</I>&gt;<i> loader is the only class loader that can intern a class definition,
</I>&gt;<i> checking for equal class loaders is redundent. An object can be shared if
</I>&gt;<i> its class definition is the same.
</I>
	I thought there was a hole in this somewhere when I coded the
example, but I may be wrong.  (That is, since pointers to class
definitions vary between classloaders, they carry information equivalent
to both...)  I'll think about this some more.

&gt;<i> If a primordial class loader is written in bytecode, it needs to intern
</I>&gt;<i> class definitions too. Any class definition could be intern'd by any class
</I>&gt;<i> loader. If both primordial and custom class loaders can intern a class
</I>&gt;<i> definition, an object can be shared if its class definition is the same.
</I>
	No.  A custom classloader which does not use findSystemClass() (or
equivalent, e.g. asking a process-wide static for a Class) can not share
definitions with another custom classloader.  The semantics of the VM
require that those classes be considered different, and to do otherwise is
not transparent to 'legacy' applications which use custom
classloaders.  If a custom classloader passes on a Class from somewhere
else in the same process, naturally the Class is the same in both
classloaders, and casting is allowed.  (According to my recollection of
the spec.)

&gt;<i> I'm pretty sure I cannot make use of an operating system that exclusively
</I>&gt;<i> intern's system classes. Most of the reusable classes in my applications
</I>&gt;<i> are /not/ system classes. JEPS, JADE and JSDK and other javax.* packages
</I>&gt;<i> are big; but, they are /not/ system classes. Even their class definitions
</I>&gt;<i> should be intern'd.
</I>
	Yes, the should be, but in order to make sure that their sharing
is transparent, they must be loaded by a primordial loader.  However,
there is not, to my understanding, a limitation on how the class
definition gets into the primordial loader.  You have pointed out that a
bytecode primordial loader ought to be possible; it would then be
relatively easy to perform whatever non-mounted-fs method you want in
order to generate class definitions.  If we could define a special variety
of custom classloaders that could be used to generate class definitions to
hand off to a primordial loader, than we /may/ be able to do shares that
way.  But I think this is a complexity that can be handled later.
