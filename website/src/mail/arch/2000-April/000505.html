The System wrapper class is required to prevent one process from writing
over the System.in that is being used by another process.

Echidna does as you are saying but it suffers from the flaw I'm pointing
out: System.setIn() stuffs everything up, and we must support it.
Echidna provides a non-standard api for setting System.in to avoid the
problem but this means standard Java programs that attempt to call
System.setIn() will stuff up the system (all processes will suddenly
start reading from the single stdin that was just set).

&gt;<i> splitting it up ought to be more
</I>&gt;<i> efficient, right?
</I>
I'm not exactly sure what you're referring to here. rheise.os uses two
methods where one is a fallback. The one that is used 99% of the time is
the System wrapper class ,which is the most efficient method because it
doesn't do any forwarding. The fallback method is less efficient because
it must determine the current process and forward on the request to
where it was /meant/ to go, but it is necessary to cover the remaining
1% (*).

(*) As I noted earlier, it doesn't actually cover all of the remaining
1% but most of it. There is a chance something could go wrong, but it
might be that there is no &quot;system code&quot; that causes this to happen, so
we're ok. I can deal with it when/if it happens, but the &quot;host&quot;
implementation isn't really meant to be perfect anyway - in fact it
can't be. The &quot;nativ&quot; implementation will be able to handle these
problems, however.
