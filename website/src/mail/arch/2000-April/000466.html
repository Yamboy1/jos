<PRE>&gt;<i> look at it slowly.  The objective of threading is to share memory between
</I>&gt;<i> processes, basically.  So why would separate processes need or want to
</I>&gt;<i> share memory?  You never /need/ to share objects, because anything you can
</I>&gt;<i> program with shared memory, you can likewise program with message-passing.  
</I>&gt;<i> (And vice-versa, actually.)  So you must want to share objects for
</I>&gt;<i> efficiency -- but if the two process are pieces of the same program, why
</I>&gt;<i> aren't they threads?  The only reasonable answer is efficiency between
</I>&gt;<i> separate programs.

There may be another reason, depending on how one implements security. There
is often a need for an appliction to switch identity before running a piece
of code. The perfect example would be a web server. CGI scripts are usually
executed &quot;as&quot; the user who owns the file (but the equivalent is not possible
with servlets and JavaServer Pages using todays JVMs).

A Java based operating system should probably provide an API through which
applications can assume the identity of a user (provided that the &quot;current&quot;
user has sufficient access to do so).

When writing a Java application, one wants it to run on any JVM - not just
on JOS. This means that the code the switches identity will (in many cases)
have to be the only JOS-specific code. If sharing of objects across
processes is possible, the rest of the code (in the web server, or whatever
it is) could access data just as if it was just another thread - with the
difference that it's actually a process. In a conventional JVM, it would
indeed be a thread.

Not many would implement an IPC-by-serialization technique just to make it
run on JOS. This would, however, be required to achieve proper handling of
security on JOS, while at the same time making the application run in a
conventional JVM.

This assumes that the security model doesn't allow for a thread to be owned
by another user than other threads in the same process. If this would be
possible to implement, it would probably be a better solution (IMHO).

If I'm missing something blatantly obvious, please forgive me.
