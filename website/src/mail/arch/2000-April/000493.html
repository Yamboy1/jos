<PRE>&gt;<i> I disagree. There must be two mechanisms. The getCurrentProcess() method
</I>&gt;<i> returns the current process -- regardless of who owns the code. The
</I>&gt;<i> getProcess() method returns the process that owns an object. While
</I>&gt;<i> getCurrentProcess() probably uses getCurrentThread(), getProcess() probably
</I>&gt;<i> uses getClass().getClassLoader().
</I>
	I'll second this.  If we allow multiple-process objects, there
could be code that could be running in a process other than its nominal
owner.


	Considering the AWT: the AWT is only an interface.  How we choose
to implement it is completely up to us.  Current AWT implementations must
use native peers because the windowing system, graphics libraries, etc,
aren't written in Java.  This will not be the case for JOS.  I rather like
the idea of translating all AWT calls into Swing calls, so that we can
skin legacy apps -- but more importantly, we only have one library to
write support for.  (That is, the AWT peers could be BCNI redirectors to
Swing.)  Swing, in turn, could get its JDesktop analouge from the virtual
console driver.

	My point here is that we don't have to, and in fact, don't want,
native peers, and that this puts a different slant on things.  JADE, in
fact, may /be/ the toolkit.  If our toolkit code is written to always ask
the X-server analouge process for instances of widgets (etc), than the
number of shares is just the number of widgets, because the widgets and
their code all reside in the process the toolkit code is using as its
backend.

	(I think that made sense.)

&gt;<i> If there is more than one instance of JADE, only one instance of JADE can
</I>&gt;<i> be visible at a time in full screen mode. There may be special key
</I>&gt;<i> combinations or mouse events to switch between virtual consoles.
</I>
	There already are special key combinations to switch between
virtual consoles :)  (ALT-Fx)
