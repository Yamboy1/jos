I think they do something with statics, but I don't remember for sure.

&gt;<i> 	Section 5.3.4 of the JVM spec explicitly states that no two

</I>&gt;<i> essential that any type name N mentioned in the field or method descriptor
</I>&gt;<i> denote the same class or interface when loaded by L1 and when loaded by
</I>&gt;<i> L2.&quot;
</I>
Only if, for example, class A (L1) tries to pass a variable of type N
into a method of class B (L2) - anything where N is mentioned in the
field or method descriptor. If it is not, then it is quite possible for
two classloaders to define the same class differently.

Actually, the terminology is a bit tricky here. What I mean is, it is
possible to define two classes of the same type differently in two
different classloaders on the condition described above. And to modify
your original statement, no two classloaders may attempt to define the
same class at all (I should think).

&gt;<i> 	The issue of type-safety (and correctness!) /requires/ that
</I>&gt;<i> processes which wish to share Java objects either via direct references or
</I>&gt;<i> via the Serializable interface share class definitions for the shared
</I>&gt;<i> objects' classes /and every class referenced in its resolution/.
</I>
Ideally, you want to limit access to another process's objects to &quot;as
much as is required and no more&quot;. This could be a matter of programming
style. When message passing between processes, the arguments and return
values can be of simple Classes intended only to carry data.

&gt;<i>  This is
</I>&gt;<i> where you begin to want finer control over what classes your child process

</I>&gt;<i> for these, the default ought to be to share everything else, with the
</I>&gt;<i> application specifically mentioning the exceptions -- e.g. classes it
</I>&gt;<i> loaded which have statics.
</I>
Hmm, I see your goal is to minimise memory consumption, but this sounds
like a security risk. If an application must specifically mention which
classes should be protected, that leaves existing Java applications open
to security holes. Ignoring memory for the moment, it seems to me that
the default should be to share nothing apart from what is explicitly
requested.

As for memory saving, a solution might be:

- share classes which are loaded from the same version of the same
  archive
- always maintain separate statics for different classloaders

Note that we will effectively have a primordial classloader for every
process, each under the control of the JVM. Since nearly every class
will be loaded by one of these classloaders, the JVM can check if they
are coming from the same archive.

When might they come from different archives? If you change your
CLASSPATH in a particular shell. If you are a programmer, you will
likely have many different versions of the same class on your system and
you would like to be able to run each one, potentially all at the same
time. The JVM can't just assume that it can share the same
implementation of the class among each process.

Just as well the JVM allows you to define the same class differently in
different classloaders! (see my clarification of section 5.3.4 of the
JVM spec, above)

(Note, I hope I'm not way out of context since I entered this thread
late :-)
