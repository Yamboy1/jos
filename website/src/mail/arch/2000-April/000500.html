<PRE>&gt;<i> As promised, here is my response to _Quinn's final summary. Nice,
</I>&gt;<i> thorough summary. I only have a couple of comments:
</I>
	Thanks for the review.

&gt;<i> Shared-object IPC might be more important from a functional perspective.
</I>&gt;<i> rheise.os demonstrates that JavaProcess objects must be shared (although
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure there are hacky ways around this).
</I>
	D'oh!  I'd clean forgotten that we needed shared objects for
rheise.os.  How about:

&quot;The desire for multiple processes ... benefits.  Most elegant
implentations of multiple processes requires shared-object IPC, if for
nothing aside from the created process object.  (Strictly, the process
object returned to the creating function could be a message-passing stub,
like RMI.)&quot;

&gt;<i> Rather than perfecting memory efficiency, then implementing IPC, we
</I>&gt;<i> could start with incomplete implementations of each one and work from
</I>&gt;<i> there. eg. allow IPC for &quot;kernel required&quot; classes (regardless of
</I>&gt;<i> whether memory efficiency is implemented).
</I>
	Right.  I'll see how things turn out in implementation.  (It may
be easier to do both at the same time.)

&gt;<i> - I think the mechanism for (1) needs to be investigated further.
</I>&gt;<i>   Flagging the object is one way to handle it. Another way is to simply
</I>&gt;<i> control &quot;access&quot; to the object. A process can't ordinarily gain access to
</I>&gt;<i> an object in another process, so there needs to be some bridge method
</I>&gt;<i> that returns a reference to an object of another process. This method
</I>&gt;<i> can perform access control. The difficulty in flagging is that you can't
</I>&gt;<i> simply flag an object as shared because that won't give you access to
</I>&gt;<i> its member variables, or to objects returned by methods on the object
</I>&gt;<i> you do have access to. Flagging is obviously a way to make the system
</I>&gt;<i> safer, but is it really necessary?
</I>
	Flagging was my suggestiong for an implementation of (1).  With a
bridge method, once the object has been returned, how does decaf know it
can be 'illegally' cast?  Something about that object in particular is
different than other object -- so I suggested a flag.  Where/when that
flag -- that something special about an object that says 'I'm shared, cast
me illegally' -- is set is mostly an interface issue.

&gt;<i> - The model of sharing here is not fully specified.
</I>
	Good point.  Any shared object may generate additional objects
which must be shared.  According to the summary so far, a security check
is necessary before objects may be shared.  Naturally, this must apply to
objects returned by the shared object as well.  I think the same arguments
apply here as they did before; we don't want to do this implicitly.  That
is, by default, a shared object generates objects belonging to the
classloader to which the constant class reference used loaded -- that is,
when decaf goes to look for a class instance to generate an object from,
it will (perhaps implicitly) use that classloader of the current
thread.  I think forcing the shares to be explicit and having generated
objects be local will take car of the cases we need to worry about.

&gt;<i> &quot;Now, if the client process directly accesses static members, it will
</I>&gt;<i> access the cloned versions that belong to its own process. However, if
</I>&gt;<i> you call a method on an object that really belongs to another process,
</I>&gt;<i> and that method accesses a static member, then it should access the
</I>&gt;<i> static members of the class in the _other_process. Are there any
</I>&gt;<i> problems in implementing that?&quot;
</I>
	I think it comes out implicitly in the way things are done by the
interpreter.  The shared object's class references will be resolved in/by
the classloader which loaded it first, because the CL of an object
(actually, of its class definition) is never changed.  This should be an
exact fit for the ownership semantics.  This also means, incidentally,
that a process that exits can't be cleaned up until we're sure no shared
object classloaders point at it.  (That is, we have to run a garbage
collection on process exit.)

	I'll think about how to add this to the summary.

&gt;<i> Can you point me to these papers? Thanks.

	<A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/">http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/</A>  has a great deal of information
about various problems with Java, including the memory model and
type-safety.  (esp see his paper from the ACM Java Grande conference)

BTW, I put the corrected summary up on the wiki, MultipleJavaProcesses
(<A HREF="http://www.metamech.com/wiki/view/Main/MultipleJavaProcesses">http://www.metamech.com/wiki/view/Main/MultipleJavaProcesses</A>), so that we
can work on it more collaboratively, should we need to.
