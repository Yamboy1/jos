This is exactly right. We need one primordial class loader for each process.

For more information, see also ProcessAndPrimordialClassLoader on JOS Wiki.

The JNI design provides a primordial class loader for each bytecode
process. It also provides one garbage collector, one finalizer thread, one
user interface thread for each bytecode process. It does this by creating a
new instance of an entire virtual machine. A new instance of an entire
virtual machine is not required. Only a new instance of the primordial
class loader is required.

A. Through private property of a class, a primordial class loader could be
100% internal to a virtual machine. For perfect compatibility, the
getClassLoader() method can still return null at the bytecode level. While
we know an application is running in a separate process, this does not need
to be explained to the application.

B. Actually, process ID could become a private property of an instance of
java.lang.Class. When a new instance of systemprocess (in C++) is created,
it gets a system-wide unique ID. Every class created by that process is
tagged as part of that process. The getCurrentProcess() method uses the
private property of a class to return a SystemProcess (in bytecode), a
proxy for systemprocess.

&gt;<i>A process's primordial class loader will always load classes which
</I>&gt;<i>represent class files found in its CLASSPATH.
</I>
A conventional primordial class loader uses CLASSPATH. CLASSPATH depends on
a file subsystem. In the startup sequence, the primordial class loader must
be available /before/ the file subsystem is installed.

The ERIC Project proves that CLASSPATH is not required. Its custom class
loader never uses CLASSPATH. It uses a &quot;package&quot; path. It loads classes
from the local file subsystem. It downloads bytecode from an HTTP service.
It downloads package files. It could download .jars. It could download
.class files.

Absolutely. I am strongly recommending a byte-by-byte comparision on each
class file. The machine code version of memncmp() is not expensive when
compared to the large quanitity of wasted resources cause by duplication of
bytecode.

1. This optimization would help all class loaders across the board. It
would help our own primordial class loader and all user-defined custom
class loaders.

2. The alternative is, well, exactly what I already have. I don't want more
of what I already have. The alternative lends itself to the same
mismanagement of resources as a conventional virtual machine on a foreign
operating system.

A. Through the public ClassLoader property of a class, a primordial class
loader could be (1) implemented in bytecode, (2) extendable, and (3)
customizable. It would not be perfectly compatible because the
getClassLoader() method can still return a primordial class loader at the
bytecode level. An application could easily determine if it was running in
a multiple process virtual machine:

  public void example() {
    if ( System.getClass().getClassLoader() == null ) {
      println( &quot;Running in a conventional virtual machine.&quot; );
    }

    println( &quot;Running in an alternative virtual machine.&quot; );
  }

B. Process (or process ID) becomes a public property of
PrimordialClassLoader. PrimordialClassLoader is a class derived from
java.lang.ClassLoader. It is likely that PrimordialClassLoader has native
methods, too. When a new instance of systemprocess (in C++) is created, it
gets a system-wide unique ID. All instances of systemprocess are &quot;owned&quot; by
the virtual machine. Every class created by that process is tagged as part
of that process. The getCurrentProcess() method uses the public property of
the class loader for a class to return a SystemProcess (in bytecode), a
proxy for systemprocess.

  public Process getCurrentProcess() {
    Object o = this;
    for (;;) {
      ClassLoader loader = o.getClassLoader();
      if ( loader instanceof PrimordialClassLoader ) {
        return ((PrimordialClassLoader) loader).getProcess();
      }
      o = loader;
    }
  }

No matter how many custom class loaders are creating classes, eventually
the above method has to find a primordial class loader. The virtual machine
creates a primordial class loader /first/ before loading anything else.

-----

I agree with the work of Avery Regier. Avery wrote a number of articles on
JOS Wiki, such as WhyMultiProcessJVM. Here is a quote:

&quot;With this type of VM, you can load a single version of a class's bytecodes
into memory once and share the bytecodes amongst all of the processes. Each
process will need its own stack and static variables (otherwise they would
conflict with each other) but bytecodes can be shared.&quot;

3. If a getBytecode() method were able to return bytecode for a class, here
is how a virtual machine can test the compatibility of two arbitrary
classes for class conversion:

  public boolean isCompatible( Class x, Class y ) {
    /* *L!
    if ( x.getBytecode() == y.getBytecode() ) {
      return true;
    }
    else {
      return false;
    }
    */
    return ( x.getBytecode() == y.getBytecode() );
  }

Once bytecode has been intern'd, all compatible classes have an object
reference to exactly the same bytecode. If the bytecode is an exact match,
it does not matter where the bytecode came from. An object can be copied
from one process to another.

4. Possibly, the worst way to convert a raw class file to java.lang.Class
is by using the equivalent of an input stream. That's why the pure
reflection API does not use an input stream to parse a bytecode. Again from
the bottom up: (1) pure reflection comes before bytecode verification; (2)
bytecode verification comes before a bytecode interpreter; and (3) a
bytecode interpreter comes before a virtual machine.
