<PRE>&gt;<i> However, the KernelClassLoader proposed in one of my recent emails would
</I>&gt;<i> have to be native, now that I think about it. Or maybe not. hmm...
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, it would be a big plus to be able to use Java to implement the
</I>&gt;<i> primordial class loader's responsibilities, particularly class
</I>&gt;<i> definition sharing and reading classes from the CLASSPATH.
</I>
	OK -- /I/ think doing it natively will be easier, if for no other
reason than we'll be /sure/ that the problems with it aren't in the
Java/native interface we'd be simultaneously debugging.  OTOH, it is a
design goal to have as much Java as possible, and it will be possible to
have a Java primordial classloader once we dispense with the
bootstrap.  And yes, the boostrap will have to be native.  I happen to
disagree with your implementation; both current boot mechanisms provide a
way -- that we don't have to maintain! -- to load the classfile into RAM
somewhere, and the ramdisk code is well set up already.  We load stuff
with the current code (more or less) until we can hand off to the Java
loader.  That loader, in turn, is responsible for bootstrapping a
filesystem; it will be handed the ramdisk pointer and free that RAM once
it has successfully loaded classes from the filesystem.  (and/or we/it
could mount the ramdisk as a fs until it mounts the real one, and then
unmount, which would free it for us.  whatever.)
