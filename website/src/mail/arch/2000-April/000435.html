<PRE>&gt;<i> findSystemClass() isn't just called to save memory. You *must* call
</I>&gt;<i> findSystemClass() on all the linked classes which are to be referenced
</I>&gt;<i> by the calling code.
</I>
	If they were referenced by the calling code /before/ the call to
the classloader, they've already been loaded; otherwise, this is the first
time they've been loaded for the calling code, and whatever you define it
as is 'right' -- although, as in your applet example, useless.

&gt;<i> You cannot cast the return value of newInstance() from
</I>&gt;<i> Applet(L2) to Applet(L1). You must ensure that Applet in each case is
</I>&gt;<i> the *same* class.
</I>
	Until that Applet(L2) is passed to a method (or assigned to a
field) that knows about Applet(L1), we're good.  It is not required, to my
understanding, that a classloader be /useful/.

	A native extension that would both allow efficient 'illegal' casts
and efficient memory usage would be, then, an assignClassLoader( Class c,
ClassLoader cl) method.  The JOS default custom classloader could use
findSystemClass to locate the (shared) class definition, and the
assignClassLoader() method to 'clone' it, marking it as a separate class
(and generating its independent statics) but flagging it as identical to
the system class for the 'illegal' casts.

&gt;<i> Also, when you consider that it is a security risk to allow user defined
</I>&gt;<i> classes to invoke native system methods (eg. you could bypass the
</I>&gt;<i> sandbox), various system classes (eg. System) must always be loaded by
</I>&gt;<i> the(/a) primordial class loader in order to make use of their native
</I>&gt;<i> methods. Of course, in JOS we might have an effective primordial class
</I>&gt;<i> loader for each process, so it's ok to reload the System class in each
</I>&gt;<i> primordial (JOS-controlled) classloader.
</I>
	Right.  Classes which, for whatever reason, the Java code is
prevented from reloading must be reloaded by the native code; and it /is/
a good idea to restrict access to certain (specified) members of the (JOS)
class library.  (This would probably be better cast as a security issues
-- e.g. only code with an effective uid of root can call (native) method
N, but security is a while off...)

&gt;<i> Ideally, separate namespaces should be completely separate, apart from
</I>&gt;<i> the classes we *want* to share. Would it be possible to provide a native
</I>&gt;<i> method to invoke a program in a new process without requiring any
</I>&gt;<i> classes to be in common? It seems that all it needs to do is convert
</I>&gt;<i> the String array argument from String(L1) to String(L2). This would seem
</I>&gt;<i> safe given that L1 and L2 are primordial class loaders for process 1 and
</I>&gt;<i> process 2, and String is a system class.
</I>
	Yes.  (Of course, it would need a separate Object, as well.)

&gt;<i> I suspect this won't work (see above) - at least not in a normal JVM.
</I>
	The empirical test I described in the last email generated a log
of loaded class that included java.lang.System; whether or not I can
redefine it for long enough to be useful is another question entirely...

&gt;<i> Yes, it is definately useful. I hope the &quot;approved illegal casts&quot; idea
</I>&gt;<i> is a way to solve this.
</I>
	I think it could be; implementation is an issue, but it always
is. See my above assignClassLoader() idea for a way of doing this and
saving memory at the same time.

	BTW, thanks for the smart feedback.
