One of the main changes in this release is that the manager classes are
now purely static, meaning you can call ProcessManager.createProcess()
instead of ProcessManager.get().createProcess(). This also means I had
to include a compatible version of SwingToolkit in this release
(contrary to what I said I would do).

All implementation specific classes have been moved out of the main
public packages and into rheise.os.impl. So, for example,
rheise.os.process only contains classes that application developers
might wish to use. This is similar to how java.* only contains classes
application developers might use, and sun.* contains their private
implementation classes.

I would imagine that if rheise.os.* is renamed to jos.*, we could have
jos.process.ProcessManager, and
org.jos.process.host.HostProcessManagerImpl. This implies that
application developers should never use the org.jos package. I realise
that the JOS project has already agreed on the exact opposite, but this
seems to make more sense to me so I thought I'd raise the issue again.
Thoughts?

But back to the release, here is the latest changelog entry:

        - JavaProcess is now a subclass of java.lang.Process.
        - Made managers static (ie. no need to call ProcessManager.get())
        - Split managers into xxxManager and xxxManagerImpl.
        - Moved implementation specific classes to rheise.os.impl.*
        - BaseJavaProcess maintains process state.
        - Processes are now cleaned up properly when they terminate.
        - Renamed kill() to destroy()
        - Added unit tests.
        - Added comments!!! Well, for process.* anyway.

Enjoy.
