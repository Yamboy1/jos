<PRE>As promised, here is my response to _Quinn's final summary. Nice,
thorough summary. I only have a couple of comments:

On Wed, 19 Apr 2000, Todd L. Miller wrote:

&gt;<i> another.)  The desire for multiple Java processes in a single JVM stems

</I>&gt;<i> more secondary concern is the handling of shared-object IPC.
</I>
Shared-object IPC might be more important from a functional perspective.
rheise.os demonstrates that JavaProcess objects must be shared (although
I'm sure there are hacky ways around this). Rather than perfecting
memory efficiency, then implementing IPC, we could start with incomplete
implementations of each one and work from there. eg. allow IPC for
&quot;kernel required&quot; classes (regardless of whether memory efficiency is
implemented).

&gt;<i> our own.  The key realization for shared-memory OO-IPC is that the
</I>&gt;<i> classloaders, being disjoint, do not share classes, and thus, the object
</I>&gt;<i> can not be cast from one process to another.  We solve this by allowing
</I>&gt;<i> 'illegal' cast operations as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (1) The security system must OK the object share.  This allows us to flag
</I>&gt;<i> 	the object as shared for efficiency.
</I>&gt;<i> (2) The object's class definition must be shared between the two
</I>&gt;<i> 	processes.  (Implying it was loaded by a (native)** primordial
</I>&gt;<i> 	classloader.)
</I>
- I think the mechanism for (1) needs to be investigated further.
  Flagging the object is one way to handle it. Another way is to simply
control &quot;access&quot; to the object. A process can't ordinarily gain access to
an object in another process, so there needs to be some bridge method
that returns a reference to an object of another process. This method
can perform access control. The difficulty in flagging is that you can't
simply flag an object as shared because that won't give you access to
its member variables, or to objects returned by methods on the object
you do have access to. Flagging is obviously a way to make the system
safer, but is it really necessary?

- The model of sharing here is not fully specified. In particular, with
  regard to access to static member variables of shared objects. In a
past email (<A HREF="http://www.jos.org/pipermail/arch/2000-April/000438.html">http://www.jos.org/pipermail/arch/2000-April/000438.html</A>) I
proposed:

&quot;Now, if the client process directly accesses static members, it will
access the cloned versions that belong to its own process. However, if
you call a method on an object that really belongs to another process,
and that method accesses a static member, then it should access the
static members of the class in the _other_process. Are there any
problems in implementing that?&quot;

&gt;<i> * Amusingly enough, Java isn't type-safe anyway.  I don't have the
</I>&gt;<i> (academic) citations handy, unfortunately.
</I>
You might be referring to this:

	<A HREF="http://www.research.att.com/~vj/bug.html">http://www.research.att.com/~vj/bug.html</A>

I think Sun has resolved this problem in JDK 1.2:

	<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/people/gbracha/classloaders.ps">http://java.sun.com/people/gbracha/classloaders.ps</A>

It introduces new loader constraints, which I think are getting in the
way of rheise.os working with JDK 1.2. I haven't looked at this yet (I'm
in no rush either since I'm not using JDK 1.2 :-)

&gt;<i> Likewise, Java's memory model
</I>&gt;<i> -- which I'm mostly ignoring, in part because of this -- is horribly
</I>&gt;<i> broken.  Bill Pugh, who's written some papers about it, seems to hold the
</I>&gt;<i> opinion (based on my second-hand information) that Sun's VM implementation
</I>&gt;<i> has a memory model which makes sense but doesn't follow the spec...
</I>
Can you point me to these papers? Thanks.
