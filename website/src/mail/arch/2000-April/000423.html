<PRE>Many applications use the URL class. The URL class can always benefit from
an automatic URL cache.

1. Every virtual machine should use a system-wide URL cache.

If I have 100 virtual machines, I only want one cache. It should be a
system-wide cache. Even if all 100 virtual machines put in a request for
the same page at the same time, the URL cache would download the resource
only once.

I don't want a URL cache limited to my web browser. Applets aren't the only
Java program that uses a URL class. If that requires a virtual machine
provides a HTTP proxy, that sounds like a good idea.

If it were implemented as a HTTP proxy service, there would only be one
HTTP proxy service listening on a specific TCP port. Each virtual machine
might automatically start an HTTP proxy service (in a separate process) if
there is no response from the TCP port. Rather than modifying each
application to use the proxy service, the virtual machine must redirect
URLs to the HTTP proxy service automatically.

The HTTP proxy itself should use a different implementation of
java.net.URL. Otherwise, the HTTP proxy would become recursive.

This is what we're experimenting with inside the Alt Package project.
Imagine there is a real URL class called alt.resource.URL, an HTTP proxy
would use it to download documents from a real HTTP service. Imagine there
is java.net.URL class that always connects to the HTTP proxy service. The
HTTP proxy service maintains its own URL cache. By refining the
java.net.URL class, every program benefits from a system-wide URL cache.

When there is only one virtual machine, like Ultimate JOS, there might be
no machine code methods bound to java.net.URL.

2. Downloading class, package or jar files from a HTTP service should be
optimized with a URL cache.

The URL-aware class loader benefits automatically from a system-wide URL
cache. When a class file is already in the URL cache, a HTTP proxy does not
have to download it again -- unless the file has changed on the real HTTP
service.

I was thinking about priority. Does a virtual machine need a URL cache more
than it needs a bytecode cache? I think a URL cache comes first. A URL
cache can excellerate all kinds of applications that use a URL. A bytecode
cache should depend on a pre-existing URL cache. A bytecode cache should
use a URL cache to download additional bytecode.

A fully optimized bytecode cache could compile each package ahead of time
into a machine code shared library. A virtual machine doesn't need a
bytecode interpreter after all.

3. I want the benefit of a URL cache without rewriting any Java application.

My applications create the same URLs. They always point to the real HTTP
service. But within the virtual machine, URL *always* go to the system-wide
URL cache. The URL cache should be enabled by default. It might take a
command line parameter to turn it off.
