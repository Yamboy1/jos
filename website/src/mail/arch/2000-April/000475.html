I don't think so. Swing is an add-on for JDK 1.1, whereas it is a part
of JDK 1.2.

Correct. Sort of like the optional envp argument to exec() on UNIX.

</I>
No, that line is not necessary - it returns exactly the same instance in
this case. The line is present just for the sake of consistency - the
process manager is always obtained through the get() method before it is
used. I can remove it if you think it's misleading (or maybe I could
even put a comment in!!! :-)

&gt;<i>         The 'nativ' stuff doesn't ever seem to touch System -- is this

</I>
No, it's incomplete because we have not yet written our JOS version of
the System class. This native implementation of java.lang.System needs
to provide a way to be initialised and I cannot initialise the System
class in the new process unless I know how to initialise it. Since I
wrote the java.lang.System class for the host implementation, I know how
to initialise it.

This is one of the things we need to do to hook up rheise.os to the JOS
kernel. We need to grab CLASSPATH and add all the support it needs to
work with JOS. Then we can modify NativeJavaProcess to make use of this
support.

&gt;<i>         Is this summary correct?  rheise.os needs two things from the
</I>&gt;<i> native code before we can call it jos.os -- a completely empty classloader
</I>&gt;<i> so that code can't call classes loaded in the primordial classloader and
</I>&gt;<i> thereby bypass our rewriting of the statics;
</I>
This is how the NativeProcessClassLoader is at the moment. There are
other native specific ProcessClassLoader issues which I'll need your
help to solve:

NativeJavaProcess.createClassLoader() should construct an instance of
NativeProcessClassLoader, but what class loader should /it/ belong to?
The class loader of the new process, or the class loader of the current
process? If it should belong to the new process (that is where it will
be referenced from the most), then we'll need some native code to set
that up. In other words, NativeJavaProcess.createClassLoader() should be
defined as a native method.

And the same goes for NativeProcessManager.constructProcess() which
should perhaps return a NativeJavaProcess that belongs to the new
process's class loader. Since this is impossible (chicken and egg), we
might provide a native call to assign the class loader to the process's
class later on in the sequence (and maybe reuse this technique for
assigning the class loader to the new class loader itself).

Notice that if we do this, we are demonstrating the first use of
inter-process object sharing. The calling process needs a reference to
the process it is creating, and the program running in the new process
will need to be able to reference itself too.

Now, the alternative is to define processes so that their class loaders
are not completely disjoint, but always share java.lang.Class,
ClassLoader and Object so that the instance of the process's class
loader can be shared between the calling process and the new process
without any special JVM support. But we still need a way to share the
JavaProcess instance. In the host implementation, I share the
JavaProcess Class too, but the host implementation doesn't particularly
care about doing this properly anyway.

To consider the issues involved here, it helps to look at the
ClassLoader.loadClass() method:

	public Class loadClass(String name)
		throws ClassNotFoundException;

This method is returning an instance of java.lang.Class - the same
java.lang.Class Class seems to be used by both class loaders meaning
that in a standard JVM, class loaders can't be completely disjoint as
well as being at all useful. With our JVM, which will support
interprocess object sharing, this will be possible.

&gt;<i> and the ability to correctly
</I>&gt;<i> handle native calls wrapper classes don't have to be written for every
</I>&gt;<i> static native method.
</I>
Native wrappers are only needed for the host implementation. The native
implementation should allow native method invocations for any class
loaded by any ProcessClassLoader. But this is more a responsibility of
decaf than of rheise.os, so it's not really something rheise.os needs
support before it can be considered renameable to jos.*.

Of course, the native implementation of rheise.os isn't complete, but
the structure is in place to support decaf/JJOS on one side, and the
Java layer on the other side. It's a matter of deciding whether or not
we want to use this as the structure to build around.

&gt;<i>         Otherwise, I'm very impressed.
</I>
Likewise with decaf, which is like Jupiter to my Pluto :-)
