Well, they've already been defined. You must initiate the loading of the
class again in L2, but defer its definition to L1 using
findSystemClass(), which will just return its cached version if it is
already defined.

&gt;<i> otherwise, this is the first

</I>
Not completely useless. Echidna manages to do something with the loaded
class without ever having to cast it to a known type by using
reflection. However, in the case of achieving RMI/CORBA-type usefulness,
you want to be able to cast the object (potentially illegally :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; You cannot cast the return value of newInstance() from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Applet(L2) to Applet(L1). You must ensure that Applet in each case is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the *same* class.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         Until that Applet(L2) is passed to a method (or assigned to a
</I>&gt;<i> field) that knows about Applet(L1), we're good.  It is not required, to my
</I>&gt;<i> understanding, that a classloader be /useful/.
</I>
Actually, newInstance() on the Applet(L2) class will still fail unless
Object(L2) == Object(L1), since newInstance() returns an Object. But if
you are only loading a class to invoke a static method on it (eg.
main()), you don't need to call newInstance() - as in Echinda. However,
to pass the arguments in to main() and catch its exceptions, you will
need to have Object in common (as well as other classes). Looks like
illegal casts are necessary to support completely independent
namespaces.

&gt;<i>         A native extension that would both allow efficient 'illegal' casts
</I>&gt;<i> and efficient memory usage would be, then, an assignClassLoader( Class c,
</I>&gt;<i> ClassLoader cl) method.  The JOS default custom classloader could use
</I>&gt;<i> findSystemClass to locate the (shared) class definition, and the
</I>&gt;<i> assignClassLoader() method to 'clone' it, marking it as a separate class
</I>&gt;<i> (and generating its independent statics) but flagging it as identical to
</I>&gt;<i> the system class for the 'illegal' casts.
</I>
Now, if the client process directly accesses static members, it will
access the cloned versions that belong to its own process. However, if
you call a method on an object that really belongs to another process,
and that method accesses a static member, then it should access the
static members of the class in the _other_process. Are there any
problems in implementing that?

There is a subtle problem with the findSystemClass/assignClassLoader
approach, though.

Let's first define what findSystemClass() does in the context of JOS. I
personally prefer findSystemClass() to refer to the primordial class
loader of the current process. But let's look at your model:

Using findSystemClass() to locate the shared class definition implies
that it is referring to a class loader that is an ancestor of the two
processes wishing to share, something like the root class loader. As you
said before, once a class loader loads a class, it is loaded forever.
That is, once the root class loader has loaded the shared class, it is
impossible to install and run a new version of your IPC-enabled program
because it will continually link to an old and potentially unusable
version of the shared class.

A modification of your idea can still work though. findSystemClass() is
one way to defer the definition of a class to another class loader. I
could imagine a server process that corresponds to an ORB (Object
Request Broker), and a findSharedClass(domain, class) method that defers
loading to the ORB's class loader for the specified domain*. Once
loaded, the class still cannot be redefined in that class loader, but
you can then call orb.reload(domain) which will cause the ORB to replace
its class loader for your particular domain.

A note on efficient memory usage, assignClassLoader() doesn't seem to be
a general solution to memory efficiency. It does save memory for classes
which are being shared between two processes, but does nothing for the
rest of the classes loaded in a process. To save memory on these
classes, you could try the approach I outlined in an earlier email
(share class definitions that are loaded from the same version of the
same archive, but keep separate areas for static fields).

In summary, it seems the assignClassLoader() approach will work, if it
is used in the right way.

{*} domains would correspond to the individual uses of IpC. For example,
you could define a domain for doing IPC between the window manager and
processes that wish to draw to a window.

&gt;<i> &gt; Also, when you consider that it is a security risk to allow user defined
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; classes to invoke native system methods (eg. you could bypass the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sandbox), various system classes (eg. System) must always be loaded by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the(/a) primordial class loader in order to make use of their native
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; methods. Of course, in JOS we might have an effective primordial class
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; loader for each process, so it's ok to reload the System class in each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; primordial (JOS-controlled) classloader.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         Right.  Classes which, for whatever reason, the Java code is
</I>&gt;<i> prevented from reloading must be reloaded by the native code; and it /is/
</I>&gt;<i> a good idea to restrict access to certain (specified) members of the (JOS)
</I>&gt;<i> class library.  (This would probably be better cast as a security issues
</I>&gt;<i> -- e.g. only code with an effective uid of root can call (native) method
</I>&gt;<i> N, but security is a while off...)
</I>
I wrote a document on security within JOS about a year ago, but I didn't
receive much feedback. It presents some ideas which are relevant here
(eg. setting the effective user id):

&gt;<i> &gt; I suspect this won't work (see above) - at least not in a normal JVM.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         The empirical test I described in the last email generated a log
</I>&gt;<i> of loaded class that included java.lang.System; whether or not I can
</I>&gt;<i> redefine it for long enough to be useful is another question entirely...
</I>
Not in a normal JVM. In JOS, we will want to redefine all classes, and
then be able to make use of them through native support.
