<PRE>This will be the last combined rheise.os/SwingToolkit release. In future
these will be released separately.

	<A HREF="http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/projects/rheise.os/">http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/projects/rheise.os/</A>

Specific changes in this release are as follows (scroll to the end of
this email for additional notes):

Changes to rheise.os:

        - Implemented System.exit() - sort of.
        - Implemented HostProcessClassLoader.getResourceAsStream()
        - Assigned delegators to kernel-space System statics.
        - Provided method to construct UserThreadGroup before User is
          known.
        - SystemObjects are created through
          ProcessManager.createSystemObjects()
        - Created &quot;basic&quot; implementation of process package.

Changes to SwingToolkit:

        - Frame.pack() works properly.
        - Added new peers:
                - CheckboxMenuItemPeer
                - ChoicePeer
                - MenuBarPeer
                - MenuItemPeer
                - MenuPeer
                - TextAreaPeer
        - Reorganised packages, created new package for swing widgets.


- Additional notes:

I looked at SwingToolkit for the first time in a year and noticed that
much of it didn't work. For example, if your application doesn't call
Frame.setSize() explicitly, you don't see the Frame at all (oops!). With
that fixed, it should be /much/ closer to being useful but without
actually being useful - it's work in progress.

One thing I noticed is that, with or without the SwingToolkit, both AWT
and Swing menus don't work under rheise.os (at least on Linux). It is
probably to do with assumptions on class loading which I'm breaking. I
created a new implementation of the process package called &quot;basic&quot; which
runs all processes in the same namespace. Menus work under this
implementation. To test this environment, run:

	java rheise.os.process.basic.BasicInit

Also in this release, I think I have the other 0.01% of System statics
working, ie. if a kernel space class accesses a System static, the
request will still be forwarded to the current process through
delegators.

- How you can help:

Since some people have shown an interest in helping, here are the main
areas that need attention:

	- Get other platforms working (eg. JDK 1.2 and Windows)
	- Expand on security APIs.
	- Fix remaining bugs in SwingToolkit.

There is too much for one person to do, so any help would be greatly
appreciated. If you're interested, check out the release notes for more
information on what's missing, and email me to see how you can help.

Thanks.
