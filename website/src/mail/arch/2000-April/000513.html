(before I answer, my proposal for access to statics of shared objects
doesn't change the semantics of object ownership, but I understand that
you're not responding directly to my comment)

Although I would personally choose to adopt the semantics of object
ownership you just described, I wouldn't rule out &quot;changing&quot; them. It is
similar to the concept of a UNIX hard link. You could say a file is
owned by a directory, but as soon as you make a hard link in UNIX, the
ownership is truly shared between all parent directories (UNIX hackers
will spot that I'm oversimplifying a little here).

But for the moment, suppose we state that an object is only 'owned' by
one process, it still may be useful to change the ownership of an object
to another process (eg. when the original owner dies, but other peers in
the distributed system want to keep on working with eachother). All I'm
saying is, I'm not ready to rule out ideas like this, although I don't
see the need to implement controversial ideas such as this right now. We
are in the early stages of development so we don't know what we will
need when we start to put JOS to use.

&gt;<i> An object cannot be owned by more than one process. An object cannot
</I>&gt;<i> literally be shared, even in a MPCL-compatible virtual machine. It can only
</I>&gt;<i> be shared by proxy.
</I>
Sharing by proxy is another idea again. But we can share an object
between multiple processes and still have a single owner.

Sharing by proxy means that rather than sharing a direct reference to
the object you want to share, a proxy/wrapper object is shared which
provides a level of protection for the owning process. However, to
implement this, we still need direct object sharing under the hood. I
think both types of sharing will be useful.
