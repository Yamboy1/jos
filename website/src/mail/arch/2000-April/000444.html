<PRE>&gt;<i> We agree so far, except I'm not sure what you mean by the &quot;quite
</I>&gt;<i> possibly by default&quot; bit. Do you mean it is quite possible to share all
</I>&gt;<i> class definitions by default, or that it is quite possible to consider
</I>&gt;<i> all objects for illegal casts by default?
</I>
	We /have/ to consider all objects for illegal casts by default for
this to work transparently.  Whether or not all class definitions are
shared by default is a design decision -- I was suggesting we should,
because it's the most efficient, and applications which want to do tricks
with classloaders won't be affected.

&gt;<i> A note: byte-for-byte checking is not the only alternative. If we
</I>&gt;<i> implement my proposal for memory saving, classes that were loaded from
</I>&gt;<i> the same version of the same archive will reuse the same class
</I>&gt;<i> definition even though they are different JavaClassInstances.
</I>
	See Gilbert's reply on why this won't work.

&gt;<i> While this seems more consistent to me, assignClassLoader() seems like
</I>&gt;<i> it will work too.
</I>
	We need assignClassLoader() for the reasons Gilbert outlined; the
JVM spec explicitly allows for classloaders that generate bytecode
on-the-fly.

&gt;<i> What we /could/ do is allow casts between any two classes that share
</I>&gt;<i> the same class definition (JavaClass). No restrictions. This is safe
</I>&gt;<i> because the power to cast is useless unless you have a reference to an
</I>&gt;<i> object that you want to cast. The restriction should be on gaining
</I>&gt;<i> access to the shared object.
</I>
	If we /don't/ allow this by default, then the application must
specifically request casting power in some fashion, which is something I
think we want to avoid.  That is -- for Serializable IPC, the two
processes MUST have different statics and MUST have the same class
definition in order to communicate.  Take the parent spawning a child
example; it seems evident to me that the expected behavior is that the
child and the parent will be compatible, without any special coding.  That
means (a) we by-default share class definitions and (b) by default allow
'illegal' casts.

&gt;<i> In my last email, I mentioned that an object that belongs to another
</I>&gt;<i> process should be able to access it's own static fields, but the client
</I>&gt;<i> code should not. It will instead access the static fields of its own
</I>&gt;<i> process. This makes the no restrictions approach safe from the statics
</I>&gt;<i> perspective as well.
</I>
	Exactly.  To be a separate process, the child must not have access
to anything in the namespace of the parent.  The exact implementation of
direct IPC we can leave for later.  (e.g. what happens you pass a class
reference to a different process?  Since normal java doesn't allow this,
we can also disallow it.  Etc.  This is near to mixing system policy and
design decisions.)

&gt;<i> Q2: What is the significance of sharing classes between a process and
</I>&gt;<i> its parent? I think you should be able to share classes with any other
</I>&gt;<i> process. And if all classes loaded from the same version of the same
</I>&gt;<i> archive share the same class definition, then this becomes possible (if
</I>&gt;<i> you allow casting between any two classes that share the same class
</I>&gt;<i> definition, as described above).
</I>
	You can; the signifigance of process/parent is that I understood
that to be the most common way for multi-process applications to be
written, and is a case where a default of sharing makes semantic
sense.  What we must avoid is separate processes NOT getting the chance to
load classes and use them from their own classloaders, e.g. their own
classpaths -- this is necessary for development, so I can, for instance, 
work on a daemon's source and test it while the production version is
running, or work on an editor in that editor, etc.  See below.

&gt;<i> Q3: Can you please explain the bit about an application reloading its
</I>&gt;<i> classes?
</I>
	Sure.  Class devEnviroment, immediately on its main() function
being called, creates a new classloader, CL.  Reading from the command
line, it decides to run main() of class developingClass.  It gets
developingClass from CL, and spawns a thread to execute
it in its own classloader.  When the thread terminates -- or the user
interrupts -- devEnviroment garbage-collects CL so that the next run of
developingClass is re-loaded from scratch, in case it's changed. 

&gt;<i> - I don't see the logic in only inheriting class definitions from the
</I>&gt;<i>   parent process.
</I>
	To be explicit: I did not propose that this would be the
/exclusive/ method for sharing, only propose that it be the /a/ (perhaps
/the/) default method of class sharing.  Independently-started processes
/must/ be given the chance to use their own independent
classes/classloaders; should they choose to use system-provided classes,
they should share definitions and be allowed 'illegal' casts.  (And
perhaps should be anyway.)
