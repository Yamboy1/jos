<PRE>Eventually, something must be added to reduce redundent bytecode. It is the
right thing to do. That was my conclusion over a year ago. But, it is not a
class loader.

Whatever it is, we should first add it to a virtual machine (decaf), refine
it through experience and testing, and then -- if necessary -- add it to a
kernel (jJOS). Any virtual machine would benefit from it. When we add it to
a kernel, it can work intimately with the kerne's virtual memory manager.

Without a virtual machine, there is no class loader. A &quot;kernel class
loader&quot; is not a genuine class loader. It cannot return an instance of
java.lang.Class. A class loader, implemented in machine code, can be added
to decaf, not jJOS. A kernel is not a virtual machine. It has zero or more
virtual machines.

Let's say there are 100 separate processes running in decaf at once. In the
worst case, 100 separate copies of the java.* packages would be loaded into
virtual memory (assuming jJOS has virtual memory). If the java.* packages
are 20+MB, thats 100 * 20+MB or 2000+MB. jJOS would require at least a 2GB
swap partition exclusively for system bytecode.

We already know that 100 separate processes won't load every class in the
java.* packages. In the typical case, a process might use 2+MB, not 20+MB.
That's 100 * 2+MB or 200+MB. jJOS would require at least a 200MB swap
partition exclusively for system bytecode.

Together, 100 processes would typically load every class file in the java.*
packages. With a bytecode or class definition cache, jJOS would &quot;only&quot;
require a 20+MB swap partition exclusively for system bytecode. Bytecode
would be loaded for each process and intern'd. The intern'd bytecode might
stay in the cache for the lifetime of the kernel. The intern'd bytecode
might stay in the cache until it is no longer used by any process.

A kernel must have a bytecode cache or a class definition cache; it cannot
have a class loader. With a bytecode cache, a kernel would offer a
VM-independent interface, usable by any virtual machine. It is not specific
to decaf. A bytecode cache maps correctly to bytecode resource, where
bytecode is part of the executable image of a virtual machine. A bytecode
cache works simultaneously for any virtual machine from Java 0 through Java 2.

With a class definition cache, a kernel would offer a VM-dependent
interface. A class definition cache must be recompiled when a virtual
machine changes. That means the kernel depends on the implementation
details of a virtual machine. This undermines a kernel's ability to host
different versions of a virtual machine.

ClassDefinition and Bytecode are not the same thing. Both are needed.
Bytecode is a VM-independent design; ClassDefinition is not.

A class definition class must return an instance of ClassDefinition when
given a ClassDefinition object:

const ClassDefinition intern( const ClassDefinition *v );

It must find an existing class definition quickly and compare it with the
given class definition. If they are equal, the existing class definition is
returned. Otherwise, a new class definition is added and it's returned.

A bytecode cache is at fast or faster than a corresponding class definition
cache. A bytecode cache must return an instance of Bytecode when given a
Bytecode object.

const Bytecode intern( const Bytecode *v );

The Bytecode class knows how to decode a class file. Its getThisClassSpec()
method returns a class spec. For java.lang.Object, the class spec is
java/lang/Object. The class spec is key to a large hash table. The large
hash table contains one hash table for each class spec. In the following
example, the C++ source has been translated to the equivalent for the Java
programming language.

  public Bytecode intern( Bytecode v ) {
    String cs = v.getThisClassSpec();
    Hashtable ch = findBytecode( v );
    if ( ch == null ) {
      return null;
    }
    Enumeration list = ch.keys();
    for (;;) {
      if ( !list.hasMoreElements() ) {
        return null;
      }

      Bytecode item = (Bytecode) list.nextElement();
      if ( item.getPayload().equals( v.getPayload() ) ) {
        return item;
      }
    }
  }
  public Hashtable findBytecode( String v ) {
    cache.get( &quot;java/lang/Object&quot; );
  }
