We agree so far, except I'm not sure what you mean by the &quot;quite
possibly by default&quot; bit. Do you mean it is quite possible to share all
class definitions by default, or that it is quite possible to consider
all objects for illegal casts by default?

A note: byte-for-byte checking is not the only alternative. If we
implement my proposal for memory saving, classes that were loaded from
the same version of the same archive will reuse the same class
definition even though they are different JavaClassInstances. Any two
classes that share the same class definition (JavaClass) are able to be
explicitly shared. Then permission can be asked of the JVM to allow
casts between certain pairs of JavaClassInstances.

While this seems more consistent to me, assignClassLoader() seems like
it will work too.

Agreed.

&gt;<i> and the default for sharing classes between a

</I>&gt;<i> objects -- e.g. via Serializable objects and a standard networking layer
</I>&gt;<i> -- the classes for the objects will cast to each other.
</I>
I'm not sure I understand this paragraph. I think we've gotten to the
point where one word can mean so many things :-)

Q1:

When you refer to sharing classes between a process and its parent, do
you mean just sharing class definitions to save memory, or explicit
sharing to allow casts? I don't think we should be generous in allowing
casts between processes.. oh, hang on...

U-Turn

What we /could/ do is allow casts between any two classes that share
the same class definition (JavaClass). No restrictions. This is safe
because the power to cast is useless unless you have a reference to an
object that you want to cast. The restriction should be on gaining
access to the shared object.

In my last email, I mentioned that an object that belongs to another
process should be able to access it's own static fields, but the client
code should not. It will instead access the static fields of its own
process. This makes the no restrictions approach safe from the statics
perspective as well.

Q2: What is the significance of sharing classes between a process and
its parent? I think you should be able to share classes with any other
process. And if all classes loaded from the same version of the same
archive share the same class definition, then this becomes possible (if
you allow casting between any two classes that share the same class
definition, as described above).

Q3: Can you please explain the bit about an application reloading its
classes?

In summary, we still disagree on a few points:

- I don't see the logic in only inheriting class definitions from the
  parent process.
- I prefer a more consistent (IMHO) approach to reusing class
  definitions.

But we at least agree on the general idea. Sorry for dragging this on -
just when you thought we agreed! 

Whatever we do, sharing class definitions seems crucial. Just as well we
have the split between JavaClass and JavaClassInstance!
