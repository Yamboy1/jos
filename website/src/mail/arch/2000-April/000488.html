I disagree. There must be two mechanisms. The getCurrentProcess() method
returns the current process -- regardless of who owns the code. The
getProcess() method returns the process that owns an object. While
getCurrentProcess() probably uses getCurrentThread(), getProcess() probably
uses getClass().getClassLoader().

Consider the AWT system carefully. The AWT is part of system classes
(java.awt.*). It is process-wide subsystem, not system-wide. It must be
part of each bytecode process. Each bytecode process has its own
java.awt.Toolkit. This is required to maintain the illusion that a bytecode
process is running within its own virtual machine. Two different processes
can have two different toolkits. Like a security manager, a toolkit is
unique to a bytecode process.

Each process must have its own AWT thread. Again, this is required to
maintain the illusion that a bytecode process is running within its own
virtual machine. A thread that pushes an event through a process must
belong to that process. The getCurrentProcess() must always return the
current process, regardless of object sharing.

On the other hand, JADE is a system-wide subsystem. There may be one
instance of JADE for each virtual console. The interaction between JADE and
AWT is this: JADE actually paints the screen for one or more instances of
AWT. JADE collects UI events and dispatches them to the appropriate
process. JADE components interact with corresponding AWT components. If 100
processes share a virtual console, there is one instance of JADE and 100
instances of AWT.

If there is more than one instance of JADE, only one instance of JADE can
be visible at a time in full screen mode. There may be special key
combinations or mouse events to switch between virtual consoles.
