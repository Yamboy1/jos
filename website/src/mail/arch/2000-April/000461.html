Yes, you are right to point out the bootstrapping problem. However, I
would solve it in a different way.

Rather than claiming that the primordial class loader must be available
before the filesystem is installed, I would claim that the
&quot;KernelClassLoder&quot; must be available before the file subsystem is
installed. In this case, the specification of the primordial class
loaders in my proposal remains valid.

The KernelClassLoader operates above all processes and is the first
class loader in the system to be created. That implies that the kernel
itself is not a process. Rather than using the CLASSPATH technique of
the primordial class loaders to load classes, it will read the required
classes from some known position (or positions) on the disk. When the
boot loader is installed, the physical location of the classes.zip (and
perhaps a separate kernel.zip) is recorded so it knows where to load
them from. (Also, the position of the native kernel code also needs to
be stored with the boot loader, and the position of required native
libraries (if they are separate libraries) need to be stored too.)

It occurs to me that any class loaded by a primordial class loader
should always share its class definition with the corresponding class in
the KernelClassLoader, if it exists there. This overrides the other form
of class definition sharing effectively whenever a &quot;kernel required&quot;
class is loaded. I believe this is a constraint for a correctly
functioning system:

&quot;kernel required classes&quot; can be defined as the set of classes that must
remain the same from system boot to shut down. At least in the context
of the primordial class loaders and the kernel class loader. This
includes classes such as java.lang.Object and java.lang.System. The
thinking behind this is that critical classes such as these should
behave consistently thoughout all system class loaders so that they may
trust each other. Note that in a standard JVM, you are allowed to
redefine the system classes before you start a new process. But then it
follows that processes such as these may not trust each other in the
same way that I'm proposing here.

I wouldn't say this idea is fully fleshed out, so feel free to point out
any holes.

&gt;<i> The ERIC Project proves that CLASSPATH is not required. Its custom class
</I>&gt;<i> loader never uses CLASSPATH. It uses a &quot;package&quot; path. It loads classes
</I>&gt;<i> from the local file subsystem. It downloads bytecode from an HTTP service.
</I>&gt;<i> It downloads package files. It could download .jars. It could download
</I>&gt;<i> .class files.
</I>
True, CLASSPATH is only one way of loading classes. It is the standard
way because it can be supported on each of the current host platforms
for standard JVMs, and the Java spec seems to cater for the lowest
common denominator.

I can imagine there will be places where we will want to abandon
sticking to the lowest common denominator. This may be one of them. One
case where we definately want to abandon the lowest common denominator
is adding support for file permissions (through the use of ACLs). I
present some ideas on this at:

	<A HREF="http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/jos/jos-security.html">http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/jos/jos-security.html</A>

&gt;<i> Absolutely. I am strongly recommending a byte-by-byte comparision on each
</I>&gt;<i> class file. The machine code version of memncmp() is not expensive when
</I>&gt;<i> compared to the large quanitity of wasted resources cause by duplication of
</I>&gt;<i> bytecode.
</I>
How about when compared to my proposal for class definition reuse? I
agree that they are both two valid alternatives. It's just a matter of
working out the tradeoff.

&gt;<i> 1. This optimization would help all class loaders across the board. It
</I>&gt;<i> would help our own primordial class loader and all user-defined custom
</I>&gt;<i> class loaders.
</I>
Here's part of the tradeoff. If we do it your way, we do get to save a
little more space. It depends whether it is worth it for the slower
speed of byte-for-byte comparisons.

&gt;<i> An application could easily determine if it was running in
</I>&gt;<i> a multiple process virtual machine:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   public void example() {
</I>&gt;<i>     if ( System.getClass().getClassLoader() == null ) {
</I>&gt;<i>       println( &quot;Running in a conventional virtual machine.&quot; );
</I>&gt;<i>     }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     println( &quot;Running in an alternative virtual machine.&quot; );
</I>&gt;<i>   }
</I>
If this is the case, we may be in violation of the spec. An alternative
is to test whether we are running within JOS by testing for the
existence of a JOS specific class or simply by checking for a certain
system property.

&gt;<i>   public Process getCurrentProcess() {
</I>&gt;<i>     Object o = this;
</I>&gt;<i>     for (;;) {
</I>&gt;<i>       ClassLoader loader = o.getClassLoader();
</I>&gt;<i>       if ( loader instanceof PrimordialClassLoader ) {
</I>&gt;<i>         return ((PrimordialClassLoader) loader).getProcess();
</I>&gt;<i>       }
</I>&gt;<i>       o = loader;
</I>&gt;<i>     }
</I>&gt;<i>   }
</I>
Excellent. I never thought of it that way. This actually solves a
problem I have with the &quot;host&quot; implementation in my prototype. I am
currently using the same algorithm as Echidna which is to determine the
current process from the current ThreadGroup which doesn't work properly
with AWT threads. It's a &quot;host&quot; specific problem, though, and this
method would work quite well in the &quot;native&quot; implementation.

It's interesting, though: both algorithms might actually be useful in
different situations because they can actually return different results.
The class loader based algorithm returns the process that owns a
particular class. Usually classes you have a reference to belong to your
process, but not always. The thread based algorithm will return the
current process of the controlling thread. If a thread starts operating
on objects in another process, this algorithm will return the process
that the thread belongs to rather than the process the object belongs
to.
