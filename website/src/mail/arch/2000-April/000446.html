<PRE>	Every (user-space) process is started by some other process,
except for init, which is started by the kernel.  Efficiency and common
sense would seem to indicate that processes which do not want to share
class definitions are the exception, rather than the rule.  This, in turn,
would suggest that the default classloader ought not to define classes if
there's already a definition available.  The combination of these implies
that the classloaders should organize their caches (== shared definitions)  
in the same heirarchy as the processes, that is, as a tree rooted with
init's classloader.  That is, when a new process is requested, a new
classloader is generated which has a pointer to its parent and nothing in
its cache.  When it receives a loadClass() request, it ought to, then,
check its cache (no) and ask its parent to return a new class from the
parent's definition cache, and so on; something like
loadClassFromDefinition(), a final native method defined on
java.lang.ClassLoader that walks the tree looking for cached class
definitions (JavaClass) to generate a new class instance ==
java.lang.Class instance (JavaClassInstance) from.  If
loadClassFromDefition() finds and generates a class, it returns that clas,
which the classloader caches and returns.  If loadClassFromDefinition()
can't find a cached definitoin, it returns null, and the classloader asks
the system (findSystemClass()) to find it; findSystemClass() must then
update the classloader's definition cache if it's successful.  Likewise,
for custom classloaders, defineClass() must cache new definitions.  This
scheme means 'illegal' casts must be allowed in general, as Ryan proposed.

	Custom classloaders are, of course, welcome to ignore their
parents.  The question then becomes what to do if they load a class which
happens to be indentical to some other, cached (and therefore identified
as legal to 'illegally' cast) class.  Gilbert suggests we maintain a large
cache of all bytecode in order to determine if two class definitions are,
in fact, the same.  This is going to be brutally inefficient.  I'm
strongly tempted to say that if you don't get the class from the system or
your parent, it can't be 'illegally' cast to a class from the system or
your parent.  This fits with what a programmer working with a conventional
JVM would expect -- that a custom classloader is only interoperable with
other classloaders so far as they got their java.lang.Classes from the
same place.  It also makes our job tremendously easier :)  I am, of
course, open to arguments to the contrary.
