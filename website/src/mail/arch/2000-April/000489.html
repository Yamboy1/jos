</I>
Maybe that way's better. I keep changing my mind on this so I should
probably think about it more thoroughly.

&gt;<i> Consider the AWT system carefully. The AWT is part of system classes
</I>&gt;<i> (java.awt.*). It is process-wide subsystem, not system-wide.
</I>
Not necessarily. I would have thought that the standard toolkit peers
belong to an AWT process. Peers need to collaborate with eachother, even
if they are peers of components from different processes. Therefore, if
the peers don't belong to the same process, there needs to be additional
object sharing - which I'd rather avoid since it is not necessary.

So, I see the functionality of AWT being split across the process
boundary. Part of AWT will be in the application's process, and part
(the peers) will be in the AWT process.

&gt;<i> It must be
</I>&gt;<i> part of each bytecode process. Each bytecode process has its own
</I>&gt;<i> java.awt.Toolkit.
</I>
Yes, or even multiple. But I would expect the default Toolkit to
delegate to the AWT process which is able to manage the creation of all
peers (so they can collaborate with eachother). The AWT system in a
standard JVM achieves this collaboration through native calls.

&gt;<i> Each process must have its own AWT thread. Again, this is required to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain the illusion that a bytecode process is running within its own
</I>&gt;<i> virtual machine.
</I>
This is a good idea. Although, it's not necessary. You can achieve the
illusion other ways, but it may make more sense to pass events over to
the AWT thread of a process if that's where it's destined.

&gt;<i> On the other hand, JADE is a system-wide subsystem. There may be one
</I>&gt;<i> instance of JADE for each virtual console. The interaction between JADE and
</I>&gt;<i> AWT is this: JADE actually paints the screen for one or more instances of
</I>&gt;<i> AWT. JADE collects UI events and dispatches them to the appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> process. JADE components interact with corresponding AWT components. If 100
</I>&gt;<i> processes share a virtual console, there is one instance of JADE and 100
</I>&gt;<i> instances of AWT.
</I>
I forgot that I'm not on the gui list so I may have missed the JADE
discussion. But if I can give my fresh perspective, I thought JADE was a
desktop environment that ran on top of a windowing system (ie. Toolkit).
It sounds like you're making JADE take on responsibility that is meant
to be handled by a Toolkit.

&gt;<i> If there is more than one instance of JADE, only one instance of JADE can
</I>&gt;<i> be visible at a time in full screen mode. There may be special key
</I>&gt;<i> combinations or mouse events to switch between virtual consoles.
</I>
Here it also seems you're talking about a Toolkit. ie. there can be a
Toolkit per virtual console (although, a single process can also use
multiple Toolkits, as I said before).
