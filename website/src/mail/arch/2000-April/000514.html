Hardly. If you stopped thinking the way you do, this project would make
far less progress.

I think flags are still useful if we use Gilbert's byte cache and apply
it to user defined class loaders. This breaks our assumption that any
two classes that share the same class definition can be shared. A more
correct statement is that any two classes that share the same class
definition and are loaded by primordial class loaders may be shared. It
just so happens that in my proposal for class definition sharing, my
original assumption held.

Although, even in this case, maybe the check can be done efficiently
without a flag.. Anyway, we can sort it out in the case that we end up
using Gilbert's byte cache.

</I>
Right. It's not just the JVM support, but native code support. I think
the 1.2 JVM does need to maintain additional information associated with
the class loader, stuff that's related to security. I'm not certain this
is the case, but from looking at the security APIs, it seems like there
needs to be JVM support.


&gt;<i> Actually, I'm pretty sure the JVM changes
</I>&gt;<i> will fairly minor, because otherwise the 1.2 jdk couldn't run 1.1 code :)
</I>
Although being backwards compatible doesn't mean that there aren't a
whole set of new features in JDK 1.2 that don't work under JDK 1.1.

&gt;<i> &gt; I must have missed it. We are talking about access to statics of shared
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; objects, right?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         Right.  MultipleJavaProcesses is the wiki topic for the text

</I>&gt;<i> possibility for collaboration.
</I>
Ok. I think it's probably best for you to work out how to phrase this
bit since you're most familiar with how the JVM works - if that's ok. Of
course, that means there's nothing left for me to write :-) Well, at
least for the moment.
