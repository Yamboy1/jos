<PRE>I have worked out a way to load a separate version of java.lang.System
for each process in a host JVM environment. I am still amazed that it
actually works, and yet it is so simple (of course, things are always
simple in hindsight).

The problem with loading a separate version of java.lang.System for each
process is that it can no longer access its native methods. Also, it is
difficult to move a single system class from the host primordial class
loader to the process class loader without causing linking errors.

To solve the first problem, I load my own version of java.lang.System
into each process which delegates native method calls to the &quot;real&quot;
java.lang.System class. You might wonder how one System class can
communicate with another System class with exactly the same name. You
/can/ use reflection, but I found a simpler way: I defined an additional
class called java.lang.SystemWrapper which is loaded by the same class
loader as the &quot;real&quot; System class (ie. the host primordial class
loader). My System class delegates to SystemWrapper, which delegates to
the System class that it resolves to. No reflection is needed.

_quinn will be pleased to note that this passes the &quot;ultimate test&quot;
which is to pipe the output of one program into another. In fact I have
a demo program which does just that:

$ rheise.test.Echo hello world
hello world
$ pipe rheise.test.Echo hello world | rheise.test.Reverse
world hello

I have released version 0.1.1 of rheise.os which contains these changes:

	<A HREF="http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/projects/rheise.os/">http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/projects/rheise.os/</A>

Note that since I have included my own version of java.lang.System, you
should make sure rheise.os appears in your CLASSPATH _after_ your JDK
classes.zip. My System class is not meant to replace the JDK one, it is
dynamically loaded in at runtime and cooperates with the standard one.

Also, I have assumed that your system classes are in classes.zip. If
they are not, you need to edit a source file, as described in the docs.
