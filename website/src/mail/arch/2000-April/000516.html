</I>
A link in a file subsystem is a useful analogy to the object graph in a
MPCL-compatible virtual machine. In a non-linked file, there must be two
parts: the actual payload (which exists once regardless of how many links)
and a directory entry. The payload exists for a while after the directory
entry is garbage collected. In a linked file, there are more than two
parts: the actual payload and one directory entry for each link.

In a virtual machine, it is hard to think about the object in the same way.
On the one hand, a system-wide object (without its class loader property)
is just like a payload. A process-specific object (with its class loader
property) is normally what we think of as an instance of java.lang.Object.

With a certain level of redirection, a system-wide object might be &quot;owned&quot;
by one or more processes if a list inside the object holds a reference to
each process. At the machine code level, all objects are owned by a virtual
machine.

In other words, the Process property is a list, not an item.

  public Process[] getProcessList() {
  :
  }
  public void addProcess( Process v ) {
  :
  }
  public void removeProcess( Process v ) {
  :
  }

When an object is &quot;shared&quot; it has more than one process in its process
list. During garbage collection, an object is destroyed when there are no
more processes in its process list.

&gt;<i>But for the moment, suppose we state that an object is only 'owned' by
</I>&gt;<i>one process, it still may be useful to change the ownership of an object
</I>&gt;<i>to another process (eg. when the original owner dies, but other peers in
</I>&gt;<i>the distributed system want to keep on working with eachother). All I'm
</I>&gt;<i>saying is, I'm not ready to rule out ideas like this, although I don't
</I>&gt;<i>see the need to implement controversial ideas such as this right now. We
</I>&gt;<i>are in the early stages of development so we don't know what we will
</I>&gt;<i>need when we start to put JOS to use.
</I>
This is the best thing I've heard all week. We can provide a function to
&quot;move&quot; an object from one user process to another. In other words, an
object can be passed to another process simply by modifying its Process
property.

I can imagine that a DatagramPacket can be &quot;sent&quot; to another user process
by updating its Process property from a protocol stack to a user process.
Since the protocol stack no longer owns the object, it can be garbage
collected in the usual way.

The idea of moving an object around, from process to process, is a strong
point of Java technologies. The same function could move an object from one
machine to another.

There is only one catch. A complex object could not be moved from one
process to another without moving all of its dependent objects. While it
might be good for shallow moves, it could not be automatic for deep moves.

&gt;<i>Sharing by proxy is another idea again. But we can share an object
</I>&gt;<i>between multiple processes and still have a single owner.
</I>
A directory entry is a proxy for a file's payload. A directory and payload
are separate. An object proxy is like a directory entry. A proxy is owned
by exactly one process. Behind the scenes, a proxy has an object property.
The object property always points to an object owned by the system process.

&gt;<i>Sharing by proxy means that rather than sharing a direct reference to
</I>&gt;<i>the object you want to share, a proxy/wrapper object is shared which
</I>&gt;<i>provides a level of protection for the owning process. However, to
</I>&gt;<i>implement this, we still need direct object sharing under the hood. I
</I>&gt;<i>think both types of sharing will be useful.
</I>
I believe a proxy will be more efficient than direct references. When the
Process property of each object is an item, it is very easy for the process
to be de-referenced. It is straight forward.

The idea of maintaining a list (see above) of processes makes it simple to
maintain process information but makes it difficult to de-reference. The
complexity is this: a process object returned from getProcessList() belongs
to another process. The implications of this are incomprehensible.

When each object belongs to exactly one process, the implications are easy
to understand (easy to code) and limit the object sharing to a centralized API.
