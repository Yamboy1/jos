There are several ways one might want invoke a program:

1. In a new process with a fresh primordial class loader. This behaves
   the same way as a standard JVM in that it will load the latest version
   of every class with respect to the filesystem.
2. In a new process but with a clone of the parent process's primordial
   class loader.
3. In the current process with a fresh primordial class loader.
4. In the current process with the existing class loader.

The option you were talking about is option (4). However, since this
option doesn't respect statics, option (2) might be required for some
programs to function properly. The advantage of (4) is that it is very
light weight.

Option (3) at first glance seems to provide no benefit over (1) in that
it requires the same amount of additional resources. The difference is
that it releases the resources of the previous program running in the
process. You only need to use this option if the parent process is
waiting on your process. If you use option (1) to create a new process
and exit, the parent process will finish waiting prematurely. It depends
on your waiting needs.

Option (2) might be useful if you want to spawn a number of processes
running the same program, and you want to make sure that they are
running exactly the same version of the code. If option (1) is used and
libraries are replaced on the filesystem during the spawning process,
the different processes won't all be running off the same version of the
program. I expect option (1) would be the expected &quot;normal&quot; behaviour,
but option (2) might be useful in some cases.

Note: some of my comments above might only be applicable when relating
it to my proposal for multiple Java processes. Please forgive me if
that's the case (then again, it may not be).

BTW, that proposal is now at:

	<A HREF="http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/jos/java_processes.txt">http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/jos/java_processes.txt</A>

I have implemented a prototype of this process model which has an
architecture to support both a host implementation (running on top of a
standard JVM - this is complete), and a native implementation (running
inside decaf - this is incomplete). I have been using it to experiment
with my ideas on a user model and security, documented at:

	<A HREF="http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/jos/jos-security.html">http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/jos/jos-security.html</A>

It's just something I've been using to experiment. I'll post the source
if you're interested. I just need to add a bit more to the native
implementation and write at least /some/ documentation :-)
