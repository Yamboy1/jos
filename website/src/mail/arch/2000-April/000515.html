(Strictly speaking, you could have said &quot;Shared objects and streams are
the fundamental building blocks of RPC, RMI, and CORBA,&quot; because the other
five things are all types of IPC.  But anyway...)

	Any form of IPC can be implemented in terms of any other form of
IPC.  Shared objects are currently implemented as message-passing between
stubs, because they can't be shared directly in a conventional JVM.  It is
similarly easy to see how RMI -- the invocation of a method in another
process -- could implemented using shared objects.  The distinction and
equivalance between IPC methods is of fundamental importance to parallel
programming; the question of whether message-passing or shared-memory is
appropriate rests on two questions: first, which is easier to program
(which interface should you use?); and second, which is more efficient (is
this program running on an 8-way SMP Alpha?  8 Athlons on a 10baseT
network?), where the hardware topology is the primary determinant.  That
is, the 8-way SMP will have better shared-memory performance, usually,
than the network of workstations (NOW).  On the 8-way SMP, message-passing
is implemented as an operation on shared memory, because it's so fast (has
hardware support).  On the NOW, shared memory is implemented as
message-passing because the only h/w support for i/o between nodes is the
message-based network.

	We can provide interfaces to both shared-memory (shared
object/stream) and message-passing (RPC, RMI, CORBA) techniques.  The
implementation of these interfaces (some of which are required by Java,
some of which we can define) is h/w-specific.  My feeling is that the
complexity of supporting loosely-coupled (non-physically-shared-memory)
hardware should not be present in the kernel, and should be handled in a
user-space library.  That user-space library may very well be jos.os.*!  
The kernel shouldn't be able to tell.  As a matter of fact, of all the
IPC methods, only shared memory requires kernel support.  Message-passing
can always be arranged over the loopback network device.  (Well, the
loopback network device (traditionally) requires kernel support, but it's 
not exclusively used for IPC.)  Writing the RPC, CORBA, and RMI libs is,
from my rather narrow-minded JVM-author POV, somebody else's
problem.  Whether or not they're optimized for an architecture which can
share objects is not my concern...  [btw, I used kernel a whole lot up
here, and I technically should have been saying JVM support.  While kernel
support would be necessary if we had native processes, we don't, so...]


	Multiple native processes do not require 'natively' shared
objects, as me and Ryan and have been contending; you could, conceivably,
have the JavaProcess object in each Java process stub out to the canonical
single JavaProcess that the (JVM's) scheduler plays with.  Doing this in
(non-decaf) Java would require the use of RMI, which really should be
implemented user-space -- and making a user-space call to create a process
strikes me as a Bad Idea.  Implementing it natively, we actually have two
choices: first, make two JavaProcess objects, one for each Java process,
that have private native pointers to the same JVM (C++) object, and whose
methods (all native) all operate on that object.  The second choice is
more elegant, because it's a general solution to the problem of
implementing a shared-objects API based on having references to
processes.

(BTW -- this API must be different from the one that would allow shared
objects across multiple machines; again, we don't want process creation to
depend on a user-space call.  That user-space API (PJM, let's say, for
parallel java machine) would use the kernel (JVM) -level calls for shared
objects if the processes in question were both/all on the same machine.)

	The difficulty in the second choice -- what Ryan and I have been
discussing/advocating -- doesn't like so much in enourmous complexity, but
in doing it for the first time.  AFAIK, nobody's done work quite like this
before.  (Though I have not done a literature search to confirm
that.)  We must be very careful with what we're doing, and that takes time
and alot of attention to little nagging details that looks suprisingly
like complexity. :)  My objective in object-sharing is the principle of
least suprises, mostly -- we want shared objects to act the way they
'ought' to act, which, to me, implies the way objects shared between
threads do.  It may be that we can't guarantee (sp?) certain properties we
must be able to if we allow/support this very simple model.  (Also, most
of the recent traffic has involved my rather stupid thoughts on
flagging, which turns out to be totally useless.)

	What properties do we need to guarantee?  First, that object
sharing doesn't violate any requirements for in the VM or language specs,
aside from the (I think) solved problem of type-safety.  That is, will the
program operate as it should?  Second, we need to guarantee that object
sharing does not adversely impact security or stability.  This combination
of conditions may very well impose some very strict limits on the kinds of
objects that can be shared.

	In general, shared objects are desirous across processes for the
same reasons they are across threads.  I see two: first, data, and second,
methods.  For the first, shared-memory is a very convienient way to
program certain kinds of parallelism; the second is OOP principle of
packaging data with the methods necessary to utilise it.  As it turns out,
we can mostly ignore methods!  Their bytecode is shared in the class
definition share that enables object sharing.  Because the data associated
with methods reside with the object, synchronization will behave exactly
as expected across processes.  Sharing of data...

	Clearly, sharing primitive types is not a problem, since they get
handled by-value anyway.  (And since Strings are immutable, you could make
a good argument that could be 'shared' by copying and nobody could
tell.)  The question that remains to ponder is what happens when (a) we
copy an object reference from a shared object or (b) a shared object's
method returns an object reference.
