We even have proof of that, with SwingToolkit :-)

Although control must switch over to native code at some point, and the
deeper the better. At the deepest level there could be an implementation
of java.awt.Graphics that draws directly to the screen, and perhaps has
a few more methods than its superclass to be more efficient for certain
types of operations (eg. g.drawPixel()).

For an implementation of AWT without peers, take a look at Kaffe (I
don't know if it's changed since I last looked).

Right, I see the distinction you're trying to make now. The Toolkit is
built on top of the windowing system, whereas I was treating them both
collectively as &quot;the windowing system&quot;. This actually maps to how I've
done it in SwingToolkit (hey, I wrote it a year ago! :-), where the peer
objects are considered part of the Toolkit and the swing components they
operate are considered part of the windowing system (as you described),
which runs in a separate process.

It makes sense now why you think there should be an AWT thread per
process. So, basic events originate from the windowing system and are
reposted by the AWT system of the interested process on its own AWT
thread.

The question is, do you call the windowing system JADE? I think I was
slightly confused because I thought JADE was a desktop environment that
ran on top of the windowing system.
