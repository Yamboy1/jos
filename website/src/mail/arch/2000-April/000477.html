<PRE>	[BTW, the footnotes aren't numbered correctly because I though of
them out-of-order.]

	Processes can be defined as two or more threads with disjoint
memory spaces, where each group of threads (ThreadGroup or not) which
shares a memory space constituting a process.  Because Java lacks
pointers, disjoint namespaces are sufficient to ensure disjoint memory
spaces.  (So long as object references are not shared between the threads
we wish to distinguish as separate processes.)  Java namespaces are
managed by classloaders; therefore, disjoint classloaders generate
processes.

	While Java lacks pointers, and is therefore that much less
vulnerable to the class of potential problems usually cited as motiviation
for establishing (conventional, native) processes in (conventional,
native-code-oriented) operating systems, the single-process assumptions
made in the Java class libraries and virtual machine spec lend us ample
reason to desire multiple Java processes.  (Where my desire is to pass the
'ultimate test': piping the output of one legacy program into the input of
another.)  The desire for multiple Java processes in a single JVM stems
from two sources: first, the JJOS kernel's current lack of multiple native
processes (that is, we can't take the 'easy way out' and run multiple
instances of decaf); second, the potential space efficiency benefits.  A
more secondary concern is the handling of shared-object IPC.

	The insight of disjoint classloaders generating processes combined
with an examination of the JVM spec leads to the realization that we must
'clarify' it to allow more than a single primordial classloader******.  A
Java application can not (and must not) be able to distinguish between
running in its own (conventional) JVM and in its own primordial
classloader.  That is, the from the application's point of view, a JVM is
comprised of the statics in the classes returned by findSystemClass().  
This clarification, then, gives us multiple processes in a single JVM, but
quite inefficiently (sp?).  Efficiency is gained by sharing class
definitions***, which are the portions of class invariant under writes to
static variables.  (From the implementation standpoint, a class definition
is the everything in the native representation of class that isn't the
value of the statics.)  This sharing of class definitions -- that is,
/not/ reloading the whole class library for each process -- must be done
very carefully to ensure two things: type-safety* and transparency.  
(That is, legacy applications must behave identically in decaf with
multiple processes as in decaf with a single process.)

	A share may be attempted if and only if****

(1) The class definitions involved are identical.  This may be determined
	in an implementation-dependent manner. ******  Likewise,
	implementations would determine when to check for class definition
	shares based on their criteria for equality.

(2) The classloader which is defining the class is a (native)** primordial
	class loader, and the cached class definition under consideration
	for sharing was also loaded/defined by a (native)** primordial
	class loader.

	These conditions have two sources; the source for rule one is
rather obvious.  The source for rule two is the requirement that legacy
programs which utilize custom classloaders must operate properly; that is,
custom classloaders do not expect to share definitions unless they
explicitly arrange for it, and it appears to be impossible to assure the
correctness of any implicit sharing we may arrange.


	With processes and an object-oriented language, the natural
extension is object-oriented IPC.  Message-based OO-IPC is already handled
by the class libraries and conventional JVM spec.  (See my earlier mail
about Serializable and RMI.)  Shared-memory (shared-object) OO-IPC
requires special handling by the JVM.  Without a spec, we (JOS) may define
our own.  The key realization for shared-memory OO-IPC is that the
classloaders, being disjoint, do not share classes, and thus, the object
can not be cast from one process to another.  We solve this by allowing
'illegal' cast operations as follows:

(1) The security system must OK the object share.  This allows us to flag
	the object as shared for efficiency.
(2) The object's class definition must be shared between the two
	processes.  (Implying it was loaded by a (native)** primordial
	classloader.)


	Furthermore, we must assure that native methods are accessible
from any classloader which would 'normally' (e.g. in another JVM
process) have access.  Currently, as JJOS/decaf has one library and one
revision of it loadable at a time, we don't need to worry about
this; everyone's native calls resolve the same way.  Later, it seems that
a model more-or-less identical to the one above described for sharing
class definitions would be applicable to native methods; in fact, in may
be possible to fold the location (e.g. instance of loaded library for this
classloader) into the class definition, and have everything work out
auto-magically.  (I'll need to read up more on libraries for this.)

* Amusingly enough, Java isn't type-safe anyway.  I don't have the
(academic) citations handy, unfortunately.  Likewise, Java's memory model
-- which I'm mostly ignoring, in part because of this -- is horribly
broken.  Bill Pugh, who's written some papers about it, seems to hold the
opinion (based on my second-hand information) that Sun's VM implementation
has a memory model which makes sense but doesn't follow the spec...

** Gilbert has some very interesting ideas about Java primordial
classloaders that I must admit I'm avoiding because they'd confuse things
(or me, anyway!) immensely before I get the processes thing nailed down.

*** A later refinement (like the above footnote) may be gained by
utilising a bytecode cache; see other emails for my thoughts on that.  
Like the previous footnote, I'm ignoring a perfectly good idea because it
might confuse me.

**** The phrase &quot;if and only if&quot; means I'm suggesting that when these
conditions are met, you /must/ share the definition.

***** Ryan suggests classfile/archive location and modification
date.  Gilbert suggested integration with the bytecode cache, and a
straight call to memcmp(); I've commented on both of these
before.  However, it occured to me that location &amp; date could utilise URIs
instead of filenames, which would allow the primordial (java or
otherwise) classloaders to do more interesting things and still share
class definitions; one would expect the classloaders which implement
remote URIs to use a bytecode cache.

****** Ryan's rheise.os package demonstrating that a very large chunk of
the functionality can be duplicated with smoke &amp; mirrors rather than
native support. :)
