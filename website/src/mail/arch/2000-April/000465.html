Fair enough. I don't think I know enough about the internals of decaf to
have much say in its development process. My input will mostly be higher
level design issues.

Sorry, it's fair enough to use an existing boot loader if it already
works. The only reason I bothered to imagine how one might work was to
ensure that classes may be correctly shared between the
KernelClassLoader and the primordial class loaders. I guess it is
possible to still achieve this through a third party boot loader, just
less efficiently. But it's not as important an issue as I thought it
was.
