<PRE>&gt;<i> If we use a bridge method, that method can perform access control,
</I>&gt;<i> meaning decaf itself doesn't need to do access control. So, decaf can
</I>&gt;<i> allow illegal casts between any two objects that share the same class
</I>&gt;<i> definition, so long as you are &quot;able to gain access to&quot; the object.
</I>
	That is, it will always allow 'illegal' casts, because you can
only ever be in a position to make them if the access control allows you.  
I never meant to suggest that decaf itself would handle access control,
just that given access control, we could make our checks more
efficient, that is, not check for illegal casts.  I'll say it again --
object flagging/tagging is not necessary, it just seems like a good
implementation idea.

&gt;<i> You could provide the option to share objects via weak references (JDK
</I>&gt;<i> 1.2). In this case, references to the shared object will automatically
</I>&gt;<i> become null when the server process exits.
</I>
	Of course, this doesn't help for jdk1.1.x apps, but again, since
JOS is defining this interface, that may not be a problem.  Elegant,
though.  (A pity decaf doesn't do weak references quite yet.)

&gt;<i> &gt; 	I'll think about how to add this to the summary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok.
</I>
	It /is/ on the wiki (MultipleJavaProcesses), so if you've got any
good ideas, feel free to help out with the editing.
