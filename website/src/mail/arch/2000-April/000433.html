<PRE>&gt;<i> I think they do something with statics, but I don't remember for sure.
</I>
	Yes, Echidna creates wrapper classes for the System.in/out/err
statics and threads that both register with a namespace manager, so that
the wrapped in/out/err classes read/write to a stream specified by their
namespace.  I didn't find anything relating to rewriting statics in
general.  Reloading of classes is accomplished by associating a specific
classloader with each 'process' and garbage collecting it on process
termination, so that the JVM unloads that classloader's classes.

&gt;<i> Only if, for example, class A (L1) tries to pass a variable of type N
</I>&gt;<i> into a method of class B (L2) - anything where N is mentioned in the
</I>&gt;<i> field or method descriptor. If it is not, then it is quite possible for
</I>&gt;<i> two classloaders to define the same class differently.
</I>
	Re-reading the spec, it does in fact always indicate that classes
are defined by the union of their classloaders and name, and must in fact
be considered loaded or not only on the basis of both the ClassLoader used
and the name.  (When a class is explicitly loaded through a classloader,
every operation on that class must go through that classloader, from
section 5.3 in the spec.)  It is clear that the situation you described is
the situation in which an error must be thrown, and in fact this is
described as a loading constraint in the section on field resolution.  
(That is, the type of a field as defined by its name and its class's
classloader must be the same of the type name of the reference and the
referrer's classloader.)  Likewise for parameter types in a method
invocation.

	My apologies; in summary, classloaders do define independent
namespaces.

	Considering memory issues: Echidna takes the position that the
reason for Java processes is to eliminate the need to load every
(necessary) class in the library each time you start a new Java
program.  Since I so badly misread the spec regarding classloaders before,
I decided to determine how independent the classloader's namespaces were
experimentally -- as this bears on how much work the JVM has to do to
support processes, and how much /must/ be shared.  Writing a custom
classloader, it looks like /nothing/ is shared by default, and it's the
responsibility of the classloader to be efficient by using
findSystemClass() if it so desires.

	This agrees with my interpretation of the spec, that the JVM
checks its tables for a classname/classloader /pair/ before deciding if a
classloader gets a chance to load classname; if the classloader is new,
one would expect it not to have any entries at all in the table.

	This would suggest that Echidna doesn't actually need to wrap
java.lang.System.  In fact, it would suggest the following code in its
custom classloaders would be sufficient:

if ( className == &quot;java.lang.System&quot; ) {
	/* fetch java.lang.System from the filesystem... */

	Class c = defineClass( className, buffer, 0, buffer.length );

	/* shorthand */
	Method setIn = c.getMethod( setIn, { java.io.InputStream } );
	setIn.invoke( null, { theInputStreamAsRedirectedByTheShell } );

	/* repeat for setOut, setErr... */

	return c;
	}

	and would allow redirection of /any/ java application.

	Generically, one's custom classloader would never call
findSystemClass(), instead always defining those classes by itself, so
that they get new statics.  Efficiency improvements would require native
support, something like setClassLoader( Class c ), so that the class
loader could use system class definitions (e.g. JavaClass) and have an
independent Class object (e.g. JavaClassInstance), where setClassLoader
would set the class loader and redirect the static fields pointer*.

	If one unzipped the class library**, it should be relatively easy
to write a proof-of-concept shell/classloader combination that could
handle redirecting normal main()-method java applications.  (It would need
a pair of classes like OutputToInputStream and InputToOutputStream.)  
Create a new classloader for each process, get, from that classloader, a
Class of java.lang.System, set its in/out/err streams as appropriate; also
from that classloader, fetch your run-a-main-method Thread subclass,
instantiate it, and run it.  Because it lives in the same classloader as
the System class you've defined (and, of course, the classloader instance
caches its classes), it will use the System class you've defined.  If
people feel is worthwhile, I'll give it a shot.

&gt;<i> Ideally, you want to limit access to another process's objects to &quot;as
</I>&gt;<i> much as is required and no more&quot;. This could be a matter of programming
</I>&gt;<i> style. When message passing between processes, the arguments and return
</I>&gt;<i> values can be of simple Classes intended only to carry data.
</I>
	True.  The question then becomes whether or not we want to forbid
direct object sharing or not; and to do so, I think, would be extremely
unfortunate.  Direct object sharing is like CORBA, except more so, and KDE
and GNOME are putting CORBA to work for them in good and interesting
ways...

&gt;<i> (Note, I hope I'm not way out of context since I entered this thread
</I>&gt;<i> late :-)
</I>
	No, not at all.  You're quite right to correct me when I'm so
dangerously wrong.  Thank you.

* As it stands, the primordial classloader returns JavaClassInstances,
which have pointers to ClassFields in them.  There's no reason to expect
that the JCI generated by a custom classloader would have the same
ClassFields pointer, unless it's returning a java.lang.Class it got from
findSystemClass, which is the case I'm discussing.

** So that you don't have to mucking about in .zip/.jar files, just
subsitute '.' in names with '/'.
