<PRE>&gt;<i> The subtle difference -- the only one I've been able to find so far -- is
</I>&gt;<i> how bytecode retains the original payload of a class file and a class
</I>&gt;<i> definition does not. The slight difference is only an issue of how
</I>&gt;<i> efficiently they can be intern'd, not semantics.
</I>
	There are -- I believe -- other efficiency benefits to class
definitions, but I also can't come up with a reason why you couldn't wrap
bytecode in the same interface as you do a class definition and have
everything happen correctly.  It may be worthwhile at some point to write
such a class and see; it would become painfully clear, as well, where
efficiency gains could be made.  For instance, constant pool look up --
which happens all the time -- doesn't lend itself to O(1) (constant-time)
lookups, because the constants in the pool aren't the same size.  
Converting (or maintaining) to a list of pointers to constant pool entries
changes the algorithm from O(n) (linear-time search) to O(1), while
increasing the space bound by n.  Given that our target platform is a PC,
I think we can afford that.  Similar issues occur w.r.t. encoded values,
especially UTF-8 to (wide) character strings.

	There is analogy between a compressed zip archive of classfiles
and the exploded directory tree, and the classfile and the class
definition.
