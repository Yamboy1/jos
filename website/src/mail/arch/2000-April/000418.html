<PRE>The latest design for Smart API defines a process: scheme. This scheme
always returns an instance of java.lang.Process (or null). An instance of
java.lang.Process uses streams for stardard in, out and error.

Today, a new browser must be developed to display processes. The input and
output from a process should be browse-able in the UniversalBrowser.
Keystrokes entered into the process browser should be passed to the
process. Characters from the process should be displayed in the browser.
The ProcessBrowser might be constructed from an AWT canvas. When a URI
starts with &quot;process:&quot;, the ProcessBrowser is selected. It should create
the process. It should display the output from a process. For input,
keystrokes should be converted to ASCII characters and sent to the process.

The run: scheme is intended to run all kinds of programs, including threads
and processes. The run: scheme support scheme chaining. The process:
subscheme returns an instance of org.jos.program2a.Program. It is
compatible with the ProgramBrowser. The subscheme returns a program, not a
process.

The Find application can be created in the current thread. The program is
started when Program.run() is invoked.
  run:program:org.jos.gchii.find2a.Find

The Find application can be created in a separate thread. The thread is
created and started when Program.run() is invoked:
  run:thread:program:org.jos.gchii.find2a.Find

The Find application can be created in a separate process. The process is
created and started when Program.run() method is invoked:
  run:process:program:org.jos.gchii.find2a.FindProgram

This subscheme does not use embedded URIs. Therefore, the priority of a new
thread is normal and a child process inherits the environment of its parent
(CLASSPATH,etc).
