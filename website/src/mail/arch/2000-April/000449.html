Ok, so the &quot;quite possibly by default&quot; bit refers to what came before
it. Of course, standard English usage :-)

So, in the case where all class definitions are shared by default, it
follows from the remainder of your original sentence that all objects
&quot;are considered the same for 'illegal' casts&quot;. 

In this case (where you share all class definitions), our ideas are very
similar. The difference is that I don't believe it makes any sense to
just reuse the class definitions of the parent process. You need another
mechanism to ensure that classes in a child process can share their
class definitions with the parent process. In fact, since there's
nothing special about the parent-child relationship in this context, the
purpose of the mechanism is to ensure that classes in process A can
share their class definitions with process B, where process A and
process B are any two arbitrary processes.

Before you object, I would like to explain the feasibility of
implementing such a mechanism. Also, I hope to clear up some other
misunderstandings later on in this email, and include a complete(ish)
specification of my proposal. Please bare with me.

But first, consider this real-life scenario: a command-line session:

$ vi README
-- here, it turns out to be safe to reuse class definitions from the
parent process (in this case, the shell)

$ export CLASSPATH=/new/versions/of/some/libraries:etc:etc:
-- you see where I'm going

$ vi README
-- ok, it is no longer valid to reuse the same class definitions since
we are now loading classes from a different location. Only classes that
are being loaded from the same archive may be shared. The new CLASSPATH
may specify some archives to be the same as they were before. In this
case, only classes loaded from those archives may be shared with
processes invoked under the old CLASSPATH.

You see, in order to implement _correct_ sharing of class definitions,
you *need* a mechanism to determine that classes were loaded from the
same archive (more specifically, the same version of the same archive).

- What happens if you try to cut corners?

Ok, we definately want to share class definitions in order to save
memory. But what happens if we use an unintelligent algorithm for
deciding to share a class? Old classes may get linked into your
application causing NoSuchMethodErrors and such (or class verifier
exceptions).

Any solution for saving memory should not impact on the external
behaviour of the system. The fatal flaw in cutting corners here is that
it does change the external behaviour. Whenever you reuse a class from
the parent process, you are potentially linking in a class that the
_user_ did not intend to use. If the class has been updated on disk
since the parent shell was started and the user executes a new command,
the new version of the class should be used - the class definition
should not be reused from the parent process. Similarly, if the user
changes their CLASSPATH to pickup libraries from a new location, the
class definitions should not be incorrectly shared.

Here's another scenario. Suppose you are developing a text editor called
&quot;vi&quot;. &quot;vi&quot; is installed on your system in a standard system directory
and your default CLASSPATH is set to pick it up from there. Obviously,
if you run 10 instances of &quot;vi&quot;, from the same binary, they should all
share the same class definitions to save memory. But, if you decide to
do some more development work on a separate copy of vi, you might change
your CLASSPATH to pick up vi from your own classes directory:

- scenario:

1. The programmer opens up a number of source files, each in a different
instance of &quot;vi&quot;. The default CLASSPATH is used so the system version of
vi is used.

2. In a separate shell window, the programmer types:

$ export CLASSPATH=&quot;~/projects/vi/classes:$CLASSPATH&quot;
$ javac -d ~/projects/vi/classes *.java
$ vi Test.java
-- test the new version of vi - iterative recompilation and testing.

Here, and in the generic sense, determing whether or not to share a
class has nothing to do with the parent/child process relationship. They
are orthogonal. So, how do you know to share class definitions for all
the instances of &quot;vi&quot;, but not for the developer's version? Another
interesting example is a multi-user system in which one user decides
they want to run a later version of &quot;vi&quot;, so they download it and set
their CLASSPATH appropriately. How do you know when to share and when
not to share class definitions. I believe I have proposed the most
consistent solution that maps more closely to reality.

Now, I would like to clear up any misunderstandings and then hint at
some possible ways of implementing this if we decide to do it.

There was some concern that my proposal would affect external behaviour
regarding user defined class loaders. It won't. My proposal (I believe)
is in complete compliance with the JVM spec apart from the ability to
explicitly share object references between processes - which is our
mutual goal. The complete proposal that follows should clear up any
misunderstandings. It is easier to grasp if you can read it all as a
whole, rather than in little pieces here and there.

== Proposal for multiple processes in a single JVM ==

= Definition of Terms

- Class : a runtime class associated with a particular class loader
- Class definition : the runtime implementation of a class
...

= The basic model

Each process will have its own primordial class loader. As in a single
process JVM, the primordial class loader will have a copy of
java.lang.Object, and any other system and library classes that are
directly referenced by the main class of the program being executed.
Each primordial class loader will appear to work exactly like it would
in a single process JVM.

The running program may use a custom class loader to load classes from
any source (eg. on-the-fly, filesystem, or network). These custom class
loaders will behave exactly as they do in a normal JVM (after all, they
are user defined).

Each process has associated with it System properties which include the
CLASSPATH value for the process. A process's primordial class loader
will always load classes which represent class files found in its
CLASSPATH.

= Memory optimisations

Since the primordial class loaders are owned by the system, they can be
trusted to perform certain memory optimisations transparently.
Particularly, sharing class definitions that have already been loaded. A
requirement is that any memory optimisations performed do not change the
external behaviour of the primordial class loaders.

As has been stated, a process's primordial class loader will always load
classes which *represent* class files found in its CLASSPATH. The memory
optimisations proposed here are to determine if there is already a class
definition in memory that *represents* a class from the archive in the
process's CLASSPATH. To achieve this, the JVM needs to be able to label
the version of each loaded class, and efficiently determine the version
of classes on the filesystem. If they differ, the class definition
cannot be reused.

One way to implement this is to use the pathname and file modification
dates as the version information. I believe Solaris does a similar
optimisation - ie, if you run 100 instances of 'vi', it will share the
executable code in memory. And if you run your own version of vi, it
will allocate a new memory space for your executable code.

= Sharing objects between processes

It is desirable to share objects between processes to provide a more
efficient mechanism for RMI-type functionality. However, to support
this, we must go against the JVM spec. The goal here is to make
everything work exactly the same as a real JVM, but with the added
ability to share particular objects between processes. No objects will
be shared by default (in which case this is exactly the same as a real
JVM), but permission may be granted to share particular objects.

This proposal states that casts between any two classes that share the
same class definition are granted by the JVM. The power to perform
illegal casts such as this is useless unless you have actually been
granted permission to obtain a reference to an object of another
process.

It is important to understand that the only case in which two classes
share the same class definition is where one class belongs to one
process and the other class belongs to a different process. You cannot
have a class loaded by a user defined class loader sharing a class
definition with a class loaded by the primordial class loader because
only the(a) primordial class loader can perform the optimisation that
links both classes to the same class definition. Only the(a) primordial
class loader can be trusted to perform such memory optimisations. In
other words, only classes defined by a primordial class loader can reuse
the definition from another primordial class loader. 

This is important because it means that standard illegal casts between
class loaders in a single process will still be handled correctly.

====== end of proposal =======

Sorry for the length, but I feel that my proposal was not completely
understood. I don't want to say that &quot;this is the way it should be
done&quot;, but I think my proposal should at least be considered as an
alternative. And to be considered, it needs to be understood.

In the rest of this email, I will address each of the comments people
made:


&gt;<i> &gt; A note: byte-for-byte checking is not the only alternative. If we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implement my proposal for memory saving, classes that were loaded from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same version of the same archive will reuse the same class
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; definition even though they are different JavaClassInstances.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         See Gilbert's reply on why this won't work.
</I>
See my reply on why this WILL work :-)

Don't worry, I will get around to addressing Gilbert's email with a
little more detail.

&gt;<i> &gt; While this seems more consistent to me, assignClassLoader() seems like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it will work too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         We need assignClassLoader() for the reasons Gilbert outlined; the
</I>&gt;<i> JVM spec explicitly allows for classloaders that generate bytecode
</I>&gt;<i> on-the-fly.
</I>
I believe I have addressed this in my proposal. User defined class
loaders will work exactly the same as they do in a normal JVM. Object
sharing is only allowed for classes defined by primordial class loaders.

&gt;<i> &gt; What we /could/ do is allow casts between any two classes that share
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same class definition (JavaClass). No restrictions. This is safe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because the power to cast is useless unless you have a reference to an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; object that you want to cast. The restriction should be on gaining
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; access to the shared object.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         If we /don't/ allow this by default, then the application must
</I>&gt;<i> specifically request casting power in some fashion, which is something I
</I>&gt;<i> think we want to avoid.
</I>
True, so we do want to allow such casts to be unrestricted. However, I'm
all in favour of requiring permission to gain access to a shared object,
by some means (as opposed to gaining permission to actually perform a
cast). This is because if the mechanism is there to allow one process to
obtain a reference to a shared object, then any other process can also
obtain a reference even if they are not supposed to. Therefore we need
some means by which only authorised processes can access certain shared
objects. There are probably a few ways of doing this.

&gt;<i> &gt; In my last email, I mentioned that an object that belongs to another
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process should be able to access it's own static fields, but the client
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code should not. It will instead access the static fields of its own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process. This makes the no restrictions approach safe from the statics
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; perspective as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         Exactly.  To be a separate process, the child must not have access
</I>&gt;<i> to anything in the namespace of the parent.
</I>
Not that there's anything special about the parent ;-) A process must
not have access to anything in the namespace of any other process.

&gt;<i>  The exact implementation of
</I>&gt;<i> direct IPC we can leave for later.  (e.g. what happens you pass a class
</I>&gt;<i> reference to a different process?  Since normal java doesn't allow this,
</I>&gt;<i> we can also disallow it.  Etc.  This is near to mixing system policy and
</I>&gt;<i> design decisions.)
</I>
Do you mean passing instances of java.lang.Class? Yeah, that's
interesting. I get the feeling there's something special about the Class
object. If you use a custom class loader to load a class in a different
name space, it is still an instance of java.lang.Class in the _current_
namespace - or perhaps that's just because it needs something to
represent the class with in this namespace.

&gt;<i> &gt; Q2: What is the significance of sharing classes between a process and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; its parent? I think you should be able to share classes with any other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process. And if all classes loaded from the same version of the same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; archive share the same class definition, then this becomes possible (if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you allow casting between any two classes that share the same class
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; definition, as described above).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         You can; the signifigance of process/parent is that I understood
</I>&gt;<i> that to be the most common way for multi-process applications to be
</I>&gt;<i> written, and is a case where a default of sharing makes semantic sense.
</I>
I think that's historic. Many multi-process applications of that
structure were written in that way because of lack of threads. Even with
thread support on UNIX, many people still find it easier to spawn child
processes because they don't know how to use the threads API.

True multi-process systems where each component interacts with eachother
to achieve a result  tend not to be based on parent child relationships.
They are all equally important components that use a lookup service to
find the other process (RPC), or a lookup service to find an object in
another process (CORBA and RMI).

In the example of programs needing to do IPC to draw to windows owned by
the window manager, there is no parent-child relationship. The window
manager can be shut down and restarted, just the same as programs which
try to interact with it. It's a horizontal relationship.

&gt;<i> What we must avoid is separate processes NOT getting the chance to
</I>&gt;<i> load classes and use them from their own classloaders, e.g. their own
</I>&gt;<i> classpaths -- this is necessary for development, so I can, for instance,
</I>&gt;<i> work on a daemon's source and test it while the production version is
</I>&gt;<i> running, or work on an editor in that editor, etc.  See below.
</I>
I address the same requirement in my proposal, I chose to have this
handled by the primordial class loaders in a generic fashion.

One of the points you disagreed with me on was that determining whether
or not to reuse a class definition based on what version of the class
was being read (ie. what CLASSPATH is being used) would not work, as per
Gilbert's email. It seems to me that it does work and it is required
when you take the CLASSPATH into account.

&gt;<i> &gt; Q3: Can you please explain the bit about an application reloading its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; classes?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         Sure.  Class devEnviroment, immediately on its main() function
</I>&gt;<i> being called, creates a new classloader, CL.  Reading from the command
</I>&gt;<i> line, it decides to run main() of class developingClass.  It gets
</I>&gt;<i> developingClass from CL, and spawns a thread to execute
</I>&gt;<i> it in its own classloader.  When the thread terminates -- or the user
</I>&gt;<i> interrupts -- devEnviroment garbage-collects CL so that the next run of
</I>&gt;<i> developingClass is re-loaded from scratch, in case it's changed.
</I>
I see what you're talking about now. In my proposal, this is handled
generically by the primordial class loader which always works off its
CLASSPATH.

</I>
I intentionally opted to disallow class sharing between custom class
loaders since there can be no guarantee that te classes are compatible
for the purposes of IPC. Yes, a class defined by a custom class loader
will end up having a different non-compatible type, but that doesn't
stop you from defining the class using your primordial class loader, in
which case the system will allow you to participate in object sharing.

&gt;<i> 2. Two different archives can store the same class file. Even if a class
</I>&gt;<i> file comes from two different archives, an optimized virtual machine should
</I>&gt;<i> keep one instance.
</I>
I disagree. There is no guarantee that the same class file in each
archive is the same byte-for-byte (unless you do a byte-for-byte
comparason, which is unrealistic). If you share the class definitions in
this case, you can start running into incompatibility problems
(NoSuchMethodError), or Security problems (eg. you think you've loaded a
particular class, but the system has just gone and reused a different
class definition that does something different - something potentially
bad).

&gt;<i> &gt;Note that we will effectively have a primordial classloader for every
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;process, each under the control of the JVM. Since nearly every class
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;will be loaded by one of these classloaders, the JVM can check if they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;are coming from the same archive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The JVM cannot easily check if a class is coming from the same archive.
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the problem comes from an archive with two or more &quot;names&quot;. On my
</I>&gt;<i> computer, each of these names refer to copies of one archive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   ~/eric/org.jos.gchii.eric1c.jar
</I>&gt;<i>   /home/Gilbert/eric/org.jos.gchii.eric1c.jar
</I>&gt;<i>   C:\BORLAND\lib\org.jos.gchii.eric1c.jar
</I>&gt;<i>   M:\eric1b-4\org.jos.gchii.eric1c.jar
</I>&gt;<i>   M:\eric1b-4\limited\org.jos.gchii.eric1c.jar
</I>&gt;<i>   V:\eric1b\org.jos.gchii.eric1c.jar
</I>
It is easy to check if it is coming from the same archive. The class
loader loops through each archive in the classpath and stops when it
finds the class. The archive at which it stops is the archive that the
class came from. In addition to identifying the archive by path, you
also need to check the date (or some other versioning information) to
ensure that someone hasn't replaced that archive with a different one
potentially containing different versions of the classes.

(An idea, instead of using the path as part of the identifier, maybe you
could use a file id instead - an id that tracks the file wherever it
moves. Yes, it's unrealistic for now, but I imagine filesystems in the
future will export a kind of unique id for files. eg. filesystems with
built in version control. That's another thread :-)

&gt;<i> Remember, the puzzle is not to identify unique archives, but unique content
</I>&gt;<i> of class files.
</I>
Do you agree that isolating the archive that it came from at least
achieves the required level of correctness? I see little benefit in
comparing the actual content of each class file. Checking path and
modification date of a class file or jar file guarantees that the system
will never make the mistake of reusing the class definition for
incompatible versions of the same class. If you simply run &quot;touch
/usr/lib/vi.jar&quot; which changes the modification date of the archive but
doesn't actually change the contents, then my system will not share old
class definitions that are already loaded with any new vi processes that
are started. You might say that this is wasted opportunity for saving
memory, but I think it's a good tradeoff considering that modification
dates usually reflect changes to the content, and byte-for-byte checking
is very expensive.

&gt;<i> &gt;- always maintain separate statics for different classloaders
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is an option, not a requirement. The Java Virtual Machine specification
</I>&gt;<i> does not require separate statics for different class loaders. It
</I>&gt;<i> rightfully puts the decision in the hands of the custom class loader. A
</I>&gt;<i> virtual machine must support the option of separate statics for each
</I>&gt;<i> instance of a custom class loader.
</I>
It's not an option of the JVM. A class defined by one class loader must
have separate statics from the same class defined in a different class
loader. Perhaps you misunderstood what I was saying. I was referring to
leaving the static part of a class associated with the class loader (as
per the jvm spec), but detaching the definition part so that it can be
reused in other class loaders. This is the same concept that _quinn
actually invented a while ago. I'm just reusing it.

====

Once again, sorry for making this such a long email but I'm just trying
to give you a level of understanding that allows you to treat this as a
valid alternative. I don't want to make up your minds.

Thanks for your time :-)
