I see it the other way around. Shared objects and streams are
fundamental building blocks of RPC, IPC, RMI and CORBA.

Optimising the protocol stack requires shared objects as a fundamental
building block. 

&gt;<i> &quot;Flagging&quot; an object as shared is un-definable. Very quickly
</I>&gt;<i> flagging shared objects gets very complicated. Why re-invent the wheel? We
</I>&gt;<i> already have a well-refined inter-machine communication that solves the
</I>&gt;<i> inter-process communication problem.
</I>
While flagging has its problems, that doesn't rule out having object
sharing as a fundamental primitive. The existing inter-machine IPC
solution satisfies us for inter-machine IPC but not inter-process IPC on
the same machine. Raw object sharing is *much* faster. Even with an
optimised protocol stack as you described (even though this is a good
idea, as far as optimising the operation of existing RMI and CORBA
implementations goes), the very nature of this style of IPC means it has
to do much more additional work. Even if you optimise the transfer of a
packet from one process to another, the data in that packet needs to be
serialised and un-serialised. Using raw shared objects (either directly
or via a proxy) means that objects do not need to be serialised and read
back in to construct a new object.

&gt;<i> An object is by definition 'shared' when it is found in an RMI or CORBA
</I>&gt;<i> registry.
</I>
Not in the sense that of the term 'object sharing' that we have used so
far. RMI and CORBA provide a way to effectively share objects when you
don't have (or can't have) true object sharing.

&gt;<i> &gt;Another point occurred to me: efficiency may not be that important since
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;access to shared objects will be rare (compared with access to objects
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that are in the same process).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly! The greatest positive impact comes from a protocol stack that
</I>&gt;<i> takes advantage of a MPCL-compatible virtual machine. By making the
</I>&gt;<i> protocol stack more efficient, we make all applications more efficient,
</I>&gt;<i> even RMI and CORBA.
</I>
Yes we do, but we could make RMI and CORBA more efficient (for IPC on
the same machine) by writing our own versions that use true object
sharing.

&gt;<i> &gt;On the topic of JDK 1.1.x vs. JDK 1.2, rheise.os is currently based on

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;work with mine we will need to either move our base level support to JDK
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;1.2, or rewrite his registry to support JDK 1.1. I'm a bit nervous about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;moving to JDK 1.2 just yet, but I'm wondering whether you have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;different opinion. Is JDK 1.2 realistic for you?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The multiple primordial class loader (MPCL) design is not limited to one
</I>&gt;<i> Java platform. A kernel is not tied to one virtual machine, is it? On one
</I>&gt;<i> machine I could run decaf on top of jJOS. On another, I could run an
</I>&gt;<i> experimental version of decaf on top of jJOS, right? A kernel is not
</I>&gt;<i> reusable if it only runs one virtual machine.
</I>
The JJOS kernel is not the issue since it has nothing directly to do
with any particular version of Java. JJOS can support any version of
Java because it doesn't handle Java directly.

The layer on top of JJOS (decaf/classpath) is what supports the
different versions of Java, and currently JDK 1.2 seems like a long way
off. That doesn't mean we can't use JDK 1.2 for the host version of
rheise.os, but my question is whether we should start writing core
system components of JOS to depend on JDK 1.2 when other parts (eg.
decaf) can't support it yet.

One option is to take the parts of classpath that support JDK 1.2 and
use them as libraries linked in to JOS running against JDK 1.1. For
example, classpath has an implementation of the collection APIs that we
can reuse under JDK 1.1 if we want to use them.

&gt;<i> &gt;I must have missed it. We are talking about access to statics of shared
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;objects, right?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We should not tamper with the simplicity of the Java Virtual Machine
</I>&gt;<i> Specification. We should not change the semantics of object ownership

I'm out of time here, so I'll answer this later (in a couple of hours).
Sorry.
