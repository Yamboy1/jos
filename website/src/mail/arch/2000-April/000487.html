</I>
The idea was that setIn() is for user programs (it checks the security
manager), and a special init() method would only be executed by JOS and
it would just set the attribute values directly.

I see your point that calling setIn() saves us from modifying classpath.
Maybe there is a third option, though:

It seems to make sense for the static initializer to handle it all, as
it does in classpath. It calls on FileDescriptor.in to initialise
System.in and it could do a similar thing for system properties (and the
security manager in some cases). We just need to set up those data
sources before System is initialised. This should be quite easy in the
nativ implementation (through native methods), although a bit tricky for
host (which I think I'll leave as it is). I wouldn't mind at all if
someone else did the native version :-)

&gt;<i>         Most of the support, I believe, will be telling it not to call
</I>&gt;<i> library functions we don't provide in its native code. :)  (Seriously, if
</I>&gt;<i> you download the classpath distro, take a look at the vm/ subdirectory,

</I>
I expect there will (need to) be some VM-specific stuff for initialising
FileDescriptor.in.

&gt;<i> &gt; Notice that if we do this, we are demonstrating the first use of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inter-process object sharing. The calling process needs a reference to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the process it is creating, and the program running in the new process
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will need to be able to reference itself too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         In general, we want the calling process to have a reference to the
</I>&gt;<i> spawned process, and spawned process obviously needs to reference itself.
</I>&gt;<i> The question we must address is where the class definition of that
</I>&gt;<i> reference should reside.
</I>
I am thinking that the class definition resides in a cache separate from
all processes. Only actual java.lang.Class-es reside in a place
associated with a particular process. (see below for a further analysis
of class definition caches)

&gt;<i>  Since this OO-IPC referencing will need
</I>&gt;<i> 'illegal' casts, the obvious answer is that the JavaProcess class needs to
</I>&gt;<i> be shared between the primordial loaders of each process.
</I>
Do you mean the JavaProcess class _definition_ needs to be shared?
(because an alternative way is to actually share the Class). I also came
to this conclusion in this post:

	<A HREF="http://jos.org/pipermail/arch/2000-April/000461.html">http://jos.org/pipermail/arch/2000-April/000461.html</A>

&quot;It occurs to me that any class loaded by a primordial class loader
should always share its class definition with the corresponding class in
the KernelClassLoader, if it exists there. This overrides the other form
of class definition sharing effectively whenever a &quot;kernel required&quot;
class is loaded. I believe this is a constraint for a correctly
functioning system&quot;

Of course, the KernelClassLoader is just a concept. It is not
necessarily a tangible thing.

We can identify two class definition caches:

- one that is shared between all primordial class loaders
- one that is owned by the kernelClassLoader (or just &quot;kernel&quot;)

When a ProcessClassLoader loads a class (eg. when findSystemClass() is
called in a process), it should check the kernel's class cache first
(this will include JavaProcess) to ensure that class definitions that
*must* be reused conistently are reused. If the class is not in that
cache, the cache for primordial class loaders is used.

&gt;<i> Every
</I>&gt;<i> JavaProcess has a private reference to its classloader, which could be
</I>&gt;<i> used on behalf of the calling process to set whatever statics need to be
</I>&gt;<i> set.  (e.g. SystemObjects.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         Currently, the host code always sets a custom classloader because
</I>&gt;<i> that's the only way to generate (more-or-less) disjoint classloaders.  On
</I>&gt;<i> the native side, that is not the case -- an empty classloader can be
</I>&gt;<i> generated by the decaf code.  (In fact, at some point, must be.)  My
</I>&gt;<i> question, then, is -- does constructProcess() (I think!) ever /need/ to
</I>&gt;<i> set a classloader?  Since the native code must already generate an empty
</I>&gt;<i> primordial classloader for the new process, does the JOS code ever need to
</I>&gt;<i> worry about setting the classloader of the new process?  (That is,
</I>&gt;<i> JavaProcess's private ProcessClassLoader reference would be a reference to
</I>&gt;<i> a native PCL, generated by the native call to createProcess().  (And
</I>&gt;<i> possibly changed to a straight ClassLoader reference.))
</I>
So, what you're saying is JavaProcess will still have a reference to a
ProcessClassLoader, just that the the class loader constructed in the
nativ version will be generated natively by decaf?

That's fine by me. I'm not sure what the advantages of making
NativeProcessClassLoader natively generated are, but feel free to do it
that way if it's easier. I will try to get the Java implementation of
NativeProcessClassLoader working so that it might be useful in the
future.

BTW, if it is implemented in Java, that doesn't mean getClassLoader()
won't return null for classes loaded by a primordial class loader.
Class.getClassLoader() can simply state:

ClassLoader getClassLoader()
	{
	if (classLoader instanceof ProcessClassLoader)
		return null;
	return classLoader;
	}

If we do this, Processmanager.getOwningProcess() needs to be changed too
since it checks if the return value of getClassLoader() is an instance
of ProcessClassLoader. That shouldn't be too difficult to fix.

&gt;<i> A method in
</I>&gt;<i> JavaProcess could be used to set static variables or call static methods
</I>&gt;<i> on its classloader, i.e.:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> myChild.setStaticField( &quot;myRandomStaticClass&quot;, &quot;myRandomStaticField&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>         myRandomSharedObject );
</I>&gt;<i> Object args[1]; args[0] = myPipedInputStream;
</I>&gt;<i> myChild.staticFunction( &quot;java/lang/System&quot;, &quot;setIn&quot;, args );
</I>
Whatever we use to achieve this, it would be nice if it were generic (at
the JavaProcess level). So, it is important that even if a process's
class loader is natively generated, there is still a reference to it.

In this case, setStaticField and staticFunction can still be useful as
convenience methods.

&gt;<i>         Right.  I meant this question in the opposite order -- what does
</I>&gt;<i> decaf need to do before we can rename rheise.os, which entails getting the
</I>&gt;<i> nativ bit working correctly.  Something that decaf needs to do is handle
</I>&gt;<i> native calls correctly.
</I>
If you are going to use rheise.os from decaf, it would seem easier to do
the renaming before you get started. Also, the sooner this stabilises
the sooner I can put it in CVS.

&gt;<i> &gt; Likewise with decaf, which is like Jupiter to my Pluto :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         I believe we've found the codenames for our milestone releases. :)
</I>
Yes! Excellent idea :-)

PS. I have read your Final Summary, but I need to catch up on some sleep
before I look at it in more detail - that'll probably be tomorrow.
sorry!
