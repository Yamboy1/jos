Sounds fine.

&gt;<i> &gt; - I think the mechanism for (1) needs to be investigated further.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Flagging the object is one way to handle it. Another way is to simply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; control &quot;access&quot; to the object. A process can't ordinarily gain access to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an object in another process, so there needs to be some bridge method
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that returns a reference to an object of another process. This method
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can perform access control. The difficulty in flagging is that you can't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simply flag an object as shared because that won't give you access to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; its member variables, or to objects returned by methods on the object
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you do have access to. Flagging is obviously a way to make the system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; safer, but is it really necessary?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Flagging was my suggestiong for an implementation of (1).  With a
</I>&gt;<i> bridge method, once the object has been returned, how does decaf know it
</I>&gt;<i> can be 'illegally' cast?
</I>
If we use a bridge method, that method can perform access control,
meaning decaf itself doesn't need to do access control. So, decaf can
allow illegal casts between any two objects that share the same class
definition, so long as you are &quot;able to gain access to&quot; the object.

There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches but I suspect
implementing access control in a Java method will be simpler than
providing special JVM support. So even if we end up agreeing that
objects must be flagged, I think it might be easier to start with the
simplest implementation.

&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Now, if the client process directly accesses static members, it will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; access the cloned versions that belong to its own process. However, if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you call a method on an object that really belongs to another process,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and that method accesses a static member, then it should access the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; static members of the class in the _other_process. Are there any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problems in implementing that?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	I think it comes out implicitly in the way things are done by the
</I>&gt;<i> interpreter.  The shared object's class references will be resolved in/by
</I>&gt;<i> the classloader which loaded it first, because the CL of an object
</I>&gt;<i> (actually, of its class definition) is never changed.  This should be an
</I>&gt;<i> exact fit for the ownership semantics.  This also means, incidentally,
</I>&gt;<i> that a process that exits can't be cleaned up until we're sure no shared
</I>&gt;<i> object classloaders point at it.  (That is, we have to run a garbage
</I>&gt;<i> collection on process exit.)
</I>
You could provide the option to share objects via weak references (JDK
1.2). In this case, references to the shared object will automatically
become null when the server process exits.

Otherwise, you need to somehow notify the client processes that the
server's dead and they should give up their references. That may mean
that the clients must themselves exit.

Or, another option is to have clients deal with a proxy object that
transparently hooks up to the new version of the shared server object if
the server is simply restarted. This might not work if state information
is lost.

&gt;<i> 	I'll think about how to add this to the summary.
</I>
Ok.

&gt;<i> &gt; Can you point me to these papers? Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/">http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/</A>  has a great deal of information
</I>&gt;<i> about various problems with Java, including the memory model and
</I>&gt;<i> type-safety.  (esp see his paper from the ACM Java Grande conference)
</I>
Thanks. I'll be sure to check it out.
