<PRE>I was reviewing the Java SDK2 1.3.0 (rc2) package &quot;java.lang&quot; source and
found the Shutdown package-private class. It basically handles all hooks
and is responsible for JVM termination. The only thing not done in Java
is a native method called &quot;halt(int status)&quot;. It has a very nice way of
handling all finalization, closing all things that have to be closed,
etc.

The JavaDoc for its class says it's been here since JSDK 1.3, so I
guessed it would be useful to mention it in these mailing lists.

Are we interested, in JOS, to support any parts of SDK 2? Since this
part of the SDK is licensed with source code, there would not be any
legal considerations in adding them to JOS... Also, other nifty features
include the StrictMath class and the &quot;strictfp&quot; attribute of the class
file for Math, the BitSieve, etc.

What do you think?
