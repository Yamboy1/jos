In theory, we can run all AWT-dependent applications on JOS /because/ the
implementation details are completely up to us. We must implement the AWT
peers. We can implement the AWT peers without any native methods.

The AWT peers are an interface, or API. On the other hand, AWT is a
framework, not an API. Swing is a framework. Swing uses AWT.

</I>
Native methods are quite popular with C/C++ programmers. Native methods
might feel better than bytecode for someone trained in the art of C/C++.
Programmers have used native methods even when native methods are not
required. AWT peers are a good example.

After reviewing the Java Virtual Machine Specification again, I make the
following assertion:


AWT peers are not required to implement native methods. As always, native
methods are optional in the implementation of the Java standard class
libraries.


Many, but not all, foreign operating systems have a bit-mapped windowing
system. A bit-mapped windowing system for many mainframe, midrange and
microcomputer servers is simply not an option. For the server itself, it is
neither necessary nor desireable for these computers to have a bit-mapped
windowing system. People sit in front of a local or remote console; nobody
sits in front of the server itself.

On a server farm (or serverfarm-in-a-box), most of the general purpose
processors do not have a bit-mapped windowing system. They have no support
for bit-mapped graphics. They have no monitor, no keyboard, no mouse.
People sit in front of a local or remote console; nobody sits in front of
the server itself.

Any yet, AWT runs successfully on all these machines. A bit-mapped
windowing system is obviously not required to run a virtual machine. While
many virtual machines use them, native peers are not required. For those
without a bit-mapped windowing system, a foreign operating system cannot
provide native peers for a windowing system it does not have.

Peers for JOS are more like peers on OS/400. For example, a pure bytecode
version of the AWT on OS/400 is necessary to separate the process-wide
components in java.awt.* with the session-wide components of
java.awt.peer.*. The OS/400 redirects all AWT &quot;peers&quot; across a TCP/IP
connection. Peers are never displayed on the OS/400 itself.

Peers for JOS are more like peers for X. A native library might be useful
to redirect I/O from a process to the X server. Peers for JOS might skip
the native library altogether and, within bytecode, redirect I/O from a
process to the X server.

Current AWT implementations must use peers because the windowing system is
a system-wide object and AWT is process-wide. Native peers are useful to
cross over from a virtual machine to a foreign operating system. This has
little to do with machine code vs. bytecode.

An AWT peer is a proxy. An AWT peer runs in one process while the real
bit-mapped component runs in another. Let's consider running 100 AWT-based
applications. Each AWT-based application runs in its own process. Each AWT
peer is created in the same process as its application.

A windowing system simultaneously display the output from many other
processes. Like an X service, our windowing system runs in a separate
process, isolated from all other processes. It must be a separate process
in order for a windowing system to be loaded, reloaded, shutdown and
restarted.

When an AWT peer is created, it creates a corresponding component in
service process. An AWT peer must use some form of inter-process
communication to tell the windowing system to create a component. Once a
corresponding component has been created, an AWT peer must continue to use
some form of inter-process communication to paint the display owned by the
windowing system.

To suitably illustrate this, imagine 100 servers and 1 console are wired in
a server farm. For simplicity, imagine each server is running one AWT-based
application. It is desireable to redirect I/O from all 100 servers to a
master console. The master console is the only machine that runs a
bit-mapped windowing service. It can simultaneously display components
created by AWT peers on all 100 servers.
