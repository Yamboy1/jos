findSystemClass() isn't just called to save memory. You *must* call
findSystemClass() on all the linked classes which are to be referenced
by the calling code.

For example, suppose you are loading an applet across a network:

Class appletClass = appletClassLoader.loadClass(className, true);
Applet applet = (Applet)appletClass.newInstance();

When the classloader attempts to define class 'className', it will
attempt to resolve the link to its supperclass Applet. Here, you *must*
load the Applet class using findSystemClass() to ensure that the calling
code is dealing with the same Applet class. If you do not, the next line
will fail. You cannot cast the return value of newInstance() from
Applet(L2) to Applet(L1). You must ensure that Applet in each case is
the *same* class.

Note that there is no second line in Echidna as there is in the above
example. It uses reflection to invoke the main method directly on the
class. This means the two namespaces can be more independent, but the
String array argument means that the String class must be in common (and
all the classes it references, including Object). Also, any exceptions
which the main() method might throw need to be cast to a known type for
the caller to catch. So, at least Throwable needs to be in common, too.

Also, when you consider that it is a security risk to allow user defined
classes to invoke native system methods (eg. you could bypass the
sandbox), various system classes (eg. System) must always be loaded by
the(/a) primordial class loader in order to make use of their native
methods. Of course, in JOS we might have an effective primordial class
loader for each process, so it's ok to reload the System class in each
primordial (JOS-controlled) classloader.

Ideally, separate namespaces should be completely separate, apart from
the classes we *want* to share. Would it be possible to provide a native
method to invoke a program in a new process without requiring any
classes to be in common? It seems that all it needs to do is convert
the String array argument from String(L1) to String(L2). This would seem
safe given that L1 and L2 are primordial class loaders for process 1 and
process 2, and String is a system class.

Now that each process has its own version of EVERY class, we can
consider some memory optimisations. The approach outlined in my last
email might work.

One final thought: if namespaces should be completely separate except
for the classes we *want* to share, then we should consider how we are
going to share those classes. I don't particularly like the method we've
discussed so far because as soon as you share one class, it starts
dragging in everything else with it. Maybe it's possible to convert
SomeClass(L1) to SomeClass(L2) in the same way as I described above for
invoking the main method in a new process. You just need to ensure that
SomeClass(L1) and SomeClass(L2) can be treated as the same class (eg.
check that they were loaded from the same file). I'm not sure whether
&quot;convert&quot; is the right word here. I'd like to &quot;treat&quot; SomeClass(L1) as
SomeClass(L2), sort of like an illegal cast that is approved by the JVM.

&gt;<i> 	This would suggest that Echidna doesn't actually need to wrap
</I>&gt;<i> java.lang.System.  In fact, it would suggest the following code in its
</I>&gt;<i> custom classloaders would be sufficient:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> if ( className == &quot;java.lang.System&quot; ) {
</I>&gt;<i> 	/* fetch java.lang.System from the filesystem... */
</I>
I suspect this won't work (see above) - at least not in a normal JVM.

&gt;<i> &gt; Ideally, you want to limit access to another process's objects to &quot;as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much as is required and no more&quot;. This could be a matter of programming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; style. When message passing between processes, the arguments and return
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; values can be of simple Classes intended only to carry data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	True.  The question then becomes whether or not we want to forbid
</I>&gt;<i> direct object sharing or not; and to do so, I think, would be extremely
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunate.  Direct object sharing is like CORBA, except more so, and KDE
</I>&gt;<i> and GNOME are putting CORBA to work for them in good and interesting
</I>&gt;<i> ways...
</I>
Yes, it is definately useful. I hope the &quot;approved illegal casts&quot; idea
is a way to solve this.
