Let's consider two scenarios. If bytecode has not changed at all, a virtual
machine should not end up with two or more copies of the bytecode in
memory. This is possible by intern'ing all bytecode.

A application needs to have a fresh set of static fields each time it is
loaded. There is no way around that. A custom class loader must re-load
class files from disk every time the application is started -- just in case
the bytecode has changed. When the CLASSPATH is changed in the creation of
a child process, the child process must use its CLASSPATH to load bytecode.
It must re-load class files every time the application is started -- just
in case the bytecode has changed.

When an application is downloaded across the network, a custom class loader
must download class files every time the application is started -- just in
case the bytecode has changed. If there is a HTTP cache between the custom
class loader and the network service, the HTTP cache quickly determines if
the class file has changed.

The bytecode cache could be persistent, too. When the virtual machine is
started, it should pre-cache (intern) all bytecode that has been recently
used.

&gt;<i>Writing a custom classloader, it looks like /nothing/ is shared by default,
</I>&gt;<i>and it's the responsibility of the classloader to be efficient by using
</I>&gt;<i>findSystemClass() if it so desires.
</I>
Is this true of all virtual machines?

Does a virtual machine invoke loadClass() for all classes, even those
loaded by the primordial class loader?

An optimized virtual machine might not invoke the loadClass() method for
classes that have already been loaded by the primordial class loader.
Otherwise, I think you're right.

Certainly, a virtual machine can always create a custom class loader to
load the classes from java.applet, java.awt, java.sql, etc. A primordial
class loader should be an actual Java class. As long as semantics are
preserved, it is not necessary to store all class files in one big archive.
As long as security is preserved, it is not necessary to load all classes
in the java.* packages with a primordial class loader.
