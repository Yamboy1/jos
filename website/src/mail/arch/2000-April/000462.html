<PRE>	(Boy, is this late!)

	OK, just to make sure I got your proposal straight: we have
multiple native primordial classloaders to generate our disjoint
classloaders for multiple processes.  ONLY a NPC may attempt to optimize
memory by sharing a class definition, and ONLY with another NPC, and ONLY
if that class definition is the same, which you propose to decide based on
the archive age and location.  Furthermore, casts between different
classloaders are allowed ONLY if (a) the process has asked for and
recieved permission to directly access objects of another process and
(b) that object's class was loaded by a primordial classloader, AND its
definition shared with the accessor's primordial class loader.

	I checked Serializable and RMI, and RMI is built on Serializable,
which requires that the de-serialization method handle an excess or a
shortage of fields without throwing an exception.  (And that the class to
which you're de-serializing supports a no-argument constructor, presumably
so that it's in a consistent state if the de-serializer can't do anything
useful with it.)  This means that all legacy IPC with objects will be
handled correctly and automatically.

	That is, the only time we intend to allow illegal casts is in the
special case of shared memory, which, existing outside the scope of the
JVM spec, means we can do whatever we want with it.  Our interface to
sharing memory* will necessarily be native, so we can check /when the
object is shared/ if the class definitions in the primordial loaders
(which means they /can't change/) are the same, and allow the share to
take place.  (Naturally, we have to recursively check interfaces and
superclasses.)  This means the interpreter does /not/ have to check
references to an object of a given type as being that given type except
during casts.  (That is, the overhead is marginal, because you only check
for illegal-but-allowed casts during an instanceof operation, which
already takes a 'long' time.)

	So far, so good.  In fact, the VM spec specifically allows the
primordial class loader to be /anything/, going on to say that it usually
loads pre-compiled code from the local filesystem.  So here's the
question: when, if at all, will an application want to use direct object
sharing on a class not located on the local filesystem (by the NPC)?  
Naturally, we can just say never, because the application has to be
specifically written for /our/ shared memory, but we don't want to blindly
impose limitations on JOS.  Let's look at the question another way,
because I'm having a hard time coming up with a good answer: what, if
anything, do we lose by disallowing non-primordial class sharing?  Let's
look at it slowly.  The objective of threading is to share memory between
processes, basically.  So why would separate processes need or want to
share memory?  You never /need/ to share objects, because anything you can
program with shared memory, you can likewise program with message-passing.  
(And vice-versa, actually.)  So you must want to share objects for
efficiency -- but if the two process are pieces of the same program, why
aren't they threads?  The only reasonable answer is efficiency between
separate programs.  (If you can't handle converting statics into variables
on a thread, I'm not sure I want you programming my O/S :)  Seriously, I
can't think of a reason why a single program would /require/ multiple
processes if threads were available.)

	So we're down to the case of efficient communication between
separate programs for when we're looking at when we're allowing illegal
casts, and the question is if separate programs should expect that
custom class-loaded classes be present in other processes.  I think it's
reasonable to say that no programmer would expect his custom class-loaded
classes to cast to someone elses.  (This is not an /exact/ reversal of my
prior position. :))


	*phew*  In short, it seems reasonable to adopt Ryan's proposal
... for a conventional native primordial classloader.  Gilbert's previous
emails offer the intriguing possibility that one could allow Java code to
be the primordial classloader.  Oh, before I go any further -- something
rather important just dawned on me.


	There is NOT necessarily a conflict between a bytecode cache and
Ryan's proposal.  There are two types of 'bytecode' cache, I think: the
first is to cache the whole class, and the second to cache method
bytecode.  I'll address the second one first.  A (shared or not) class
definition (JavaClass) includes a pointer to a MethodList, which in turns
retains pointers to blocks of bytecodes which specific methods execute.  
These bytecode blocks are the only blocks of the classfile which decaf
actually saves -- everything else is converted into an internal form more
amenable to manipulation and (hopefully!) efficiency.  This internal form
-- which is the class definition Ryan and I are now agreeing on how to
share -- replaces the class file bytes.  Now, any shared class
automatically shares its method bytecode, which is the only part of the
classfile bytecode decaf bothers to save.  However, non-shared classes do
/not/ share their method code or class definitions, even if they happen
to be identical.

	Summary: my code, as amended by Ryan's proposal for multiple
processes, already does almost everything a bytecode cache would do.  The
interesting case is sharing bytecode or class definitions between classes
which happen to be identical even if they're not shared.  How could this
be done?  (It may, in practice, depending on the number of custom
clasloaders, not turn out to be useful.)  Every classloader, custom or
not, must eventually call defineClass() on an array bytecode in order to a
Classb object back.  Suppose we insert the bytecode cache there?  (If this
is what you had in mind, Gilbert, my apologies.)  All the bytecode that
passes through defineClass() is intern'd along with the class definition
generated by it, indexed by classname+classloader.  Every time
defineClass() is called (which, requiring a name, won't be horribly
inefficient), the bytecode is checked against the intern'd bytecode.  If
they differ, another entry is added.  If they're the same, the intern'd
class definition (pointer) is returned, and it's used.  Because this only
affects /where the definition is/ (and, in turn, where the bytecode
definition is), it won't change the way the classloader maintains its
tables for checking casts**.  That is, since a classloader caches and
maintains in its name/loader pair tables JavaClassInstances, not
JavaClasses, everything will behave appropriately -- there will still be a
separate entry for separate classloaders.  This cache does NOT remove the
disk access (etc) required to find/generate the bytecode, but it does cut
down on memory footprint, assuming the classfile size is small relative to
the internal representation size * number of duplicates (== number of
custom classloaders); naturally, if this turns out to be inefficient, we
can do something similar for method code only.  (Where the internal rep
and bytecode are identical, so any non-duplication is saving.) Caching the
disk access (etc) is the responsibility of the loader or its
filesystem/URI/compiler/etc.

	
	Returning back to the topic (remember what it was?  I was just
about to tell you about Gilbert's interesting proposal), it seems like we
could implement the primordial classloader in java -- perhaps as a URI
loader -- if, and only if -- it could guarantee correct sharing as Ryan
defined it.  (That is, completely transparent to a custom classloader.)  
That sharing could be none, it could time/location based, or it could be
based on a bytecode cache, so long as the cache maintained coherency
against its source.  (Which may well require it to be a space-only saving
cache!)  The interpreter, frankly, doesn't give a damn.  The primordial
classloader just has to be able to (correctly) hand it JavaClassInstances
upon request.  (And throw the flag in a JavaObject if it's a candidate for
'illegal' casting.**)

-_Quinn

* Where memory and object/field references are isomorphic in Java, which
is why disjoint classloaders are equivalent to processes, which are
defined by separate memory spaces.

** decaf doesn't cache name/loader pairs right now, but it needs to.  I
think, in general, that name/loader pairs can be stuffed into the
ClassLoader class and maintained in calls to defineClass() and imMelting()
calls generated by the garbage collector.  Throwing the &quot;potential illegal
cast&quot; flag in JavaObject changes the cast-checking algorithm to ignore the
second field during its comparisons.
