<PRE>&gt;<i> Question: Starting with an instance of java.lang.Class, is there an easy
</I>&gt;<i> way to get its original bytecode?
</I>
	Not that I'm aware of, though this could probably be added w/o too
much difficulty.

&gt;<i> Question: Why is the access &quot;private&quot; for java.lang.Runtime's only
</I>&gt;<i> constructor? How does a virtual machine extend it without rewriting it from
</I>&gt;<i> scratch?
</I>
	AFAIK, because the native code is not bound by privacy
restrictions.  To my understanding, classpath uses native code in several
places exclusively to get around Sun's poort choices in classes like this
one.
 
&gt;<i> Question: Why is java.lang.Object and java.lang.Class stored inside rt.jar?
</I>&gt;<i> These classes should be stored in the machine code for a virtual machine,
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't they?
</I>
	The compiler needs access to j.l.O and j.l.C, and this removes
(some) class library version dependencies from the compiler.

&gt;<i> Question: Isn't it possible to literally translate bytecode from a class
</I>&gt;<i> file into a C++ program? A few class files could be compiled directly into
</I>&gt;<i> the jJOS/decaf executable image, with no classes.zip file required.
</I>
	Yes.  My approach is (will be) that as long as I'm implementing a
native class anyway, I may as well just write the C++ class for it and
save myself some trouble.


	Processes /are/ very simple, but you must bear in mind that not
every request for a static goes through a classloader.  If application Q
spawns a new process R, R will inherit all of Q's /already loaded/ class
definitions unless specific actions are taken by the native code to
prevent this from happening.  Sun had the native code cache class
definitions -- instead of always passing class use requests to a
classloader -- for several reasons, including efficiency; this is one of
its effects.  (Another reason would include the boot-strapping problem;
beginning with say, a request for j.l.o -- the (java) classloader needs
j.l.o to function, along with several other classes.  Therefore, the
primordial class loader must supply them /before/ the classloader is
called the first time.  (Presumably, for the command-line main-function
containing class.)  (BTW -- decaf doesn't support class loaders at all
right now, which is one reason we need real classlib support.)  Allowing
the classloader to then redefine j.l.o opens any number of gaping security
and consistency holes.)

	But basically, yes, the idea is to alter the classloader and class
definition caching in such a fashion so as to prevent data sharing via
statics; this will probably be best implemented with support from the
class library's classloader.


	As an aside -- the issue of memory architecture.  Virtual memory
(and hence paging) seems like a Good Idea.  However, there is a certain
benefit to having all the (possibly multiple /native) JVMs share a single
address space (provided the memory allocator is aware of this!) -- IPC
becomes blazingly fast, because there's no copy (unless explicitly
programmed) or memory-space-switch involved.  The risk, of course, is
two-fold: (a) decaf makes a bad pointer and scribbles on another JVM's
data.  This is not something I'm terribly worried about (and could
actually be written in to a memory-protection scheme*) because if decaf
scribbles on random memory, it'll nuke itself during single-process
testing anyway.  (b) the same, but with native code we didn't
write.  (e.g. is not known to be 'perfect' anyway)  This requires a
separate address space for safety reasons (e.g. it's not 'kernel' code, so
sandbox it); but since JNI is the IPC for native code, the additional
overhead of copying things around won't be terribly noticeable.  (I
think/hope; I'll have to check the docs again to see what kind of
checking we'd need to do, if any, on objects share with native code.)  The
main reason for multiple native processes is not separate address spaces,
I think, but pre-emptive multi-tasking...
