<PRE>	Is this an accurate summary?

	We agree then -- for Java processes, we need native support to
handle 'illegal' class casts; I proposed a mechanism where only class
definitions that are explicitly shared -- quite possibly by default -- are
considered the same for 'illegal' casts, because byte-for-byte checks are
grossly expensive.  For effiency, we need a mechanism to share class
definitions while maintaining disjoint statics.  These two mechanisms
could be one, where explicitly shared classes share class definitions but
have disjoint statics*, and the default for sharing classes between a
process and its parent will be generous, with separate classloaders, for
maxixum interoperability and utility.  That is, you can allow application
classes to re-load on the fly by garbage collecting that process's
ClassLoader on exit, and if the two processes communicate with Java
objects -- e.g. via Serializable objects and a standard networking layer
-- the classes for the objects will cast to each other.

-_Quinn

* The decaf JVM has explicit support for this.  JavaClass -- the class
definition as derived from its classfile -- is not JavaClassInstance,
which is a JavaClass and a pointer to its static fields (and some other,
irrelevant, things).  (And no, it's not currently coded that a JCI points
to a JC rather than inheriting from it, but that shouldn't be too hard to
put in once I'm sure decaf works -- move the code and data in JC down to a
JC implementation.)
