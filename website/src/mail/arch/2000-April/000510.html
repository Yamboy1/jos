<PRE>We are so close to the right answer.

We must be careful not to add complexity when complexity is not needed. The
minimalist approach is always best. We are looking for the smallest
possible change to the standard Java Virtual Machine Specification to
accomplish multiple Java processes. In short, we only need a few new things:

1. multiple primordial class loaders
2. a process management API, like rheise.os

We only need to optimize the design for a few things:

1. highly optimized protocol stack for inter-process communication
2. bytecode/class definition cache

</I>
Streams, RPC, IPC, RMI and CORBA are fundamental building blocks of shared
objects. &quot;Flagging&quot; an object as shared is un-definable. Very quickly
flagging shared objects gets very complicated. Why re-invent the wheel? We
already have a well-refined inter-machine communication that solves the
inter-process communication problem. A protocol stack, like JEPS, is the
only subsystem that might be optimized for object sharing. It is the
protocol stack and only the protocol stack that can be optimized for a
MPCL-compatible virtual machine.

A protocol stack only shares data, not objects. Therefore, an optimization
of communication between processes within a virtual machine is simple,
direct and follows all of the rules of transparency.

&gt;<i>Whether or not an object can be shared depends on the two processes
</I>&gt;<i>(class loaders) involved. An object in process A may be shared with
</I>&gt;<i>process B if both processes share the same class definition for that
</I>&gt;<i>class. However, process C may have a different (eg. newer) class
</I>&gt;<i>definition for that class and even if the object is flagged, it may not
</I>&gt;<i>be shared with this process. So, if we have a flag, its usefulness is in
</I>&gt;<i>testing if the object may _not_ be shared. The opposite is that it can
</I>&gt;<i>_potentially_ be shared, and the two classes must be checked to see if
</I>&gt;<i>they have the same class definition to be certain that the object can be
</I>&gt;<i>shared.
</I>
An object is by definition 'shared' when it is found in an RMI or CORBA
registry. At a high level, any user process can share an object with any
other process. At a low level, an optimized protocol stack is the only
system component that &quot;knows&quot; that it is running in a MPCL-compatible
virtual machine.

&gt;<i>Another point occurred to me: efficiency may not be that important since
</I>&gt;<i>access to shared objects will be rare (compared with access to objects
</I>&gt;<i>that are in the same process).
</I>
Exactly! The greatest positive impact comes from a protocol stack that
takes advantage of a MPCL-compatible virtual machine. By making the
protocol stack more efficient, we make all applications more efficient,
even RMI and CORBA.

&gt;<i>On the topic of JDK 1.1.x vs. JDK 1.2, rheise.os is currently based on
</I>&gt;<i>JDK 1.1 (which is convenient for decaf). Al Alexis Petrounias pointed
</I>&gt;<i>out to me that his registry depends on JDK 1.2, and to integrate his
</I>&gt;<i>work with mine we will need to either move our base level support to JDK
</I>&gt;<i>1.2, or rewrite his registry to support JDK 1.1. I'm a bit nervous about
</I>&gt;<i>moving to JDK 1.2 just yet, but I'm wondering whether you have a
</I>&gt;<i>different opinion. Is JDK 1.2 realistic for you?
</I>
The multiple primordial class loader (MPCL) design is not limited to one
Java platform. A kernel is not tied to one virtual machine, is it? On one
machine I could run decaf on top of jJOS. On another, I could run an
experimental version of decaf on top of jJOS, right? A kernel is not
reusable if it only runs one virtual machine. All Java platforms must be
implemented eventually, not just one. An open architecture must enable the
link process to determine which virtual machine (if any) is statically
linked to a kernel.

&gt;<i>I must have missed it. We are talking about access to statics of shared
</I>&gt;<i>objects, right?
</I>
We should not tamper with the simplicity of the Java Virtual Machine
Specification. We should not change the semantics of object ownership. All
objects -- with no exceptions -- are owned by their corresponding process.
An object cannot be owned by more than one process. An object cannot
literally be shared, even in a MPCL-compatible virtual machine. It can only
be shared by proxy.

The protocol stack should be able to pass a packet (the value of a byte
array) from one bytecode process to another. A packet does not escape a
virtual machine when it's destination is another process within the virtual
machine. Even when there are multiple virtual machines running on a kernel,
a packet does not escape a kernel when it's destination is another virtual
machine within the kernel. The protocol stack can efficiently copy a byte
array from one process to another by sending a DatagramPacket.

Some objects might not be shareable between Java platforms. The
restrictions on sharing objects is identical to what already exist for
sharing objects between Java platforms. Serialization is not, nor has ever
been, the answer to long-term object persistence. Just as a Java 1.2 client
won't connect to a Java 1.1 RMI service, you can't automatically share
objects between different Java platforms. Many class designs have radically
changed although names are the same. That is fatal to long-term object
persistence.
