<PRE>&gt;<i> I see, I misunderstood. Then when is an object flagged? And what is the
</I>&gt;<i> exact definition of what it means for an object to be flagged?
</I>
	I just wrote some example code and realized something: the
efficiency benefit I was considering is actually rather small, because you
could code the instanceof/checkcast stuff to call a function to compare if
two classes/interfaces are the same, like so:

bool classEQ( dst, src ) {
	if ( dst-&gt;classdefinition == src-&gt;classdefinition ) {
		return true;
		}
	else if ( dst == src &amp;&amp; dst-&gt;classloader == src-&gt;classloader ) {
		return true;
		}
	else {
		return classEQ( dst-&gt;parentclass, src );
		}
	}

	The only additional cost to always allowing illegal casts is the
single if statement at the beginning, which is comparing pointers to
classdefinitions, and is thus cheap.  (With multiple native processes, it
would have to compare GIDs, instead, because pointers aren't unique, but
this applies everywhere I assume they are, like the next if.)

	Originally, I'd been thinking the additional cost for always
allowing illegal casts would be high, but it's not, for two reasons: the
class definition sharing is done at class loading, and second, because our
OO-IPC method secures cross-process object references, we don't have to
worry about security.

	So it turns out I was, in fact, just being totally stupid.

&gt;<i> On the topic of JDK 1.1.x vs. JDK 1.2, rheise.os is currently based on
</I>&gt;<i> JDK 1.1 (which is convenient for decaf). Al Alexis Petrounias pointed
</I>&gt;<i> out to me that his registry depends on JDK 1.2, and to integrate his
</I>&gt;<i> work with mine we will need to either move our base level support to JDK
</I>&gt;<i> 1.2, or rewrite his registry to support JDK 1.1. I'm a bit nervous about
</I>&gt;<i> moving to JDK 1.2 just yet, but I'm wondering whether you have a
</I>&gt;<i> different opinion. Is JDK 1.2 realistic for you?
</I>
	Honestly, I haven't looked at how different (in VM terms) JDK1.2
is from 1.1.x; I'm still not supporting inner classes, either.  I'll look
into, hopefully sometime soon, but I'm not optimistic.  My gut feeling is
that Sun added a great deal of native code to the 1.2 libraries to allow
it do what it does, code that we're not going to port any time
soon.  (and/or that classpath will have implementations of)  The JVM
changes could very well be very minor -- I've been programming out of the
Second Edition VM spec, which I think covers the VM for JDK1.2 -- it, at
least, mentions it fairly often.  Even before I started re-writing decaf,
it didn't support certain things in the spec just because I hadn't gotten
around programming them yet.  Actually, I'm pretty sure the JVM changes
will fairly minor, because otherwise the 1.2 jdk couldn't run 1.1 code :)

&gt;<i> I must have missed it. We are talking about access to statics of shared
</I>&gt;<i> objects, right?
</I>
	Right.  MultipleJavaProcesses is the wiki topic for the text 
of the 'final summary', which seems to me like a good place to put this
kind of consideration; I was just setting up the wiki page as a
possibility for collaboration.
