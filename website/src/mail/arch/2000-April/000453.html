<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Thank you for this discussion on the architecture mailing list. It has been
great. I hope we can keep it going. Today, I have a much better idea about
what it will take to create a multiple process virtual machine.

1. I recommend a &quot;MPCL/M&quot; design for a first pass at jJOS/decaf.

MPLC/M is &quot;multiple primordial class loader in machine code&quot;. Inside the
jJOS/decaf, there is only one machine code process. The kernel and virtual
machine are a primary machine code process. Kernel modules are machine code
extensions. They run within the primary machine code process.

2. I recommend a &quot;MPCL/B&quot; design for a second pass.

MPCL/B is &quot;multiple primordial class loader in bytecode&quot;. MPCL/B -- as far
as I can tell -- depends on our ability to demonstrate MPLC/M. MPLC/M
should come first.

3. I cannot ignore the JNI design.

The JNI design won't go away. The JNI design also provides multiple
bytecode processes within a machine code process. Multiple instances of a
virtual machine is infinitely more complex.

On the other hand, it ensures that each bytecode process has its own heap,
its own garbage collector, its own user interface thread, and its own
finalizer thread.

For more information, see also ProcessDiagramJNI.

4. I stand corrected.

For the first time, I see that it is not necessary to have multiple
instances of a virtual machine to accomplish multiple processes in
bytecode. By constantly chipping away at the assumptions of the Java
Virtual Machine Specification, the JOS Project has convinced me that the
primordial class loader is the critical component.

A virtual machine can have many primordial class loaders. And, these class
loaders can be hybrid classes, implimented partly in machine code and
partly in bytecode.

Enabling more than one primordial class loader seems to be the minimum
clarification to the Java Virtual Machine Specification that give us
multiple bytecode processes.

5. I have been too concerned with efficiency.

I am sorry. I have been working long and hard on the efficiency of a
bytecode cache. We can enjoy multiple processes for a long time before we
need to be concerned with virtual machine efficiency.

IF ONLY we had a virtual memory manager and a 10GB swap partition, we could
load 20+MB of bytecode for each process and really not worry about it.

Before we optimize a bytecode cache, or class definition cache, or class
cache, we should demonstrate a multiple process virtual machine (MPVM).

6. Demonstration

When I boot JOS from the JOS Binary Distribution, it should invoke init. In
turn, init should run a command line shell in a new user process. From the
keyboard, I should be able to type the name of a runnable class using a
line editor. By the way, /all/ implementations of org.jos.program2a.Program
are runnable.

When I press enter, the shell program should create a new user process. The
new user process re-loads parts of the Java standard class library. The
runnable class runs in the new user process.

We should invent the classpath application. The classpath application might
re-set the classpath property of a shell -- for creating user processes in
the future.
