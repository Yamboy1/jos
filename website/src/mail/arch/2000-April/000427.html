<PRE>&gt;<i> Will a new process get started by &quot;forking&quot; an existing process? Will it

</I>
	Luckily, we're not limited to UNIX conventions.  I used fork() as
an example because pretty much everyone knows how it works.  The difficult
part of designing multi-process Java is determining the interface it
should implement.  fork() seems like a good idea, in general; after all,
it's survived for thirty years :)  (BTW -- do you actually want separate
processes, or just separate threads?  Java threading will operate exactly
as it should with decaf, and threads are usually the Right Thing to do if
you need to share alot of information.)  OTOH, something like the
following would also be nice:

	/* myRunnableClass does something useful */
	Thread t = new Thread( new myRunnableClass() );
	/* Starts a clean process and loads t as its single
	   thread.  No data sharing, unless myRunnableClass()'s
	   constructor references something. */
	jos.system.process.startNewProcess( t );
	/* remove the temptation to fiddle with the other process;
	   could this be done by startNewProcess?  (may need
	   a native call) */
	t = null;

	In general, however, I think of processes as being useful mostly
as a distinction between threads which were /not/ explicitly written to
work together -- e.g. grep and less, or the windowing system and the word
processor.  Inside a single application, I think the major utility of
spawning a new process is the ability to skip potential costly (and
generally annoying to program) synchronizations.
