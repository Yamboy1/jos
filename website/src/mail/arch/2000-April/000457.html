<PRE>&gt;<i> 1. I recommend a &quot;MPCL/M&quot; design for a first pass at jJOS/decaf.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. I recommend a &quot;MPCL/B&quot; design for a second pass.
</I>
	I agree.  (2) will require native support, but it should be
relatively easy to adapt the code from (1), and I think we'll have a
better idea of what needs to happen after working with (1).

&gt;<i> The JNI design won't go away. The JNI design also provides multiple
</I>&gt;<i> bytecode processes within a machine code process. Multiple instances of a
</I>&gt;<i> virtual machine is infinitely more complex.
</I>
	Indeed, and since our kernel doesn't support multiple native
processes yet, I think we can safely ignore if for now.  Again -- once
(1) is done, this should become clearer.

&gt;<i> For the first time, I see that it is not necessary to have multiple
</I>&gt;<i> instances of a virtual machine to accomplish multiple processes in
</I>&gt;<i> bytecode. By constantly chipping away at the assumptions of the Java
</I>&gt;<i> Virtual Machine Specification, the JOS Project has convinced me that the
</I>&gt;<i> primordial class loader is the critical component.
</I>
	Now that we agree on /what/ we're doing, we just need to agree on
/how/ to do it. :)

&gt;<i> A virtual machine can have many primordial class loaders. And, these class
</I>&gt;<i> loaders can be hybrid classes, implimented partly in machine code and
</I>&gt;<i> partly in bytecode.
</I>
	I might even say /ideally/ are hybrid classes, because the native
code allows great integration with the JVM and the bytecode allows for
more adaptable control.

&gt;<i> Enabling more than one primordial class loader seems to be the minimum
</I>&gt;<i> clarification to the Java Virtual Machine Specification that give us
</I>&gt;<i> multiple bytecode processes.
</I>
	It's enabling /disjoint/ classloaders that is the minimum
clarification (good word:)) to the JVM spec that allows multiple
bytecode processes.  Implementation of disjoint classloaders (without
breaking compatibility) requires multiple primordial classloaders*.

&gt;<i> I am sorry. I have been working long and hard on the efficiency of a
</I>&gt;<i> bytecode cache. We can enjoy multiple processes for a long time before we
</I>&gt;<i> need to be concerned with virtual machine efficiency.
</I>
	OTOH, we /do/ need efficient virtual machines.  My development
machine has 'just' 128 MB of RAM, so I'll be forced to write efficient
processes just to get anything done.  And don't apologize, especially for
working hard!  Trying to explain my ideas (and failing!) to you and Heise
have helped my clarify them and realize where I've been wrong.  Hopefully,
we'll be needing efficiency soon...

&gt;<i> Before we optimize a bytecode cache, or class definition cache, or class
</I>&gt;<i> cache, we should demonstrate a multiple process virtual machine (MPVM).
</I>
	Yes, we should.  Which means I should really get cranking on
finishing the interpreter...

&gt;<i> When I press enter, the shell program should create a new user process. The
</I>&gt;<i> new user process re-loads parts of the Java standard class library. The
</I>&gt;<i> runnable class runs in the new user process.
</I>
	Right on.  The big demonstration, though, is to pipe one
application's System.out to another's System.in -- something that nobody
else can do in a single JVM.

The steps we need to take, then, are:

(1) Allow multiple independent native/primordial classloaders.  Already done.
(2) Allow Java code access to this new native power.  Either have it
framed as a request to generate a new process, which returns a Process
object (of some kind or another -- Gilbert, I believe you have a sketch of
this class somewhere?), or frame it as a request to the classloader
constructor, do I get a new primordial loader or not?  We need to
decide; and since whatever we pick is pretty much 'just' an API issue, it
can change if it doesn't work out.
(3) Write a shell.  (Gilbert, this is right up your alley; it would
basically suck input from System.in and pass it onto the browser, right?)
(3A) This would, BTW, require that the consoles handle converting keyboard
events into System.in and System.out into write requests.  (I think this
would be a better place to put it than in each shell, but I may be wrong.)
(3B) Make sure the shell redirects standard input and output as necessary.
(4) Get decaf to the state where init will set up the console and keyboard
drivers, and start 'login' on each of the consoles (or something
appropriately ad-hoc), where login then sleeps waiting for the shell it
started to end.
(5) make 'generateRandomGarbageOnStdOut | sortStdIn' work :)

That would conclude the demonstration.

Further work:

(6) Allow 'illegal' casts.  This won't be a problem until the processes
start dumping Serializables down the pipes.
(7) Do something more efficient than completely cleaning out each new
primordial loader.


	I think we all agree (more or less) on (1) to (5), and that we're
all still hacking away at (6) and (7), which are closely related.  More on
them from me later :)

* Now that I'm thinking about it a little more, since classloaders can't
be disjoint unless their primordial loaders are (or don't have any classes
loaded, which can't (normally) happen), the two statements are
equivalent.  That is, disjoint classloaders require multiple primordial
classloaders, and multiple primordial classloaders, in turn, generate
disjoint classloaders.
