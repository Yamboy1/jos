<PRE>&gt;<i> It seems to make sense for the static initializer to handle it all, as
</I>&gt;<i> it does in classpath. It calls on FileDescriptor.in to initialise
</I>&gt;<i> System.in and it could do a similar thing for system properties (and the
</I>&gt;<i> security manager in some cases). We just need to set up those data
</I>&gt;<i> sources before System is initialised. This should be quite easy in the
</I>&gt;<i> nativ implementation (through native methods), although a bit tricky for
</I>&gt;<i> host (which I think I'll leave as it is). I wouldn't mind at all if
</I>&gt;<i> someone else did the native version :-)
</I>
	I wasn't particularly expecting you to handle the native-side of
the nativ implementation :)  Yes, it looks like we may be able to set
things up elsewhere (may have to set things up elsewhere); and we do want
to avoid changing classpath as much as possible, so as to reduce our
maintenance workload.  With respect to using setIn(), etc, I was trying to
say that, in general, we should use the interfaces provided by the class
to modify it.

&gt;<i> I am thinking that the class definition resides in a cache separate from
</I>&gt;<i> all processes. Only actual java.lang.Class-es reside in a place
</I>&gt;<i> associated with a particular process. (see below for a further analysis
</I>&gt;<i> of class definition caches)
</I>
	OK -- the way I phrased the 'final summary' leaves open the
question of whether or not the definition cache is system wide.  As long
as we distinguish between revisions, I think we'll be OK.  (I need to
think this through more, probably.)

&gt;<i> When a ProcessClassLoader loads a class (eg. when findSystemClass() is
</I>&gt;<i> called in a process), it should check the kernel's class cache first
</I>&gt;<i> (this will include JavaProcess) to ensure that class definitions that
</I>&gt;<i> *must* be reused conistently are reused. If the class is not in that
</I>&gt;<i> cache, the cache for primordial class loaders is used.
</I>
	Architecturally, I think it would work better to have the
primordial class loader check the kernel's class definition cache
first.  (I'm not sure we want system-wide statics, but I'm open to being
convinced.)

	The kernel classloader could be just about anything -- the first
native primordial classloader to be created; a specific class that uses
the ramdisk generated by the bootloader; a specific class that uses
Gilbert's rater intriguing DATA-section bytecode resource; and so
on.  Since each process has a primordial classloader, and the primordial
classloaders are all generated by code we control, we can simply insert
the necessary shares before handing the classloader back to the Java
program. 

&gt;<i> So, what you're saying is JavaProcess will still have a reference to a
</I>&gt;<i> ProcessClassLoader, just that the the class loader constructed in the
</I>&gt;<i> nativ version will be generated natively by decaf?
</I>
	Exactly.  Every JavaProcess needs a new primordial classloader, so
decaf may as well supply it when the JP is created.  Every
NativeProcessClassLoader must be (access) a primordial loader
anyway; doing the creation with the creation of a JP eliminates the
bootstrap problem.

&gt;<i> So, it is important that even if a process's class loader is natively
</I>&gt;<i> generated, there is still a reference to it.
</I>
	I agree.  I was suggesting that native generation could sidestep
some problems with doing the code in Java, create the native primordial
classloader and assign the JP PCL reference to it.

&gt;<i> If you are going to use rheise.os from decaf, it would seem easier to do
</I>&gt;<i> the renaming before you get started. Also, the sooner this stabilises
</I>&gt;<i> the sooner I can put it in CVS.
</I>
	True.  We'll see what happens.
