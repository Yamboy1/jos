<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm not sure exactly what you meant. Each instance of java.lang.Class must
</I>&gt;<i> allocate enough space for its static fields. A class loader indirectly
</I>&gt;<i> allocates static fields when it defines a class.
</I>
	The classloader only sees System.in/out/err once, the first time
System is loaded, and odds are System will be loaded by the primordial
classloader first.  Yes, all static fields are associated with a
classloader, but only because the identity of each JavaClassInstance has
to do with the classloader it was loaded by.  You can't adjust static
fields on the fly from the classloader.

&gt;<i> The best-case scenario is this: application Q is loaded by one custom class
</I>&gt;<i> loader and process R is loaded by another. R's class loader determines
</I>&gt;<i> which classes, if any, of Q should be reused.
</I>
	Indeed.  That custom classloader must use native methods provided
by JOS in order to redefine already-present classes.  No class in a JVM
may be defined more than once -- in fact, no class in a JVM will ever be
implicitly requested more than once.

&gt;<i> 2. A heavy-weight process has its own address space. This is a defense
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism for machine code.
</I>
	And let me re-emphasize that it is ONLY necessary for machine
code.  Virtually everything else is simpler, more elegant, and more
efficient in a single address space.  The desire for heavy processes in
Java -- which are defined by disjoint classloaders, as adjusted by
JOS-aware programs -- stems from the desire to use Java programs which are
not aware of JOS without having to write native processes and complicated
IPC code for efficiency between different JVM processes.  Native processes
are not strictly necessary to the proper functioning of JOS; ideally, the
only native code is in the kernel, the interpreter, and the class library,
all of which have to be Right anyway. 


	You have come to the same conclusion that I did about a year ago
when I first proposed Java processes for decaf -- that the classloaders
are the important element, and proper manipulation of them allows
transparent operation of multiple Java processes in the same
JVM.  To quote you:

&gt;<i> Theory: When a request for a new java.lang.System class is passed to the
</I>&gt;<i> custom class loader, the custom class loader can ignore findSystemClass()
</I>&gt;<i> and use defineClass() to define a new instance of the java.lang.System
</I>&gt;<i> class.
</I>
	What I meant by saying that not all statics go through a
classloader is that there will /never/ be a request for a 'new'
java.lang.System class made by the interpreter, according to my
understanding of the spec*.  Explicit request may be made by Java code,
which would generate an appropriate java.lang.Class object instantiating
the new System class -- but the bytecode which uses System, the bytecode
for which you're defining a new System class -- calls System implicitly,
that is, System.out.println( &quot;Hello, world!&quot; ); not by
mySystemClass.getField(&quot;out&quot;).println(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);.  It is possible
(in fact, relatively simple) for the native code to adjust what classes
are defined, but ONLY IF the two conflicting class definitions can never
meet -- e.g. are in different Java processes.  This adjustment would take
place at the behest of, for example, Runtime.getRuntime.exec() -- or other
interfaces we deem appropriate.

PS -- I looked at the code for jshell, and it doesn't do redirects for
programs invoked with main(String[]) -- which is the prime example we've
been talking about w.r.t. rewriting statics.  I checked and can no longer
find Echnida/Enchida on the web anywhere -- anyone have a URL?

* My understanding is based on the following sections from the Java
Virtual Machine Specification Second Edition and the Java Language
Specification, as amended to reflect Java 1.1 and corrected.  [Warning --
this is going to take quite a while, so bear with me.]

	Section 5.3.1 of the JVM/2 spec:

First, the Java virtual machine determines whether the bootstrap class
loader has already been recorded as an initiating loader of a class or
denoted by N. If so, this class or interface is C, and no class creation
is necessary. 

Otherwise, the Java virtual machine performs one of the following two
operations in order to load C:

1.The Java virtual machine searches for a purported representation of C in
a platform-dependent manner.
...
2.The bootstrap class loader can delegate the loading of C to some
user-defined class loader L by passing N to an invocation of a loadClass 
method on L.

	That is, nothing ever loaded into the bootstrap (==primordial)
classloader can be replaced by the JVM.  Once a user-defined classloader
is loaded, the JVM, at its discretion, may ask that classloader to find a
class for it.  Similarly, in 5.3.2:

The following steps are used to load and thereby create the nonarray class
or interface C denoted by N using a user-defined class loader L. 

First, the Java virtual machine determines whether L has already been
recorded as an initiating loader of a class or interface denoted by N. If
so, this class or interface is C, and no class creation is necessary.

	That is, the JVM checks /its own/ cache to see if this classloader
at any time ever handled a sucessful request for the requested class, and
if so, uses the class returned by that request.  Section 12.2 of the JLS
makes this clear:

A Java Virtual Machine system should maintain an internal table of classes
and interfaces that have been loaded for the sake of resolving symbolic
references. Each entry in the table should consist of a fully qualified
class name (as a string), a class loader, and a Class object. Whenever a
symbolic reference to a class or interface is to be resolved, a class
loader is identified that is responsible for loading the class or
interface, if necessary. The table should be consulted first, however; if
it already contains an entry for that class name and class loader, then
the class object in that entry should be used and no method of the class
loader should be invoked. If the table contains no such entry, then the
method loadClass (20.14.2) of the class loader should be invoked, giving
it the name of the class or interface. If and when it returns, the class
object that it returns should be used to make a new entry in the table for
that class name and class loader.

	Section 5.3.4 of the JVM spec explicitly states that no two
classloaders may attempt to define the same class differently: &quot;It is
essential that any type name N mentioned in the field or method descriptor
denote the same class or interface when loaded by L1 and when loaded by
L2.&quot;

	From section 5.2:

The Java virtual machine starts up by creating an initial class, which is
specified in an implementation-dependent manner, using the bootstrap class
loader (5.3.1). The Java virtual machine then links the initial class,
initializes it, and invokes its public class method void main(String[]).
The invocation of this method drives all further execution. Execution of
the Java virtual machine instructions constituting the main method may
cause linking (and consequently creation) of additional classes and
interfaces, as well as invocation of additional methods.

In some implementations of the Java virtual machine the initial class
could be provided as a command line argument, as in JDK releases 1.0 and
1.1. Alternatively, the initial class could be provided by the
implementation. In this case the initial class might set up a class loader
that would in turn load an application, as in the Java 2 SDK, Standard
Edition, v1.2. Other choices of the initial class are possible so long as
they are consistent with the specification given in the previous
paragraph.


	The conclusion is that no legal java program may alter the classes
loaded in order to link and initialize the initial class -- e.g. 'init' --
or any classes loaded in order to link and initialize whatever classloader
the program may then define, or, once and supposing that custom
classloader has and maintains full control over loading classes, any
classes it defines in response to loadClass() calls, whether from the JVM
or from Java code.  It is necessary -- and explained in great detail in
&quot;Dynamic Class Loading in the Java Virtual Machine&quot; by Sheng
Liang and Gilad Bracha (Proceedings of the 1998 ACM SIGPLAN Conference on
Object-Oriented Programming Systems, Languages and Applications) -- that
once a class is defined, it is defined &quot;forever&quot;.  It is, a matter of
fact, not only sufficient for classloaders to be disjoint for a pair of
Java threads to be different processes, Java threads with disjoing
classloaders are /required/ to be in different processes!

	The issue of type-safety (and correctness!) /requires/ that
processes which wish to share Java objects either via direct references or
via the Serializable interface share class definitions for the shared
objects' classes /and every class referenced in its resolution/.  This is
where you begin to want finer control over what classes your child process
starts with in its classloader.  In general, there will be a subset of
classes whose proper functioning /requires/ that the JVM rewrite their
classloader (e.g. System.in/out/err; though this can be done by cloning
and calling setIn/Out/Err, it amounts to the same thing) caches.  Except
for these, the default ought to be to share everything else, with the
application specifically mentioning the exceptions -- e.g. classes it
loaded which have statics.


	To summarize again -- and I know I'm dragging on here, but I
wanted to be as explicit as possible here -- multiple java processes, to
my understanding, requires native support, because you can't redefine an
already-loaded class, which is necessary for the simulation of an
independent virtual machine.  The concept -- (partially) disjoint class
loaders -- is simple and elegant, but the implementation, because of the
requirements for compatibility and type-safety, is not.
