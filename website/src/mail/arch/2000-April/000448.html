I may have misunderstood.

I agree that our requirement for maintaining statics is identical to a
conventional JVM. That is a good thing, too. We won't have to change much
to get multiple processes within a virtual machine after all. In fact,
that's why I asked if it really is *that* simple.

In a process environment, the findSystemClass() method must be re-worked.
It must always return a process-wide class. The java.lang.ClassLoader class
is the base class for all other class loaders. It must be re-written to
find the class loader for the process. The findSystemClass() method might
look something like this:

  public static Class findSystemClass( String className ) 
      throws ClassNotFoundException {
    Process p = jos.process.getCurrentProcess();
    ClassLoader loader = p.getClass().getClassLoader();
    if ( this == loader ) {
      throw new ClassNotFoundException( className );
    }
    return loader.loadClass( className );
  }

This again implies that the primordial class loader should be a real Java
class. A class loader can be written to load class files based on
CLASSPATH. It can load class files from archives (.cab, .jar and .zip). It
can load classes from package files (.package).

The primordial class loader should be a real Java class -- even if it
defines some native method to load classes.

A primordial class loader is a JVM-specific class. It could be compatible
with the BCNI, like this:

  public void example() {
    Factory factory = Factory.getFactory();
    ClassLoader loader = factory.getObject( &quot;java.lang.ClassLoader&quot; );
    :
  }

-----

Let me put it this way. I want to continue to use my Java-based HTTP
service on JOS. My Java-based HTTP service uses many custom class loaders,
one for each servlet. A custom class loader is required so that a servlet
can be loaded, unloaded and re-loaded without taking the HTTP service down.

When I run my HTTP service as a JOS process, I'm not asking for a radical
change in the way a class loader works. As we agree, it is identical to a
conventional virtual machine.

When my HTTP service loads a servlet, the custom class loader indirectly
determines if it requires separate statics. It determines which classes are
loaded with findSystemClass() and which ones are not.

Maybe there are two ways to use class loaders. There is the conventional
way of using class loaders. The standard way is highly valued for web
browsers and HTTP services. It includes this:

A. All class loaders shared the Java standard class library.
B. All classes shared java.lang.System and java.lang.Runtime.

Then, there is the unconventional way of using class loaders.

A. Each process has it own instance of the Java standard class library.
B. Within a process, all classes share java.lang.System and java.lang.Runtime.
