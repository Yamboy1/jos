I didn't really &quot;move&quot; to doing that. The System wrapper class is used
99% of the time (which is good because it prevents one process from
writing over the System.in that is being used by another process), and
the static field wrappers are used as a fallback for the other 1% of the
time.

When these fallback wrappers are used, there is still a chance things
can go wrong, for example if &quot;system&quot; code calls setIn() or any of the
other set methods. Luckily I don't think there is any system code that
does this. Another thing that could go wrong is if system code tries to
set the security manager. It is usually expected that no security
manager is set, however I must set the security manager to something so
I can do forwarding. I emulate a null security manager with
NullSecurityManager. However, if any system code tries to call
setSecurityManager() it will fail. So, any code that wishes to call
setSecurityManager() must belong to a user process which has its own
System (wrapper) class and an actual 'null' for the security manager
(which is 99% of the time).

By the way, the only reason I am able to load my own System class and
have it work 99% of the time is that java.lang.System is a purely static
class. There are no instances of System, and so there are no references
to System objects. If there were references to System objects, rheise.os
would fail when you tried to pass in a reference to a System object
owned by your process into a method in a class loaded by the host
primordial class loader (ie. system code). That was the original insight
that led me to this solution.
