>Incidentally, the JJOS module download link seems to be broken.

Thank you, Dan Creswell! The link to JJOS should have been JJOS, not jjos.

(Unfortunately, the link to JJOS module download *was* broken. It is fixed.
This link and others is on the JOSDistribution1e page.)

I've always been interested in the Device Driver architecture, but recently
my time has limited me to being a silent witness to the ongoings in JOS.

Subject: [JOS-Arch] Program and ProgramContext

I like the Program and ProgramContext framework because it is scaleable.
One program can invoke another infinitely. It is easy for a program in one
process to invoke a program in another.

I have, for example, written a program-script class that enables me to run
a list of programs, one after the other, in batch. The default behavior for
my script is this: it stops when the first program "returns" a non-zero
result code.

I am using Program and ProgramContext as the basis of TestProgram and
TestSuite. Since Universal Browser runs any Program, it runs any
TestProgram. Since TestSuite is-a TestProgram, which is a Program,
Universal Browser runs any TestSuite, too.

While my program-script class stops on the first non-zero result code,
TestSuite is different. It keeps going. A test suite "prints" the result
code after running each test program.

I would like to see a comprehensive test suite for virtual machine. I would
like to see a test suite based on a Program, rather than a Java application.

I use any tool that works. If it works, it works. It doesn't matter if it
is fasionable or out-of-style. On a typical day, I start the Universal
Browser from my OS shell. I run Program(s) from my OS shell and Universal
Browser throughout the day. At the end of the day, I'll close the Universal
Browser.

Subject: [JOS-Arch] [Distribution Group] View source

We have added a new feature to our website. Since the JOS Project is an
open source project, we have made the source code available on-line as HTML
pages.

Take a look at the results for yourself at
<URL:http://www.jos.org/redist/src/>.

These static HTML pages were created by WebSource, a free license and open
source product. It is coming soon to the JOS Project. It is written in the
Java programming language.

The new directory features a complete package index at
<URL:http://www.jos.org/redist/src/allpackages.html>. Unlike the Packages
or FullPackageIndex articles on JOS Wiki, this index shows all packages
that have been redistributed.

-----

WebSource automatically creates links between classes. When a class imports
another, the import statement is a link to the source code of the other
class. When a class uses another, a link is written into the HTML page
where the other class is used.

WebSource understands import statements. You can have classes with the same
name in different packages and WebSource won't get confused.

WebSource reads certain configuration options out of a project-by-project
configuration file. The tag line at the top of each HTML page is read out
of the configuration file.

WebSource is a JOS program. It extends
org.jos.gchii.smartprogram2a.BaseConsoleProgram. It uses the model of
Program and ProgramContext. You can run WebSource from the Universal Browser.

-----

If your source code is out-of-date in the new directory, please let me know.
