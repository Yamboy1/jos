how is this different from standard inheritance? java calls
test3.main(args) since it doesnt have one it uses the one in test1.
needles to say Im somewhat confused

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Since applications, applets, servlets and aglets are different kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;programs&quot;, it becomes possible to unify all programs under a program API.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; A program browser would provide a host environment for running (and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; debugging!) all kinds of programs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;this would only be internal, right? I mean you have the program
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;interface then you have an ApplicationProgram that runs a java app as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;program or a ServletProgram, so that all programs can be handled the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;same way internally; and still allow for the prospect of someone making
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;his app a program or use programs as plugins or whatever...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Internal? No, I don't think so. All &quot;programs&quot; can be handled the same way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ApplicationProgram? That's exactly right. Using the reflection API, a
</I>&gt;<i> single implementation of Program is ApplicationProgram. It can run any
</I>&gt;<i> traditional Java &quot;application&quot; that declares a public static main( String[]
</I>&gt;<i> ) method.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using the strong servlet model, we need an implementation of Program called
</I>&gt;<i> ServletProgram, so that all servlets are automatically compatible with
</I>&gt;<i> Program and ProgramContext.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For application programmers that want to implement Program directly, they
</I>&gt;<i> can quickly build programs with full support for inheritence.
</I>
we should also have a ProgramRunner application for non-JOS systems...
(hell, maybe it could even be used in JOS)
 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It would be a bad thing if your shell launches a sub-program that calls
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; System.exit() with a result code. Your shell would end prematurely.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The Security manager would deny that request in a properly designed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;shell, or it would simply run the app in its own process
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Programs, with their own ProgramContext, do not have to be sandboxed. The
</I>&gt;<i> security manager should not get in the way. Neither an &quot;application&quot; nor
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;program&quot; should run inside a sandbox. When you write a program, you should
</I>&gt;<i> not call System.exit() unless you want to close the shell.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It would be a bad thing for your servlet to call System.exit() with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; result code. It would end the servlet enviroment prematurely. Servlets are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; expected to use an &quot;honor system&quot; among serlet programmers, instead of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; security system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I was under the impression that servlets were sandboxed when it came to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;stuff like that
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Servlets work because they were not sandboxed. Servlets run just like a
</I>&gt;<i> Java application. Your servlet has access to JDBC, ODBC, sockets, threads,
</I>&gt;<i> class loaders--you name it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I very much prefer to run my servlets on the client-side. The servletrunner
</I>&gt;<i> tool runs on all clients with no problem. That sure makes it easier to
</I>&gt;<i> distribute the processing load of a large distributed application.
</I>
ok, this is &quot;askin' for a hurtin'&quot; as they say, you dont need to be
sandboxed to deny somenone access to something; thats why we have
permissions. I mean say Im running a site that offers people free
webspace and the abillity to make their own servlets (why arent there
any!?) I want to be able for people to install their own servlets
without them being able to close the whole webserver on a whim, so I
tell the security manager just to end that servlet if it calls
System.exit(), in a shell you could probably get the exit code and
return it as an int to the shell...

&gt;<i> &gt;but it would support legacy by saying &quot;oh, this is an Applet that doesnt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;implemtn Program, Ill use the AppletProgram class to proxy and load
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;it...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly! Program and ProgramContext is just a start. It provides a way to
</I>&gt;<i> make JOS backward- and forward-compatible.
</I>
hey, a few emulators and we'll run everything! :)
 
&gt;<i> &gt;package digigod.apps;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;public abstract class Application {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;}
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is a difference between your Application and mine. My Application is
</I>&gt;<i> an interface, not abstract class. It must be an interface because any class
</I>&gt;<i> can act like an application. Any class can implement my Application
</I>&gt;<i> interface, even an applet or Java Bean. It looks something like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> public interface Application
</I>&gt;<i>     extends Runnable {
</I>&gt;<i>   public Console getConsole();
</I>&gt;<i>   public void setConsole( Console v );
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's it. Since an &quot;application&quot; is expected to never fail, there is no
</I>&gt;<i> result code. Since my &quot;applications&quot; never expect parameters, no parameters
</I>&gt;<i> are passed. There is no equivalent application context.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This interface has served me very well. I type in the name of an
</I>&gt;<i> application and my application browser runs it. There is a little more to
</I>&gt;<i> my Application interface because I have a Console interface that's
</I>&gt;<i> preferrable to standard out:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> public interface Console {
</I>&gt;<i>   public void println( String v );
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have developed many implementations of Console over time. An application
</I>&gt;<i> is not expected to set its own console; the application environment
</I>&gt;<i> provides one.
</I>
My Application class is just a way to make it easier to program the
&quot;standard java app&quot;, I was assuming it could work with your program
interface...

public abstract class ApplicationProgram extends Application implements
Program {...}

then:

public abstract class JOSApplication extends ApplicationProgram {...}

when you use my class your class IS-A Application, with your interface
it IS-A program. it can also be both.

you use my class when your making an application, when it IS-A
application and nothing else; it might HAS-A JFrame or whatever, but it
IS-A application. I think all the sub-components of an application
should also be applications. like the image format converter dialog in a
paint program should run stand-alone just as well, with java this is
easy, slap on a main() with your program interface this is easier.
