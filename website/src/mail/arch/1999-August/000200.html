<PRE>well, I decieded to do some more work on GSI. I have a pretty solid
class of classes, but until now they were basically method-free.

to refresh your memory/bring-up-problems-I've-encountered-so-far:

we have the ScriptLoader thats like a ClassLoader for scripts, should we
have a SCRIPTPATH?

we have Script, how do we allow interaction generically? and its
top-level inner class Element, we have an element what do we do with it?
(goes with genric interaction above)

an Object can be Scriptable if it has a ScriptInfo getScriptInfo(), but
what goes in ScriptInfo? (I'd just use BeanInfo but its to different)

lets look at the life of the script to reflect on these problems:

ScriptLoader is asked to load a script, it finds the appropriate child
(ie LuaScriptLoader for a lua script) and calls load (returning a Script
object cast up from, using my previous example, a LuaScript). Gilbert,
how could your SmartFactory be used here?

Our program now has a Script, to run it calls execute(). is there a
better way? how does it interact with the script when its executing?
what happens when its done? if we call execute() again what happens,
what should?

and for the miscellany:

what if we have two seperate implementations from different authours,
how do we determine which to use? 

how do we tell what type of script a file is? MIME? attributes builtin
to the fs? a per directtoy DB containg info the files (I like it,
cross-fs. doesnt Jigsaw do this?)?

how do other systems like this work?

in langauges already written-for/ported-to Java work? are there
languages you can think of that wouldnt work in this GSI?

how many more questions can I ask before I run out? ...oh, thats it
then....

Cheers,
DigiGod

	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
