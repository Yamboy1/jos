Hmm... that is like saying &quot;My keyboard and my shoe are both made out of
matter, so why can't I operate them in a unified way?&quot;

A shoe is useful when it is attached to a foot. Without this special
environment, there's not much you can do with a shoe. (sort of like an
applet)

A keyboard is an interface to functionality contained in a mysterious
box. It has a Print Screen key that executes a function. (sort of like a
program/command)

Now, there is not much use in strapping a keyboard to your foot and
seeing where that gets you.

Similarly, I can't plug the lace of my shoe into a computer and do
anything useful.

{{ There are exceptions, of course, where shoes and keyboards can be
used in creative ways. I feel that your unified Program interface is
only useful for these exceptions. }}

On the contrary. You misunderstand Sun.

Yes, you can run a servlet on your computer, but that makes your
computer the server. You can also run a webserver on the client-side.
You don't need to connect to a remote host, you can run everything
locally. That also makes you the server.

Of course, the reason for connecting to a remote host is that that is
where the stuff is hosted. That's the World Wide Web. A servlet may
process data stored on the host's database and generate an HTML display
of that data. Because the database contains confidential information
(eg. credit card numbers) it would be behind a firewall so that the only
way to access public data is through the servlet interface.

That is what servlets are useful for - server side processing. You can't
simply run the servlet locally, you also need to set up the environment
which it depends on - the database server/middleware, other servlets
that it potentially interacts with, other computers behind the firewall
that provide other services. Yes, I have worked on real life servlets
that do all of these things.

On another topic, servlet invocation is unique in that when you invoke a
servlet, it may already be running. Once a servlet is activated, it
stays alive to process subsequent requests by different users. The
servletrunner is not a way to run servlets from the command line. It is
a way to start the servlet engine. The way to run a servlet is through a
specialised interface such as a web browser, or an email client. Even
within the servlet architecture there can be different types of servlets
that are operated through entirely unrelated interfaces.

{{ Before you reply to the list, you can ask me any questions personally
if I haven't explained something clearly. Otherwise this thread could go
on forever! }}
