<PRE>This is a big cut-n-paste job responding to lots of good ideas brought
forward.

JavaOS had good ideas in the way of structuring their device drivers so they
hung off of base drivers, but I recall that when I looked over them about a
year ago, something about them just didn't click well with me.  Maybe I'm
just too jaded (no pun intended) and I prefer to reinvent the wheel.

</I>
So, then the absolute Generic Device is a non-stream, then an immediate (or
close to immediate) subclass would be Stream Device and Event Device?  Works
for me.

hasDriver() *may* be appropriate for many devices (like HardDrive device - I
wouldn't like multiple drivers, unaware of each other, messing around at
low-level at the same time, but I don't care how many drivers listen to the
MouseDevice).  isLoaded(), I feel, may be a reiterative method: if the
Driver can find the device, it has been loaded.  Or maybe I'm not seeing
something with this.  I dunno.

&gt;<i>For autodetection mechianism, should we put it into generic driver spec. ?
</I>it
&gt;<i>depends.
</I>
Auto-detection is a crazy thing.  Plug-n-play, USB, and many other &quot;smart&quot;
bus devices are easily detected.  But we don't want to load every known
plug-n-play device or driver into memory just to find out that we have a
&quot;PCI Bridge&quot; device.  This kind of detection needs to be oriented to the
&quot;PCIDevice&quot;, which, although this Device can't be directly implemented in a
Driver as it has no real use outside detection, is solely responsible for
checking the PCI bus for devices, and telling the system of their existence.
This is where the Device Tree comes into effect.  JavaOS and Windoze 9x have
this tree, although they implement it far differently.

For devices which are not inherently auto-detectable, like legacy ISA cards,
parallel port daisy-chain attachments, and so on, we *do* need to load every
device into memory to check for its existence.  More practically, we can
load a virtual device (similar to our PCIDevice above) which is aware of
many of the devices which can be attached to itself, and it handles the
detection, or loads another device to do more detection.  As a last resort,
we can have the user as a kind of device to manually tell the system that a
device exists.

All in all, I believe that the detection and setup should be done at the
device level.  That was my initial intention in creating this separation
between the driver and the device.

See Hilary's response above.

Ok.  Last time.  This is your class.  This is your class on JOS.  Any
questions?  But seriously, here's snippets from my old code for a clearer
statement, followed by an overview of the design:

*** WARNING *** The following text has extremely long class names.


/**
 * &lt;P&gt;Manages all hardware managers for a particular bus.  Each
 * HardwareRequest is assumed to be sent for a particular
 * HardwareResourceManager, so that a request
 * does not mix different kinds of resources together.  This may be changed
later
 * on if a need (or want) arises, but for now it is the easiest way to do
things.
 *
 * @author    Matt Albrecht
 * @version   1.0
 */
public class PrimaryHardwareManager extends HardwareResourceManager;

/**
 * &lt;P&gt;Allocates and deallocates hardware resources for a specific type of
 * resource.  Checks if the resource allocation requests request already
allocated
 *  resources :-)   (it's a pseudo-palendrome)
 *
 * &lt;P&gt;A unique &quot;type&quot; name needs to created, under the name _typeName:
 * &lt;PRE&gt;
 *       public final static String _typeName = &quot;MyUniqueTypeName&quot;
 * &lt;/PRE&gt;
 * Usually, this is the same as the class name.
 *
 * @author    Matt Albrecht
 * @version   1.0
 */
public abstract class HardwareResourceManager;


In this model, a &quot;HardwareResourceRequest&quot; is sent to the
PrimaryHardwareResourceManager (to which every known specific
HardwareResourceManager has registered itself with, or more accurately, the
PrimaryHardwareResourceManager has registered all known
HardwareResourceManagers to itself).  A request consists of a set of
&quot;HardwareResourceSetting&quot;s dedicated for a specific HardwareResourceManager
(like IOAddressHardwareResourceSetting is intended for
IOAddressHardwareResourceManager).  The PrimaryHardwareResourceManager
routes the request to the specific HardwareResourceManager, which analyzes
the request, and allocates the best fit HardwareResourceSetting (if there is
one), and creates a HardwareResourceInterface based on that setting for the
Driver to use.  This interface has the native code ties.

Is it any wonder no one volunteered to use it?

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;maybe a driver should plug into a device (setDriver(Driver d)) or can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;there be more than one driver at a time?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was pondering the other direction: MyDriver.setDevice( Device d ) so
</I>that
&gt;&gt;<i> multiple drivers can use a single device.  Here's where Device.veto()
</I>would
&gt;&gt;<i> come in handy, to prevent its use.  This would allow real-time upgrades
</I>to a
&gt;&gt;<i> better Driver.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;snip Driver.java&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;the same goes for this with the getDescription() and all...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> getDescription would be a human-readable string to indicate the operation
</I>of
&gt;&gt;<i> the Driver.  We could use this method as well in the Device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>you should have a getDescription() and a getHRName(), if you make a tree
</I>&gt;<i>of all of them you need getHRName for the name on the tree node, PNP6000
</I>&gt;<i>(or whatever) will hardly make sense to the average person.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>or better yet getName() is the HR one and you have a
</I>&gt;<i>get[Device|Driver]Name() for the ID
</I>
Great.  After typing those enormous class names above, I'll believe
anything.  But really, that sounds like the way to go.

&gt;<i>this is one of the things I love about Java, I am absolutely clueless
</I>&gt;<i>when it comes to devices and their drivers but I can still help out
</I>
Hey, this is a better kibitz turnout than when I first coded the beast.
Keep up the flames!
