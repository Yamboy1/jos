I know what you mean...
 
&gt;<i> &gt; an Object can be Scriptable if it has a ScriptInfo getScriptInfo(), but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what goes in ScriptInfo? (I'd just use BeanInfo but its to different)
</I>&gt;<i>         If I'm scripting an object, I'm either writing intra-program
</I>&gt;<i> (IRC scripts) or inter-program (shell scripts).  Typically, intra-program
</I>&gt;<i> scripts are event-fired (in the form of well-defined &quot;callbacks&quot; to the
</I>&gt;<i> scripts), and inter-program scripts are more like standard sequential
</I>&gt;<i> programming, thought there are plenty of exceptions.  Since we can embed
</I>&gt;<i> sequential programs in event-fired ones, event-fired scripts should be the
</I>&gt;<i> norm.  Therefore, getScriptInfo() should return the events that the
</I>&gt;<i> Scriptable Object will generate.
</I>
what if we want to make our java object an element in the script though?
like an add-on library, say we have a LuaMathLib object that has X math
methods that we want to map into the Lua interpreter as X fucntions...
how would we handle that? 
 
&gt;<i> &gt; we have Script, how do we allow interaction generically? and its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; top-level inner class Element, we have an element what do we do with it?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (goes with genric interaction above)
</I>&gt;<i>         I'd imagine the non-script-interperting classes can safely ignore
</I>&gt;<i> (or should be able to safely ignore) the components of a script.  As for
</I>&gt;<i> generic interactions, as above, I'd suggest that the code simply fire
</I>&gt;<i> events to a ScriptCollection, which would in turn handle distributing thos
</I>&gt;<i> events to the proper Scripts for handling; last (or first), it could
</I>&gt;<i> return that event to the program, so a default behavior could be included.
</I>&gt;<i> In the shell-script case, the only event would be script_begin (or
</I>&gt;<i> whatever).
</I>
my purpose in defining the Element top-level class was to allow a java
program to use parts of the script; say we have a reinit() function in
our script that we need to call... we get the Element for it to use
it... but what does Element look like?
 
&gt;<i> &gt; ScriptLoader is asked to load a script, it finds the appropriate child
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (ie LuaScriptLoader for a lua script) and calls load (returning a Script
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; object cast up from, using my previous example, a LuaScript). Gilbert,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how could your SmartFactory be used here?
</I>&gt;<i>         Wouldn't ScriptLoader /be/ a SmartFactory?
</I>
this is what I was thinking, but I havent --admittedtly-- looked the
SmartAPI over with what one would call a fine-toothed comb...
 
&gt;<i> &gt; Our program now has a Script, to run it calls execute(). is there a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; better way? how does it interact with the script when its executing?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what happens when its done? if we call execute() again what happens,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what should?
</I>&gt;<i>         See above -- execute() is a bad idea, for the problems you've
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned.  Interacting with the script would be responding to events it
</I>&gt;<i> generates, as moderated by the ScriptCollection (or whatever) and/or the
</I>&gt;<i> scripts themselves.  If you fire off two script_begin events, the behavior
</I>&gt;<i> should be the scripts choice: it can ignore it, spawn a new thread, queue
</I>&gt;<i> it up, etc...
</I>
if its left up to the script we should have a way to tell what its
action is going to be...

ok, when does the interpreter start and when does the script start? if
we have BOB (which is a C/C++ish type script) which has a main like C,
does the interpreter start the script when its loaded by calling main,
or does it wait until we tell it to start? what if its a library you
created to make programming your app easier and doesnt have a main as
its just a collection of functions... does it return a
NotARunnableScriptEvent?
 
&gt;<i> &gt; what if we have two seperate implementations from different authours,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how do we determine which to use?
</I>&gt;<i>         The SmartRegistry?  I think we can safely punt on this one for
</I>&gt;<i> now, because it's more a UI decision than an archictecture choice.
</I>
I guess...
 
&gt;<i> &gt; how do we tell what type of script a file is? MIME? attributes builtin
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the fs? a per directtoy DB containg info the files (I like it,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cross-fs. doesnt Jigsaw do this?)?
</I>&gt;<i>         Again, I'm tempted to punt on the problem for now.  I think
</I>&gt;<i> whatever method is chosen could be safely enscapulated accross fs's --
</I>&gt;<i> those don't have per-file attributes of the necessary kind get
</I>&gt;<i> per-directory DBs or MIME or a central registry, depending.
</I>
Id like a nice standard, fs-independent way; like the perdirectory
miniDB's since it can be copied across fs without alot of hassle... (and
hassle is one thing you dont want in coding or using an OS)
 
&gt;<i> &gt; in langauges already written-for/ported-to Java work? are there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; languages you can think of that wouldnt work in this GSI?
</I>&gt;<i>         JaCL (tcl interperter in java) is the one I'm most familiar with,
</I>&gt;<i> and it's not as nearly advanced as what I'm proposing here.  (BTW: the
</I>&gt;<i> event-based system would be translated by the respective Script objects to
</I>&gt;<i> whatever is most appropriate to the source language; shell script, for
</I>&gt;<i> instance, would get signals instead of events (which means most events
</I>&gt;<i> would be ignored), or (possibly) only if the event name matched a method
</I>&gt;<i> name, etc...
</I>
yea, we need it to be: stable, generic and simple (as possible);
otherwise theres no point in bothering with it...

Cheers,

	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
