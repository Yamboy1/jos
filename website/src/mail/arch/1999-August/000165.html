Good programs may use delegation and inheritence. Great programs use
delegation when delegation is needed and use inheritence when inheritence
is needed.

I agree with you about delegation. Many classes can't extend the
Application class. Delegation is better. I think the ProgramContext could
be passed to all kinds of reusable tools. Maybe a ArgumentParser tool could
accept a ProgramContext as a parameter. It goes off and parses parameters
in the style of UNIX(tm). So the code for parameter parsing doesn't have to
be written into every program.

&gt;<i>but I accept that other people have their own preference.
</I>
I strongly agree. I'm working on JOS because many operating systems have a
foundation of one-size-fits-all; those other vendors don't believe in your
preference. I'm working on the JOS registry so that it's easy to build
preferences into every JOS program.

I prefer to build my own operating system because Sun's JavaOS is not even
close to what I want. Neither is Microsoft Windows or Linux. I would prefer
to work with something more object oriented, something more reusable,
something more compatible.

JOS is state of the art. An operating system that benefits from all 50
years of the software industry's experience.

&gt;<i>I would think that the vast majority of programmers will
</I>&gt;<i>stick to the program interface that Sun designed rather than use an
</I>&gt;<i>interface that someone else wrote.
</I>
You're doing something different. You're working on the JOS Project, aren't
you? You're trying to imagine new possibilites. So, it's unconventional.
That doesn't bother you.

You have identified the biggest challenge facing the JOS project. Many Java
programmers prefer to follow Sun wherever they go.

- Are they going to stick to the one-process-per-JVM architecture that Sun
designed? How do we convince them they need a multiple process JOS JVM?

- Are they going to stick to depretiation, reasonable incompatibility,
feature-rich defective code and always-the-latest-platform loyalty that Sun
recommends? How do we convince them to give open source JOS APIs a try?

So, you think my design stinks? How do I fix it? You think it's a lost
cause? That's acceptable, too.

&gt;<i>I'm still not sure about the purpose
</I>&gt;<i>of Gilbert's unified program interface but whatever the purpose, it
</I>&gt;<i>would be (IMHO) best to achieve that purpose without making programs
</I>&gt;<i>implement a non-standard interface.
</I>
I am an architect and software critic. I experiment with these things.
That's what I do. I'm not asking every Java programmer to implement the
Program interface. I am not making the Program interface a requirement, but
maybe a viable option. I am trying to design an interface for JOS programs.

I wish there was some way to describe all that I am working on. I am
working on something big, really big. It is different than any other
software I have ever seen. It is the kind of operating system that I've
been looking for since 1985. It supports a model of one console/many
processors. It is a platform for a mid-level fourth generation language. It
is made possible by Java, thanks to Sun Microsystems.
