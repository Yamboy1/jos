I do not believe a program is an object. A program is a collection of
objects that are asked to perform a task or procedure. In an
object-oriented world, it is the objects in the program that are
reusable. Reuse at the Program interface level is how things work in the
&quot;procedural&quot; world.

This is why my main() methods do very little except pass control off to
&quot;reusable&quot; (in the OO sense) objects. The main() method (or procedure)
is useful in a procedural programming context, such as shell scripts.

A scripting language that is designed around object-oriented concepts
would not make use of the main() interface. Instead it would talk
directly with reusable objects. This is my vision of reusable JavaBeans
interacting with eachother rather than programs calling eachother in a
procedural way. I briefly outlined this vision in another email.
