<PRE>Hi ,

Thomas, It should be better to keep discuission in Arch. :p


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I found the problem with the vga registers. It was a bug in the in8 (in32)
</I>&gt;<i> method. I fixed it, and now the vga driver works. 640x480x16 (YES!!).
</I>
:<i>o, GREAT! It is enough. Since All VGA Card supports this mode!
</I>(If user is using EGA/CGA/HGA, we can't help............:p)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now we should start with a generic device loader (what do you think,
</I>&gt;<i> Hilary? The shark examples are quite good). I'm also very interested in
</I>&gt;<i> writing an IDE driver.
</I>
IMO, Shark provide a Generic Graphical Interface for drawing. We should
think about making a Generic Device Loader and then we make a Generic
Graphics Adaptor Driver.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> well, I've made some modifications in the source code, but I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> how to upload these changes. Can anybody help me?
</I>
I think we should use CVS. But I donno how to operate the CVS and we got
no right to access current JJOS CVS.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> another speed question: write8 is much faster than write 32 why? I wanted
</I>&gt;<i> to scrub the vga memory with write32, but it was too slow.
</I>
Would u mind pack several files to me that allows me to turn JOS to VGA Mode ?

Also, I found a Pascal Program that contains lots of SVGA Information using
VGA
Register. It called &quot;WhatVGA&quot;. It contains lots of drivers. I think it can
cover more
than 50% of current Adaptor. We can get those information and make the drivers

for the users.

Regards,

Hilary
