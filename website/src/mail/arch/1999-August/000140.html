The Mouse device will be setup to have an IRQ callback.  This is a type of
event.  So why not let the mouse device translate this event into a mouse
event, and fire it to the registered Drivers? (That's a retorical question -
I'll try to answer it below)

Using your method above, a mouse device would need to set the event, then
notify() all waiting drivers.  This is friendly for multi-threaded
applications, where the drivers can execute their mouse event in their own
thread.  I don't know if you remember the discussion on the Kernel list when
we were trying to figure out how to handle Interrupts.  Originally, IRQ
listeners would do a:
       synchronized( interrupt12 ) {
          interrupt12.wait();
       }
And they would wake up when the interrupt occured.  The problem was that
(with the keyboard), this routine quickly encountered a deadlock.

The alternate method is to have the &quot;wait queue&quot;, which is a event queue
where the queue performs a wait if it is empty on a request to retrieve the
next element.  This is probably the way to go in a device/driver interface.
The wait queue would be a shared object between the device and the driver.
The device would need to keep one queue per registered driver, if multiple
driver registration is supported.

&gt;&gt;<i> hasDriver() *may* be appropriate for many devices (like HardDrive

&gt;&gt;<i> wouldn't like multiple drivers, unaware of each other, messing around at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> low-level at the same time, but I don't care how many drivers listen to
</I>the
&gt;&gt;<i> MouseDevice).  isLoaded(), I feel, may be a reiterative method: if the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Driver can find the device, it has been loaded.  Or maybe I'm not seeing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something with this.  I dunno.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>hasDriver could throw OperationUnsupportedException or it could be in a
</I>&gt;<i>UniDriver interface (horrid name, but you get the idea).
</I>
I'm crossed on this.  If we could implement both at the same time, I'd be
happy 8-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>couldnt isLoaded() be for a device like a zip drive that you can plug
</I>&gt;<i>and unplug at runtime, for speed the user sets it up to always have the
</I>&gt;<i>device loaded (since he only takes it off to transfer data on a friends
</I>&gt;<i>computer, for an example)
</I>
Hot-swappable devices?  I thought that JavaOS did a good job with this.
When a device was disconnected, it sent an event to all listening drivers to
say, &quot;Hey, I'm gone.  You're on your own.&quot;  The drivers then figure out how
to handle this problem.

In this way, devices are not in the system for registration purposes.  There
is a problem with this in the way of Java's garbage collection, but, again,
JavaOS handled it well.  I won't go into detail how they did it, unless you
*really* want me to.

&gt;&gt;<i> In this model, a &quot;HardwareResourceRequest&quot; is sent to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PrimaryHardwareResourceManager (to which every known specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HardwareResourceManager has registered itself with, or more accurately,
</I>the
&gt;&gt;<i> PrimaryHardwareResourceManager has registered all known
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HardwareResourceManagers to itself).  A request consists of a set of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;HardwareResourceSetting&quot;s dedicated for a specific
</I>HardwareResourceManager
&gt;&gt;<i> (like IOAddressHardwareResourceSetting is intended for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IOAddressHardwareResourceManager).  The PrimaryHardwareResourceManager
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> routes the request to the specific HardwareResourceManager, which
</I>analyzes
&gt;&gt;<i> the request, and allocates the best fit HardwareResourceSetting (if there
</I>is
&gt;&gt;<i> one), and creates a HardwareResourceInterface based on that setting for
</I>the
&gt;&gt;<i> Driver to use.  This interface has the native code ties.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is it any wonder no one volunteered to use it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think my brain melted, jeez
</I>
Exactly.  But I haven't been able to come up with a simpler example, besides
letting the driver send a series of requests to the manager until a hardware
configuration turns up good.  That may be the way to go.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;you should have a getDescription() and a getHRName(), if you make a tree
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;of all of them you need getHRName for the name on the tree node, PNP6000
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;(or whatever) will hardly make sense to the average person.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;or better yet getName() is the HR one and you have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;get[Device|Driver]Name() for the ID
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Great.  After typing those enormous class names above, I'll believe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything.  But really, that sounds like the way to go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>be easier for creating a visual device tree at the very least...
</I>
Sounds useful.  Let's do it.
