exactly.
 
&gt;<i> I agree with you about delegation. Many classes can't extend the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;but I accept that other people have their own preference.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I strongly agree. I'm working on JOS because many operating systems have a
</I>&gt;<i> foundation of one-size-fits-all; those other vendors don't believe in your
</I>&gt;<i> preference. I'm working on the JOS registry so that it's easy to build
</I>&gt;<i> preferences into every JOS program.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I prefer to build my own operating system because Sun's JavaOS is not even
</I>&gt;<i> close to what I want. Neither is Microsoft Windows or Linux. I would prefer
</I>&gt;<i> to work with something more object oriented, something more reusable,
</I>&gt;<i> something more compatible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> JOS is state of the art. An operating system that benefits from all 50
</I>&gt;<i> years of the software industry's experience.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I would think that the vast majority of programmers will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;stick to the program interface that Sun designed rather than use an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;interface that someone else wrote.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're doing something different. You're working on the JOS Project, aren't
</I>&gt;<i> you? You're trying to imagine new possibilites. So, it's unconventional.
</I>&gt;<i> That doesn't bother you.
</I>
unconventional doesnt bother me per se, incompatable does.
 
&gt;<i> You have identified the biggest challenge facing the JOS project. Many Java
</I>&gt;<i> programmers prefer to follow Sun wherever they go.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Are they going to stick to the one-process-per-JVM architecture that Sun
</I>&gt;<i> designed? How do we convince them they need a multiple process JOS JVM?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Are they going to stick to depretiation, reasonable incompatibility,
</I>&gt;<i> feature-rich defective code and always-the-latest-platform loyalty that Sun
</I>&gt;<i> recommends? How do we convince them to give open source JOS APIs a try?
</I>
I hate to be a bitch about this (but half of my family were english
teachers) its *deprecation*, depreciation is similar but not even based
on the same root... convergent evolution and all... anyway...

we convince them by making the best damn apps around and get everyone to
use them (big buisness, not-so-big buisness, and everyone with a PC)
 
&gt;<i> So, you think my design stinks? How do I fix it? You think it's a lost
</I>&gt;<i> cause? That's acceptable, too.
</I>
one of my favorite quotes (even if its actually my
paraphrase/generlization of it) is: &quot;I could be wrong, but it would
still be progress&quot;.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;I'm still not sure about the purpose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;of Gilbert's unified program interface but whatever the purpose, it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;would be (IMHO) best to achieve that purpose without making programs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;implement a non-standard interface.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am an architect and software critic. I experiment with these things.
</I>&gt;<i> That's what I do. I'm not asking every Java programmer to implement the
</I>&gt;<i> Program interface. I am not making the Program interface a requirement, but
</I>&gt;<i> maybe a viable option. I am trying to design an interface for JOS programs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wish there was some way to describe all that I am working on. I am
</I>&gt;<i> working on something big, really big. It is different than any other
</I>&gt;<i> software I have ever seen. It is the kind of operating system that I've
</I>&gt;<i> been looking for since 1985. It supports a model of one console/many
</I>&gt;<i> processors. It is a platform for a mid-level fourth generation language. It
</I>&gt;<i> is made possible by Java, thanks to Sun Microsystems.
</I>
I like 3GL's myself, but what can I say Im a sentimentalist... I think
you should stress Program as an option though, that seems to be the root
of the confusion

Cheers,
DigiGod

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
