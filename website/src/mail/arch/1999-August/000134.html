&quot;If you get it right the first time, you probably dont know what your
doing&quot; --I try to keep that one close to heart as they say
 
&gt;<i> This was meant to separate the discovery/setup functionality from the
</I>&gt;<i> operational use.  Also, it enables the Device to store its state in a device
</I>&gt;<i> registry for easy recovery.  So, to answer your question: the ScannerDevice
</I>&gt;<i> would need a ScannerUSBDevice, ScannerSCSIDevice, ScannerParallelDevice, and
</I>&gt;<i> so on.  Each of these devices would subclass from the USBDevice, SCSIDevice,
</I>&gt;<i> &amp;c, and implement the ScannerDeviceInterface (or possibly the other way
</I>&gt;<i> around - SCSIDevice is an interface, and ScannerDevice is a class.  I
</I>&gt;<i> haven't played around with this, so we'll have to see what works best).
</I>
my experience would say that having SCSIDevice and the lot as interfaces
would save the most code/space/time/soda. and from an OO perspective it
makes the most sense (it IS-A ScannerDevice and it IS-A SCSIDevice in
this scenario, otherwise it would just be a SCSIDevice)
 
&gt;<i> When I wrote the KeyboardDevice, it had the discovery/setup code, as well as
</I>&gt;<i> the very basic methods to get scancodes from the device.  The KeyboardDriver
</I>&gt;<i> translated these scancodes into usable data.  So we could have a
</I>&gt;<i> ISAKeyboardDevice, linked to a ISAKeyboardTranslator (which translates
</I>&gt;<i> scancodes into VA_? keycodes; this is a &quot;pass-through&quot; driver), which is
</I>&gt;<i> linked to KeyboardPressedSet (monitors the press/release state of each VA_?
</I>&gt;<i> key) and USAKeyboardDriver (which translates the VA_? push/release keycodes
</I>&gt;<i> into uppercase, lowercase, special shift combinations, and num-pad character
</I>&gt;<i> creation).
</I>
brilliant, brilliant; yes, I understand now
 
&gt;<i> So I guess we can look at a Device simplisticly as a standard I/O Device
</I>&gt;<i> which inputs a byte stream, and outputs a byte stream.  Of course,
</I>&gt;<i> specialized subclasses (like the KeyboardDevice, with its specialized
</I>&gt;<i> implementations) do a tad bit more than that.  Or maybe we could look at a
</I>&gt;<i> Device as either a stream device (like a hard drive), or as an event device
</I>&gt;<i> (like a keyboard or mouse), or as both (like a modem or ethernet card).
</I>
my only xprnc with device drivers is MS-DOS (and an article I read on
OS/2 dd's but I dont remember any of it), there you either have a
charecter device (a kbd) or a block device (a serial port). In Java both
would be streams, I think we should do that, leave it to the driver to
generate the events.

&gt;<i> &gt;whats the PrimaryHardwareManager (and why's it primary? shouldnt it be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;static HardwareManager PrimaryHardwareManager; in the HM class? with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;getPrimaryHardwareManager()?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ah.  That was a beast unto itself.  That was my cut at handling platform
</I>&gt;<i> resources (like I/O Addresses, Memory, DMA, interrupts, and so on).  The
</I>&gt;<i> primary hardware manager handled routing the resource request to the
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate manager.  It was interesting in that it handled plug-n-play
</I>&gt;<i> well, where a device may request the best fit for a set of resources (for
</I>&gt;<i> instance, a Sound Blaster Pro needs one of IRQ 2, 5, 7, or 10).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't use a static primary hardware manager, because I have a natural
</I>&gt;<i> aversion to using static data.  It leads to nasty situations where one
</I>&gt;<i> thread may need one kind of a class, and another thread needs a slightly
</I>&gt;<i> different class, or someone decides to use a different implementation in the
</I>&gt;<i> middle of runtime.  I was *especially* weary of this with a system level
</I>&gt;<i> variable.
</I>
understandable, if not slightly confusing...

I cant think of how to word what I want to say so Im going to give you
this awkardly abbriviated class instead:

public class HardwareManager {
 private static HardwareManager primary;

 static {
  primary = createHardwareManager();
 }
 
 public static HardwareManager getPrimaryHardwareManager() {
  return primary;
 }

 public static HardwareManager createHardwareManager() {
  return new HardwareManager();
 }

 public static void setPrimaryHardwareManager(HardwareManager hm) {
  if(hm==null)
   return;
  synchronized(primary) {
   primary = hm;
  }
 }

 private HardwareManager() {
  super();
 }
}

I dont know if thats what you mean in the way I think or not. agh, I
dont know what I just said
 
&gt;<i> &gt;is name its device name? or its HRF name? (getHRName() also if its the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;former), how about a getDescription() so a DeviceManager (config app)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;can give some info.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Name for the Device would be the unique name for the device, such as PNP0600
</I>&gt;<i> (Generic ESDI/IDE/ATA hard disk controller), PNP0102 (MCA timers), and so
</I>&gt;<i> on.
</I>
so getName() is for the computer
 
&gt;<i> &gt;what about some state info, like isLoaded(), isActive() or hasDriver()?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure.  This was my first cut, where I wanted to leave it as open as
</I>&gt;<i> possible.  I would say isLoaded() is the only one really necessary.
</I>
agreed
 
&gt;<i> &gt;maybe a driver should plug into a device (setDriver(Driver d)) or can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;there be more than one driver at a time?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was pondering the other direction: MyDriver.setDevice( Device d ) so that
</I>&gt;<i> multiple drivers can use a single device.  Here's where Device.veto() would
</I>&gt;<i> come in handy, to prevent its use.  This would allow real-time upgrades to a
</I>&gt;<i> better Driver.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip Driver.java&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the same goes for this with the getDescription() and all...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> getDescription would be a human-readable string to indicate the operation of
</I>&gt;<i> the Driver.  We could use this method as well in the Device.
</I>
you should have a getDescription() and a getHRName(), if you make a tree
of all of them you need getHRName for the name on the tree node, PNP6000
(or whatever) will hardly make sense to the average person.

or better yet getName() is the HR one and you have a
get[Device|Driver]Name() for the ID
 
&gt;<i> &gt;speaking of descriptions, whats this a driver for? how about: Device
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;getDevice()?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;some state info for this would be good too, like hasControlOfDevice()
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good points.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;You should also have an abstract DeviceAdaptor and DriverAdaptor for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;faster impl.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You mean like java.awt.WindowAdapter which is a concrete class
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of java.awt.WindowListener?  Good idea.
</I>
exactly.

this is one of the things I love about Java, I am absolutely clueless
when it comes to devices and their drivers but I can still help out

Cheers,
