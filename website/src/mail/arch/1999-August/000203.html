<PRE>&gt;<i> we have the ScriptLoader thats like a ClassLoader for scripts, should we
</I>&gt;<i> have a SCRIPTPATH?
</I>
	If necessary.  I can't shake the feeling that There Ought To Be A
Better Way, though.

&gt;<i> an Object can be Scriptable if it has a ScriptInfo getScriptInfo(), but
</I>&gt;<i> what goes in ScriptInfo? (I'd just use BeanInfo but its to different)
</I>
	If I'm scripting an object, I'm either writing intra-program
(IRC scripts) or inter-program (shell scripts).	 Typically, intra-program
scripts are event-fired (in the form of well-defined &quot;callbacks&quot; to the
scripts), and inter-program scripts are more like standard sequential
programming, thought there are plenty of exceptions.  Since we can embed
sequential programs in event-fired ones, event-fired scripts should be the
norm.  Therefore, getScriptInfo() should return the events that the
Scriptable Object will generate.

&gt;<i> we have Script, how do we allow interaction generically? and its
</I>&gt;<i> top-level inner class Element, we have an element what do we do with it?
</I>&gt;<i> (goes with genric interaction above)
</I>
	I'd imagine the non-script-interperting classes can safely ignore
(or should be able to safely ignore) the components of a script.  As for
generic interactions, as above, I'd suggest that the code simply fire
events to a ScriptCollection, which would in turn handle distributing thos
events to the proper Scripts for handling; last (or first), it could
return that event to the program, so a default behavior could be included.
In the shell-script case, the only event would be script_begin (or
whatever).

&gt;<i> ScriptLoader is asked to load a script, it finds the appropriate child
</I>&gt;<i> (ie LuaScriptLoader for a lua script) and calls load (returning a Script
</I>&gt;<i> object cast up from, using my previous example, a LuaScript). Gilbert,
</I>&gt;<i> how could your SmartFactory be used here?
</I>
	Wouldn't ScriptLoader /be/ a SmartFactory?

&gt;<i> Our program now has a Script, to run it calls execute(). is there a
</I>&gt;<i> better way? how does it interact with the script when its executing?
</I>&gt;<i> what happens when its done? if we call execute() again what happens,
</I>&gt;<i> what should?
</I>
	See above -- execute() is a bad idea, for the problems you've
mentioned.  Interacting with the script would be responding to events it
generates, as moderated by the ScriptCollection (or whatever) and/or the
scripts themselves.  If you fire off two script_begin events, the behavior
should be the scripts choice: it can ignore it, spawn a new thread, queue
it up, etc...

&gt;<i> what if we have two seperate implementations from different authours,
</I>&gt;<i> how do we determine which to use? 
</I>
	The SmartRegistry?  I think we can safely punt on this one for
now, because it's more a UI decision than an archictecture choice.

&gt;<i> how do we tell what type of script a file is? MIME? attributes builtin
</I>&gt;<i> to the fs? a per directtoy DB containg info the files (I like it,
</I>&gt;<i> cross-fs. doesnt Jigsaw do this?)?
</I>
	Again, I'm tempted to punt on the problem for now.  I think
whatever method is chosen could be safely enscapulated accross fs's --
those don't have per-file attributes of the necessary kind get
per-directory DBs or MIME or a central registry, depending.

&gt;<i> in langauges already written-for/ported-to Java work? are there
</I>&gt;<i> languages you can think of that wouldnt work in this GSI?
</I>
	JaCL (tcl interperter in java) is the one I'm most familiar with,
and it's not as nearly advanced as what I'm proposing here.  (BTW: the
event-based system would be translated by the respective Script objects to
whatever is most appropriate to the source language; shell script, for
instance, would get signals instead of events (which means most events
would be ignored), or (possibly) only if the event name matched a method
name, etc...
