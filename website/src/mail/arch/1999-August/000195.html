<PRE>&gt;<i> What is our approach to solving the unsolvable?
</I>
	Unsolvable?  I believe the design for a multi-process JVM that
I've been presenting on this and the kernel list is a solution.  The
solution to seperate processes is quite simply separate namespaces, which
are easy to establish if you control the primordial namespace.  Because
Java has no pointers, disjoint namespaces are protected from each other in
the exact same fashion in which multiple native processes are protected by
the PMMU.  The exact mechanics of IPC and the various methods for
obtaining space efficiency will be left almost entirely to Java code, and
will evolve over time.

	My goal in the design of this system is transperancy.  Any extant
spec-compliant code must run unmodified on decaf, and behave in the
expected manner.  This will entail modifications to certain library
classes, which also must be transparent to the caller.

	I understand your desire to start programming right away.  And it
looks like your Program proposal will indeed allow you to fake multiple
processes on a single process JVM.  If that's the case, it will certainly
work on decaf, and you can re-write the back-end to actually make the
Programs separate processes.  However, I question your diagnostic of
processes as being symptomatic of distrust.  Processes, aside from being a
wonderful programming convenience, are a way of moving the problem of
fallibility from many places (all of your programs) to one (the process
manager), which is a good thing for obvious reasons.
