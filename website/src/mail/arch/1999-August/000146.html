</I>&gt;<i> An &quot;Java application&quot; is a kind-of program. It is defined as any class with

</I>&gt;<i> program is not always an &quot;application&quot;. An application is a self-contained,
</I>&gt;<i> independent program. A result code is irrelevant for an &quot;application&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> because it is never expected to &quot;fail&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While the &quot;Java applet&quot; is a strong model for a program, an &quot;application&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> is not. What is wrong with static main()? Since a static method cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> inherited, an application cannot inherit the main() behavior of its
</I>&gt;<i> superclass.
</I>
static methods are inherited, to test it I made these three files:
/////
public class test1 {
 public static void main(String args[]) {
  System.out.println(&quot;one&quot;);
 }
}
/////
/////
public class test2 extends test1 {
 public static void main(String args[]) {
  test1.main(args);         // this is the only way to access a
superclasses static methods in another static method...
  System.out.println(&quot;two&quot;);
 }
}
/////
/////
public class test3 extends test1 {
}
/////

if you run these...
test 1 outputs:
one
test 2 outputs:
one
two
test 3 outputs:
one

which means test2 accesed its superclasses main() method (although not
in the best way)

and test3 inherited its main method and didnt need one of its own
 
&gt;<i> Also, the static main() is declared as void. When one application launches
</I>&gt;<i> another, a result code is not expected or desired. That's the nature of
</I>&gt;<i> applications.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, a result code is critical when a program runs a
</I>&gt;<i> sub-program. It is the nature of programs. If applications are used where
</I>&gt;<i> programs are required, there is no result code.
</I>
thats what exit(int) is for
 
&gt;<i> &gt;Now, my program (with it's main method n'all), can:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;1. get parameters from the argument list of the main() method.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;2. get environment parameters from System.getProperties()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;3. exit with a result code using System.exit(code)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, Java provides the perfect environment for applications. The
</I>&gt;<i> application context is java.lang.System and java.lang.Runtime. An
</I>&gt;<i> application is all alone inside a JVM, and should be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a hostile environment for programs. Each program must have its own
</I>&gt;<i> unique context. Programs cannot share java.lang.System and
</I>&gt;<i> java.lang.Runtime because each program has its own unique set of
</I>&gt;<i> parameters. Each has its own unique result code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This model enables a program to use another program within a single JVM,
</I>&gt;<i> without resorting to the Runtime/Process model. We retain the benefit of
</I>&gt;<i> knowing when a program's result code.
</I>
arguably, you could do this currently if you dont mind creating another
JVM
 
&gt;<i> Since applications, applets, servlets and aglets are different kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;programs&quot;, it becomes possible to unify all programs under a program API.
</I>&gt;<i> A program browser would provide a host environment for running (and
</I>&gt;<i> debugging!) all kinds of programs.
</I>
this would only be internal, right? I mean you have the program
interface then you have an ApplicationProgram that runs a java app as a
program or a ServletProgram, so that all programs can be handled the
same way internally; and still allow for the prospect of someone making
his app a program or use programs as plugins or whatever...
 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; A program is not a process. It does not have its own System.in, System.out,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and System.err. It is a well-defined interface.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Ok, I think this suggests (a lot of guess work here) that the use of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;this Program interface is where a program wants to interact with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;number of other programs to achieve a goal, all in a single process
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(optional).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Traditional runtime code reuse has always started with the program model.
</I>&gt;<i> You can build many little programs, like UNIX(tm) and all other operating
</I>&gt;<i> systems, an combine them with scripts (and batch files). Since JOS needs a
</I>&gt;<i> program model and Java API doesn't have one, we thought we'd create it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be a bad thing if your shell launches a sub-program that calls
</I>&gt;<i> System.exit() with a result code. Your shell would end prematurely.
</I>
The Security manager would deny that request in a properly designed
shell, or it would simply run the app in its own process
 
&gt;<i> The make tool demonstrates the need for a program model. The make tool's
</I>&gt;<i> purpose is to run sub-programs based on simple rules. It is critical to the
</I>&gt;<i> make tool to &quot;know&quot; when a sub-program failed. When a sub-program fails,
</I>&gt;<i> the whole make fails.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be a bad thing if the make tool launches a sub-program that calls
</I>&gt;<i> System.exit() with a result code. A make script would end prematurely.
</I>
again, security manager...
 
&gt;<i> It would be a bad thing for your servlet to call System.exit() with a
</I>&gt;<i> result code. It would end the servlet enviroment prematurely. Servlets are
</I>&gt;<i> expected to use an &quot;honor system&quot; among serlet programmers, instead of a
</I>&gt;<i> security system.
</I>
I was under the impression that servlets were sandboxed when it came to
stuff like that
 
&gt;<i> &gt;The concept of the main() method (and therefore, your Program interface
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;too) is very primitive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly. A minimal interface is our goal. We are trying to reduce a program
</I>&gt;<i> down to its barest essentials. We are not adding the complexity of multiple
</I>&gt;<i> threads or multiple independent processes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;If you would like to achieve a higher goal by linking together several
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;programs, the main/run() method is a very limiting solution to the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;UNIX is about as good as it gets (UNIX consists of lots of little programs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cooperating with each other by calling each other's main() methods. The shell
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;orchestrates this with pipes and redirection symbols.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> UNIX(tm) is as good as it gets. The reason it exists on UNIX(tm) is simply
</I>&gt;<i> because it is needed. The classic data processing model has been expanded
</I>&gt;<i> beyond UNIX(tm). It is available on every major operating system, except Java.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;With the advent of Java, piping and main() arguments seem unintuitive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sun Microsystems insists that an instance of the JVM must be created for
</I>&gt;<i> each application. The JVM still support piping and a result code on the
</I>&gt;<i> outside. The native OS can still redirect standard in, standard out and
</I>&gt;<i> standard err. The result code passed to System.exit() is returned to the
</I>&gt;<i> native OS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The benefit of the program model have not been passed on to your Java code.
</I>&gt;<i> It would be very difficult to get &quot;public static int main( String[] args )&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> to work anyway.
</I>
you could do:

public static void main(String args[]) {
 System.exit(intmain(args));
}

public static int intmain(String args[]) {
 //bla bla bla
 return 0;
}

but that just spells hack, on the other hand since static methods are
inherited you could put that main in a superclass and have its children
define an intmain() 

&gt;<i> &gt;Instead we could have JavaBeans interacting with each other.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure. I supposed you could have JavaBeans acting like programs without a
</I>&gt;<i> well-defined program interface. Each bean might have a different interface.
</I>&gt;<i> Parameters for a program could be thought of as properties of a bean. The
</I>&gt;<i> result code from a bean would be the return value of some method.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This program and program context model provides a way to use JavaBeans as
</I>&gt;<i> if they were programs. A well-defined interface is used instead of
</I>&gt;<i> reflection. And class, even a bean, can implement the program interface.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> More importantly, this gives us a unified model for JOS programs. When you
</I>&gt;<i> want to run a program from a shell, the shell can check for a program
</I>&gt;<i> interface. The shell can run many programs, properly, with result codes,
</I>&gt;<i> within a single JVM.
</I>
but it would support legacy by saying &quot;oh, this is an Applet that doesnt
implemtn Program, Ill use the AppletProgram class to proxy and load
it...&quot;
 
&gt;<i> Further, we bring back the power of shell scripting. When the shell runs a
</I>&gt;<i> shell script, it can return the result code of every program it runs. The
</I>&gt;<i> shell script can handle non-zero result codes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Plus, the shell can launch a program in a separate thread or a separate
</I>&gt;<i> process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Given JavaBeans and (standard) programs, do we really need a third
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;option?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have Java &quot;applications&quot;, &quot;applets&quot;, &quot;servlets&quot;, &quot;aglets&quot;, &quot;browslets&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;pluglets&quot; and &quot;jarlets&quot;. We have beans, too. All these things are
</I>&gt;<i> different kinds of programs. Instead of having a separate (incompatible)
</I>&gt;<i> interface for each speciality, there are benefits to bringing them together.
</I>
Im for this, although I think it needs some work.

on another semi-related note I have a handy way of making your &quot;main()&quot;
class a bit easier to read and program:
////
package digigod.apps;

import java.io.*;

public abstract class Application {
 private          String         arguments[];
 private          BufferedReader reader      = null;
 protected static Application    app         = null;

 public static void main(String args[]) {
  if(app==null)
   System.exit(255);
  app.parseArgs(args);
  app.exit(app.appMain());
 }

 public int getArgsLength() {
  return arguments.length;
 }

 public String getArg(int idx) {
  return arguments[idx];
 }

 public String[] getArgs() {
  return arguments;
 }
 
 public void exit() {
  exit(0);
 }

 public void exit(int code) {
  System.exit(code);
 }

 public void print(String str) {
  System.out.print(str);
 }

 public void println(String str) {
  System.out.println(str);
 }

 public void printerr(String str) {
  System.err.println(str);
 }

 public String readln() throws IOException {
  if(reader==null)
   reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
  return reader.readLine();
 }

 // only these methods below should be altered by a child, and only the
first required to be
 
 public abstract int appMain();

 public void parseArgs(String args[]) { //can be overridden to add extra
parsing functionality
  arguments = args;
 }
 
 public String getApplicationInfo() {
  return &quot;&quot;;
 } 
}
////

this is basically just a wrapper and doesnt have to be used, you can
make your hello world either way:

public class hello {
 public static void main(String args[]) {
  System.out.println(&quot;hello world&quot;);
 }
}

or

import digigod.apps.Application; //if this was in jos Id imagine it
would be in org.jos.apps

public class HelloHello extends Application {
 static {
  app = new HelloHello(); //somewhat hackish, but somehow more
explanatory...
 }

 public int appMain() {
  println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
 }
}

which is better? neither, they're both the same you'd run them the same
and use them the same; the only difference is a) your class now IS-An
Application and b) its easier to program since most of that crap is
taken care of.

if you want to use parameters it has some methods for getting them, and
if you want you can overide the default parseArgs() behavior to do the
parsing outside of the main method (for readability/seperation of use)
if you want you could build a HashSet (Hashtable for those who dont know
collections yet) of the parsed args so the app doesnt have to deal with
them in main at all.

I bring this up because they are related, look at the other class in the
digigod.apps package:
/////
package digigod.apps;

public abstract class JOSApplication extends Application {
 public static void main(String args[]) {
  if(System.getProperty(&quot;os.name&quot;).equals(&quot;JOS&quot;))
   System.out.println(&quot;Requires JOS (www.jos.org)&quot;);
  Application.main(args);
 }

 public abstract int appMain();
}
/////

this is for Applications that are dependednt on JOS, as you can see
theres nothing in it now... since nothing exists really... but it could
have stuff like acess to Process information, a GSI and a Registry
binding, but more on topic, it could implement program (using the
appMain in its run, mind you)

jeez, that was long. anyway, what do you think?

Cheers,
DigiGod
