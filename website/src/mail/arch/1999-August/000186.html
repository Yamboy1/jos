<PRE>Well, maybe we shouldn't have full bean support to begin with (you'll see
why below), but its an option for a &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; for a general
scripting support system.

I was more or less thinking of replacing the stdin/stdout/stderr piping with
the beans event handling.  Sure, we can have a generic &quot;StreamListener&quot; to
emulate standard Unix/DOS filters, but we can go beyond that.

Also, instead of having just a method in a bean to call (we can have that
too), an event driven system would allow for branching (calling one event
instead of another).  This may help reduce some of the syntax developed in
shells to get the same result.

So, instead of (using ksh):
(cc mycode.c -o mycode 2&gt; errlog) || (more errlog; rm errlog; exit)
echo &quot;Compiled Ok&quot;

which would output the compilation errors from the c compiler to errlog, and
on an error would display a paged version of the errors, remove that file,
then exit from the script.  If the compilation went ok, then the message is
displayed.

Instead, we could have (to use a made up language, which would/could
probably be done on a visual GUI):
let a = new ccBean()  // create a new bean interface to the compiler
let b = new pagedStreamBean() // create a new bean which pages the output of
its given stream, in the &quot;StreamListener&quot; event.
let c = new echoBean( &quot;Compiled Ok&quot; ) // echos &quot;Compiled Ok&quot; to the screen
on the event.
a.addErrorStreamListener( b ) // set b as the StreamListener for error text
a.addErrorListener( b ) // set b as the &quot;next event&quot; to be called when an
error happens
a.addSucceedListener( c ) // set c as the successful &quot;next event&quot; listener.
run a // or whatever we decide on to execute the bean

Ok, sure, I added a *ton* of typing to a simple command line, and I had to
really think about how to chain it together.  If I had to do this scripting
full time, I would need to know the methods of my beans before I script,
which would be like looking at the JDK documents all the time.  But then,
I've never typed bean-script before (I doubt that very many people have :),
and this is a off-the-top-of-my-head language.

So, maybe this isn't the way to go.  But perhaps we can generalize this so
that it can be a framework from which any scripting language is tied to.
Perhaps.  That's why this is still under Arch.
