As a rule, I try not to use reflection. Like delegation and inheritence,
reflection has its place. Interfaces are usually better than reflection.
Interfaces should used whenever you can find some kind of a pattern.

Patterns can be difficult to find. A problem &quot;solved&quot; by reflection may
indicate that a pattern hasn't been found yet. Reflection should be used
when there is no pattern. Unfortunately, many programmers use reflection
when they don't have time to look for a pattern.

Is there a pattern to parameters passed on a command line? I don't think
so. Then again, maybe I'm wrong. I might have been too quick to stop looking.

We also have to keep in mind that some JVMs have no support for reflection.
