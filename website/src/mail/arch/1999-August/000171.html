Yes! I want to &quot;run&quot; most of my programs both as a regular Java application
compatible with the java tool *and* from any other Java class. It should be
easy. It should be direct. It shouldn't take much.

Like you, I want to build an application most of the time by extending a
powerful base class. And yet, there are times when I need to run an
existing class as a program, too. Delegating the ProgramContext to a
separate object reduces the amount of new code I have to write in either case.

So far, this discussion has identified very important issues. I hope that
some really good code comes out of it. I would like to use an
implementation of ParameterParser (ArgumentParser) that parses parameters
from ProgramContext using the UNIX(tm) way. What would a ParameterParser
look like anyway?

A program should decide for itself if it needs the assistence a parameter
parser, and if so which one.

Isn't this cool? I should be able to have properties of my program set
automatically based on command line arguments. Could we do this?

public class DemoProgram {
:<i>
</I>  public void set__help( boolean v ) {
  }
:<i>
</I>}

so that when I use java org.jos.demo.DemoProgram --help, the set__help()
method is called automatically? We can do this once with a
UNIXStyleParameterParser. But wait! We can pass a Program to a
ParameterParser, not a ProgramContext. The parser needs both the program
and context, but getProgramContext() is part of the Program interface (or
should be).

If we substitute underscores (_) for dashes (-), the names of all command
line parameters are reflected in a program. If there's a command line
parameter that does not match a method of a program, should the parser
throw an exception?

My head hurts to think about this any more.
