</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, and this is why I cannot understand your goal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Applications, applets and servlets are each used in entirely different
</I>&gt;<i> situations, hence they have different interfaces that reflect how they
</I>&gt;<i> are used:
</I>
I agree
 
&gt;<i> - A servlet can only be run from within a servlet engine because it
</I>&gt;<i> relies on a very unique environment. For example, an HTTP servlet relies
</I>&gt;<i> on the fact that it can access various information in the HTTP header of
</I>&gt;<i> a request. It relies on the fact that its instance can persist between
</I>&gt;<i> invocations, so it can keep a database connection open (for example).
</I>&gt;<i> Both of these dependencies bar servlets from being invoked in a uniform
</I>&gt;<i> manner with other types of programs. For example, you just can't run a
</I>&gt;<i> servlet from the command-line. It doesn't make any sense.
</I>
it could be loaded in servletrunner
 
&gt;<i> - An applet is also very different from a command-line program. The key
</I>&gt;<i> quality of an Applet is that it is a part of a larger entity. It
</I>&gt;<i> requires this entity to be useful. An applet cannot be executed unless
</I>&gt;<i> it is in a web page. The applet is very aware that it is in a web page.
</I>&gt;<i> It can read its applet parameters which are defined in the web page, it
</I>&gt;<i> can communicate with other applets that are in the web page, it can even
</I>&gt;<i> make another web page load. Because of its different nature, it can't be
</I>&gt;<i> treated in a similar way to applications or servlets. Another point is
</I>&gt;<i> that you don't really invoke an applet (as you do with the programs you
</I>&gt;<i> speak of), you &quot;embed&quot; it in an application specific way that is
</I>&gt;<i> provided by the applet itself.
</I>
it could be loaded in appletviewer
 
&gt;<i> - Applications (both gui and command-line) are intended to be invoked.
</I>&gt;<i> Applications are a unique type of program that are designed to carry out
</I>&gt;<i> a task and return to the shell, or carry out tasks given through a user
</I>&gt;<i> interface until the user wishes to exit the application. These types of
</I>&gt;<i> programs are the only programs that are suitable for shells because they
</I>&gt;<i> can be invoked, they have a clearly defined lifespan, and a definite way
</I>&gt;<i> of returning to the shell.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A result code is irrelevant for an &quot;application&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because it is never expected to &quot;fail&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree. There is definately a distinction between applications and
</I>&gt;<i> command-line tools, even though Sun decided to invoke both types through
</I>&gt;<i> the same unified interface - the main() method. However, I think they
</I>&gt;<i> realised that the unification could not extend beyond applications and
</I>&gt;<i> command-line tools. So, applets and servlets are &quot;used&quot; through a
</I>&gt;<i> different interface that caters for their use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While the &quot;Java applet&quot; is a strong model for a program, an &quot;application&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is not. What is wrong with static main()? Since a static method cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inherited, an application cannot inherit the main() behavior of its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; superclass.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> main() typically does not have any behaviour to inherit. It should fire
</I>&gt;<i> up a reusable object and let it handle the rest of the processing. Any
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour you put in to main() is not reusable from an OO perspective so
</I>&gt;<i> it is wise to pass control into reusable objects as soon as possible.
</I>
yup, although my application class would allow you to inherit the main
method... (which I never thought about until now...)
 
&gt;<i> &gt; This model enables a program to use another program within a single JVM,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without resorting to the Runtime/Process model. We retain the benefit of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; knowing when a program's result code.
</I>&gt;<i> --snip--
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It would be a bad thing if your shell launches a sub-program that calls
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; System.exit() with a result code. Your shell would end prematurely.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What you don't realise is that none of these problems exist in the
</I>&gt;<i> current system. Just because System.exit() is the only way to return a
</I>&gt;<i> result code doesn't mean that Java can't use this returned value. When
</I>&gt;<i> you call Runtime.exec() it returns a Process object. You can wait for
</I>&gt;<i> the process to exit and then query it for its result code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly, just because you are using Runtime.exec() doesn't mean that
</I>&gt;<i> you are starting up a whole new JVM. It simply means you are starting up
</I>&gt;<i> a new process. This is how UNIX works. We can implement it the same way
</I>&gt;<i> with a modified JVM that can spawn new processes in a lightweight
</I>&gt;<i> manner. You mentioned that Sun insists that we don't do this. Well who
</I>&gt;<i> cares what Sun say. It is obviously possible.
</I>
we'll have to handle that carefully though, lots of messy stuff
 
&gt;<i> Your wish to have sub-programs running in the same process is a
</I>&gt;<i> dangerous approach. Even if you provide an alternate mechnism for
</I>&gt;<i> returning result codes, System.exit() is still there and used by nearly
</I>&gt;<i> every Java application in existence today. If a sub-program calls this,
</I>&gt;<i> your shell will also die, along with other sub-programs in the same
</I>&gt;<i> process. That is, unless you stick with the current program model where
</I>&gt;<i> you spawn new processes with the Runtime class (same way as UNIX). If
</I>&gt;<i> you impose a SecurityManager on programs which choose to call
</I>&gt;<i> System.exit(), they will crash. Only new programs written to your API
</I>&gt;<i> will work and I somehow don't think many people will want to switch.
</I>
I think Enchinda uses the System.exit/SecurityManager hack it &quot;exits&quot;
the program by stopping its execution and takes the result code
 
&gt;<i> &gt; More importantly, this gives us a unified model for JOS programs. When you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want to run a program from a shell, the shell can check for a program
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interface. The shell can run many programs, properly, with result codes,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; within a single JVM.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Refer to my points about this at the beginning of this email.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, this one I saved 'till last:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since applications, applets, servlets and aglets are different kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;programs&quot;, it becomes possible to unify all programs under a program API.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A program browser would provide a host environment for running (and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debugging!) all kinds of programs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not surprisingly, I am interested in the use of what you are proposing.
</I>&gt;<i> Debugging was something that caught my eye. I don't yet understand how a
</I>&gt;<i> unified API is useful for debugging, but if you can explain it to me,
</I>&gt;<i> there might be a use for this unified API after all.
</I>
Id like to hear that too

Cheers,

	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
