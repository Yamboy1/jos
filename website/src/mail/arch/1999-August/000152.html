I agree that pipes and redirection are useful. What I meant to say was
that of the two models for linking tiny programs together to achieve an
outcome, I think JavaBeans is more useful than UNIX pipes:

1. UNIX pipes are usually linear because UNIX processes typically read
from stdin and write to stdout. It is difficult to achieve the effect of
parallel and forking pipes.

2. JavaBeans have multiple entry points (one for each method) where as
UNIX processes have a single entry (stdin) and a dodgy way of switching
its function (command-line arguments).

3. It is possible to overlay pipes on top of JavaBeans in the cases
where pipes are extremely useful (eg. filters).

As for IPC, you are right that we definitely need streams. The
usefulness of method invocations (when it is desirable) can be emulated
through RMI on top of streams.
