Our search continues. We want to build a multiple &quot;process&quot; JVM. We might
need a multiple instances of a few JVM classes that all other JVMs consider
singletons. For example, we might have multiple instances of
PrimordialClassLoader, one class loader for each &quot;process&quot;. We might have
multiple instances java.lang.Runtime.

We might need multiple instances of java.lang.System, not because of
System.exit() which calls java.lang.Runtime, but because it holds
System.in, System.out, and System.err.

What is our approach to solving the unsolvable? Divide and conquer. How do
we find a mechanism for multiple processes in a single JVM? By dividing
this puzzle into Process and Program. Our approach has been to break the
puzzle into two independent problems. Solving one piece helps us understand
and solve the other. We work from the bottom up.

Instead of going after Process and ProcessContext directly, we are going
after Program and ProgramContext. What is the difference between a program
and process?

A process may be a fully independent environment. A process is similar to a
JVM running in a fully independent native process, in a traditional
JVM-runs-on-OS model. It has its own security manager. It has it own
instance of java.lang.Runtime. It has its own instance of java.lang.System
for in, out and err.

A program is a semi-independent environment. A program is similar to a
semi-independent thread, in a traditional JVM model. A program is not a
process. It does *not* have its own instance of java.lang.Runtime. It does
*not* have its own instance of java.lang.System.

And yet, Program and ProgramContext must support piping and redirection. So
far, my model proposes the equivalent of a System.in and System.out for a
IOStreamProgram. My model continue to use System.err as standard errors
stream, shared among all programs.

The Program - Release 1d package provides a few kinds of programs:

Program - This kind of program supports neither IOStreams, Console or
Terminal. This might be a good choice for GUI programs and daemons.

IOStreamProgram - This kind of program supports piping and redirection.
Instead of using System.in and System.out, you use getInputStream() and
getOutputStream() which returns the input/output streams for this program.

ConsoleProgram - This kind of program has a console, the equivalent of an
output stream; but no input stream. All of its input must come from a
parameter list. This might be a good choice for a servlet transaction and
many JOS commands. (What does $ ls &lt; x do anyway?)

TerminalProgram - This kind of program has a terminal, the equivalent of a
input and output stream. This might be a good choice for a command line
interface, like a classic shell (bash), shell script, browser plug-in or
Internet chat relay (IRC).

When a IOStreamProgram is run as a Java application, getInputStream()
returns System.in and getOutputStream() returns System.out.

How does this help? It demonstrates that you can already run
semi-independent &quot;programs&quot; inside all traditional JVMs. You do not have to
modify a JVM to do it.

What's the catch? You must trust that all of Programs are well-behaved.
Since the JOS Project is going to write lots of programs, we can safely
assume that all our programs are going to be well-behaved. Otherwise, it's
a bug. When the time comes, a well-behaved program will run--unchanged--in
a separate process.

I trust all code that I write. I trust all of the open source code that I
read and understand (in C, C++ and Java). I trust all code that trustworthy
people write. I trust code distributed by book publishers and many other
software vendors. I trust code until it's proven that I can't.

While a Program is built on trust, a Process is built upon dis-trust. Why
should I wait until a Process and ProcessContext is ready? Why should I
pass sentence on all my code so it must be confined to an off-brand
multiple process JVM? It doesn't have to be that way.
