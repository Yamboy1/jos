<PRE>Ah, into my field of study.  Unfortunately, after my change in jobs, I have
had very little time to work on this problem of discovery and storage.
When/if Wiki's back up, look at my page under DeviceArchitecture.

Subject: Re: [JOS-Kernel] the vga driver is working now


&gt;&gt;<i> Now we should start with a generic device loader (what do you think,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hilary? The shark examples are quite good). I'm also very interested in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> writing an IDE driver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The following paragraph is based upon only what I can remember from a
</I>cursory
&gt;<i>reading of both the &quot;Inside JavaOS&quot; book and the IBM &quot;JavaOS for Business&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>documentation (neither is in front of me now), so there's a distinct
</I>possibility
&gt;<i>that I can be really mistaken:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>JavaOS has this concept where they (apparently) unify the concept of a
</I>registry
&gt;<i>and the traditional UNIX &quot;/dev&quot; device entries, and driver entries, too.
</I>This
&gt;<i>Java-object tree gets populated when the device discovery is done at boot
</I>time,
&gt;<i>and then drivers are also elements of the tree.  Also, user preferences are
</I>&gt;<i>stored the same way somehow (serialization?).  Finally, they seem to one-up
</I>the
&gt;<i>concept of a registry in that, when a member of the tree is updated (e.g.,
</I>a
&gt;<i>hot-swappable device is discovered, or a new driver is loaded), then other
</I>Java
&gt;<i>objects can get notified, so they can remain in synchrony with the
</I>database.  It
&gt;<i>seems neat and elegant (which implies that maybe it'll be simpler to
</I>&gt;<i>implement?), and I'm thinking we should clone it.
</I>
I'm attempting to summarize my design/thoughts in quick words, so this might
get confusing...  My rough sketch of the device tree was initially based on
a combination of JavaOS's viewpoint, and Jini's device discovery/listing
tree.  I agree with JavaOS's design of placing devices in a &quot;/dev&quot; entry in
the registry, but I feel that applications should *NOT* have access to this.
It would create too large of a dependancy on the devices - when we know that
we want real-time add/remove/replace features for drivers.  Thus, we keep
the user from having to reboot at every minor device change.

Instead, I said that we should have a &quot;device interface&quot; layer in the
registry, which basically has a set of classes with links to the &quot;/dev&quot; or
&quot;/devInterface&quot; locations.  This way, applications which request a device
will be unaware of a device being replaced.  All that changes is the device
interface links.  Since this is in the registry, different threads/processes
can have different sets of device links.  This requires rewriting many of
the basic java.* classes so that they reference the registry's device links.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>(With respect to device-discovery, I have some pretty good documentation on
</I>the
&gt;<i>BIOS data areas, in which the BIOS stores the results of its device-probing
</I>&gt;<i>activities.  Now that we can read physical memory, we can stroll through
</I>this
&gt;<i>area and find out exactly what devices are in the box.  I'm more than
</I>willing to
&gt;<i>help out here...)
</I>
The reason why I initially volunteered to cover device-discovery (which bled
into the whole device architecture) was that I have some good plug-n-play
documentation, as well as a history of device driver implementation in DOS.
Ah, those were the days...

&gt;<i>Fabulous work -- congratulations!!

Good going on the VGA driver.  Anyone up for writing a MGA driver? :)
