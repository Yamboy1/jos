whats wrong with just making applications that act as a &quot;default&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;relies on a very unique environment. For example, an HTTP servlet relies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;on the fact that it can access various information in the HTTP header of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;a request. It relies on the fact that its instance can persist between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;invocations, so it can keep a database connection open (for example).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Both of these dependencies bar servlets from being invoked in a uniform
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;manner with other types of programs. For example, you just can't run a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;servlet from the command-line. It doesn't make any sense.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, well, sort of. Servlets run inside a servlet engine. Sun provides a
</I>&gt;<i> servletrunner, so you don't have to have a separate HTTP service.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Warning: This information might be shocking to all those who follow Sun
</I>&gt;<i> Microsystems wherever they go. Sun's website very clearly states that this
</I>&gt;<i> can't be done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, you run servlets from a command line. When I run this command from
</I>&gt;<i> my HTML browser, or rather its location field, it invokes a servlet. The
</I>&gt;<i> location field is-a command line.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://localhost:8080/servlet/org.jos.demo.DemoServlet">http://localhost:8080/servlet/org.jos.demo.DemoServlet</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Second, servlets are based exclusively on *streams*, not TCP/IP. A
</I>&gt;<i> servletrunner provides ServletInputStreams and ServletOutputStream to a
</I>&gt;<i> servlet, so that a servlet doesn't need to know about TCP/IP connections.
</I>&gt;<i> There are no dependencies that prevent servlets from running elsewhere.
</I>&gt;<i> There is no need for a servlet engine to use TCP/IP--even for HTTP servlets.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your servlet get HTTP header information from a ServletInputStream. It
</I>&gt;<i> writes HTTP header information to a ServletOutputStream. It doesn't need to
</I>&gt;<i> connect with a requestor using a TCP/IP connection.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why would anyone want to? As a Java programmer, I need to build servlets in
</I>&gt;<i> the shortest amount of time possible. Debugging a servlet *inside* the
</I>&gt;<i> servletrunner is less than optimum for debugging servlets. You can set
</I>&gt;<i> break-points inside your servlet code. Yes, you can even create debugging
</I>&gt;<i> frames and dialog boxes (only used during testing). I would rather debug my
</I>&gt;<i> servlets in a plain-text browser. Hey, that's what I'm doing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the location field of my plain-text browser, I type the following URI:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> x-servlet:org.jos.demo.DemoServlet
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My plain-text browser will provide a servlet environment completely free of
</I>&gt;<i> TCP/IP connections. It will load and run any servlet, just like the servlet
</I>&gt;<i> specification says. The output from the servlet is displayed in plain text,
</I>&gt;<i> so that I can look at the raw HTML, to make sure the servlet produces the
</I>&gt;<i> HTML code that I want it to. It will be fast. It will be direct. My
</I>&gt;<i> plain-text browser will be easy to restart (with a restart button) so that
</I>&gt;<i> I can recompile my servlet frequently and start a new &quot;session&quot; whenever I
</I>&gt;<i> want.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After I get the servlet working, then I move to a more complicated
</I>&gt;<i> environment, using an HTML browser, a servletrunner tool, and TCP/IP.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> x-servlet:org.jos.demo.DemoServlet
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> is equivalent to
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://localhost:8080/servlet/org.jos.demo.DemoServlet">http://localhost:8080/servlet/org.jos.demo.DemoServlet</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Parameters are passed with a standard query string. I can quickly test
</I>&gt;<i> different combinations of parameters and instantly see the results. When I
</I>&gt;<i> pause a servlet right in the middle of building an HTML file, I see all
</I>&gt;<i> output that has been written so far.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sidebar: You can run servlets on the client-side. Every machine that has a
</I>&gt;<i> JVM is capable of being a &quot;server&quot;. If you integrate servletrunner into
</I>&gt;<i> your client-side Java application, you can run servlets on the client-side.
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds strange only because Sun mis-named them &quot;servlets&quot;, giving everyone
</I>&gt;<i> the mistaken impression that they only run on the server-side.
</I>
ok, you made a good point about how one should be able to test ones
servlet; but how does this argue that they HAVE to be a Program?

isnt a Servlet (at the very top) just an interface (what they should
have done with Applet, btw) and isnt it unasuming about HTTP, that is
not locked to it? Ive always thought of a Servlet as a service-let not a
server-let, just a handy stream based IPO plugin.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;- An applet is also very different from a command-line program. The key
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;quality of an Applet is that it is a part of a larger entity. It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;requires this entity to be useful. An applet cannot be executed unless
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;it is in a web page. The applet is very aware that it is in a web page.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;It can read its applet parameters which are defined in the web page, it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;can communicate with other applets that are in the web page, it can even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;make another web page load. Because of its different nature, it can't be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;treated in a similar way to applications or servlets. Another point is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that you don't really invoke an applet (as you do with the programs you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;speak of), you &quot;embed&quot; it in an application specific way that is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;provided by the applet itself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, well, sort of. Applets run inside an applet engine. Sun provides a
</I>&gt;<i> appletrunner, so you don't have to have a separate HTML browser.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, you can definitely run applets outside a browser. You can run the
</I>&gt;<i> appletrunner, right?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Second, you can definitely run applets without HTML. This might be a
</I>&gt;<i> surprise to all those who use Sun's brain-dead appletrunner tool. But, it
</I>&gt;<i> is no surprise to those using JavaBee. Check out the wonderful JavaBee
</I>&gt;<i> product at &lt;URL:<A HREF="http://www.javabee.com/">http://www.javabee.com/</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My applet browser provides a simple way to run applets with support for
</I>&gt;<i> parameters. In the location field of my applet browser, I type the
</I>&gt;<i> following URI:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> x-applet:org.jos.demo.DemoApplet
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My applet browser provides an applet environment completely free of HTML.
</I>&gt;<i> It loads and runs an applet, just like the applet specification says. The
</I>&gt;<i> output from the applet is displayed in a frame, so that I reside the applet
</I>&gt;<i> and interact with its visual components, to make sure the applet behaves
</I>&gt;<i> the way I want it to. It is fast. It is direct. My applet browser is easy
</I>&gt;<i> to restart (with a restart button) so that I can recompile my applet
</I>&gt;<i> frequently. I invoke an applet with exactly the same mechanism as I invoke
</I>&gt;<i> a servlet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Parameters are passed with a standard query string. I can test different
</I>&gt;<i> combinations of parameters. Feedback is immediate. No bulky HTML browser is
</I>&gt;<i> required.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My applet browser supports the showDocument() and showStatus() methods
</I>&gt;<i> required by the applet environment. The showDocument() method overwrites
</I>&gt;<i> the location field with a new URI, but does not automatically run it. I can
</I>&gt;<i> look at the output from showDocument() to see if looks right.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then, I move up to embedding an applet on an HTML page.
</I>
ok, these arguemnts are definitley good for using URI's for everything
(&quot;JOS putting the U in URI&quot; --how market does that sound?) but still not
so much an argument for Program.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;- Applications (both gui and command-line) are intended to be invoked.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Applications are a unique type of program that are designed to carry out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;a task and return to the shell, or carry out tasks given through a user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;interface until the user wishes to exit the application. These types of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;programs are the only programs that are suitable for shells because they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;can be invoked, they have a clearly defined lifespan, and a definite way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;of returning to the shell.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly! Applications &quot;carry out tasks given through a user interface until
</I>&gt;<i> the user wishes to exit the application.&quot; That's a key difference between
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;applications&quot; and &quot;programs&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My program browser--you guessed it--runs programs. It provides a simple way
</I>&gt;<i> to run programs with full support for parameters. In the location field of
</I>&gt;<i> my program browser, I type the following URI:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> x-program:org.jos.demo.DemoProgram
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The standard output from the DemoProgram is display just like the
</I>&gt;<i> plain-text browser.
</I>
I can see Programs being an internal abstraction used to work with all
programs uniformly (with proxies like ServletProgram) but I dont see
making people use them.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;Not surprisingly, I am interested in the use of what you are proposing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Debugging was something that caught my eye. I don't yet understand how a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;unified API is useful for debugging, but if you can explain it to me,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;there might be a use for this unified API after all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the end, I wish to combine all specialized browsers into a unified JOS
</I>&gt;<i> browser. Here is what you'll be able to debug and demonstrate within a
</I>&gt;<i> single application:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Protocol - Program Type - Status
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> run:os: - native OS processes - complete
</I>&gt;<i> run:jose: - José applications - complete
</I>&gt;<i> multi - (file:, http:, x-registry:, in:*, out:*) - complete
</I>&gt;<i> x-applet: - Java applets - almost complete
</I>&gt;<i> x-archive - JOS archive browser (.cab, .gz, .jar, .zip) - not started yet
</I>&gt;<i> x-servlet: - Java servlets - needs more work
</I>&gt;<i> x-program: - JOS programs - needs more work
</I>&gt;<i> x-aglet: - Java aglets - not started yet
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What does this mean? It means that you can build a servlet that dynamically
</I>&gt;<i> creates an HTML index of all your applications, applets, programs, native
</I>&gt;<i> programs, archives, and other servlets. You click on the digital resource
</I>&gt;<i> you want to invoke. Ta-da! You get one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you want it all? You can have it all. You can mix and match until you
</I>&gt;<i> get dizzy and your head hurts. We live in a brave new world where programs
</I>&gt;<i> are multiply connected.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - You can download and run Java bytecode from anywhere (if that's what you
</I>&gt;<i> really want).
</I>&gt;<i> - You can build a program that runs as a program...and a servlet.
</I>&gt;<i> - You can build a Java application that runs as a Java application...or a
</I>&gt;<i> program or servlet.
</I>&gt;<i> - You can build an applet that runs as an applet...and a program.
</I>&gt;<i> - You can run a servlet that runs as a servlet...and a program.
</I>&gt;<i> - You can run a native program as a native program...and a servlet.
</I>&gt;<i> - Your aglet can roam around and bring back its search results as a
</I>&gt;<i> program, applet, or servlet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - It is recursive, too. So that you can launch an applet that starts a
</I>&gt;<i> program that uses servlets that use native programs. You can do anything
</I>&gt;<i> you want.
</I>
this, again, is an argument for URI's and smart browsers but not
Programs (although again I can see its use internally, especially by
your browser)
 
&gt;<i> As an operating system, JOS should take advantage of some of the
</I>&gt;<i> combinations that make the most sense. For example, the ls command should
</I>&gt;<i> be available as a program, a Java application, and a servlet. When you
</I>&gt;<i> invoke the ls command from within your HTML browser, the results should be
</I>&gt;<i> returned as (1) plain-text or (2) full HTML code. Here is where program
</I>&gt;<i> inheritence becomes critically important.
</I>
you can do that now though, add a main() to your servlet. implementing
program is pointless... (except on a IS-A basis, but then the interface
might just as well be empty)
 
&gt;<i> We should have a plain-text ls program. The HTML version of the ls program
</I>&gt;<i> should extend the plain-text version. Both have identical functionality.
</I>&gt;<i> While one runs as a program or Java application, the other runs as a
</I>&gt;<i> servlet. You can browse around your JOS OS file subsystem using your HTML
</I>&gt;<i> browser on a local machine or across the Internet.
</I>
you could do that now
 
&gt;<i> We can be compatible with other names for ls. The dir command can use the
</I>&gt;<i> ls program. The dir command takes much different command line parameters
</I>&gt;<i> than ls. The dir command should translate command line parameters, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, and then call the ls command. See, that's why we need to run
</I>&gt;<i> programs within the same process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or, the ls and dir commands could use a brand-new JOS program with a new
</I>&gt;<i> name that does file-listing better than any other operating system.
</I>
the LS command could also be extended to open as a window (you know the
little windows on the desktop with all the icons of the current
directory, not explorer but you know what Im talking about)
 
&gt;<i> Here is one for the road. JOS command-line utilities should consistently
</I>&gt;<i> recognize the -html option. This command-line parameter tells a program
</I>&gt;<i> when it should output HTML code to standard out. When the servletrunner
</I>&gt;<i> runs a program as a servlet, it should automatically pass the -html option
</I>&gt;<i> to all of our JOS command-line utilities.
</I>
well HTML is to C++ what XML is to Java if you get my meaning, but i can
see how this would be useful (also still not an argument for Program)

Cheers,
