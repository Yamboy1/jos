There is definately some useful functionality you could put in an
abstract base class (command line parsing, for example), but I think
this functionality is more reusable if it is provided as a library.
Delegation is a much more flexible design than inheritance. Even more so
in the case of Java because it does not support multiple implementation
inheritance. So, for example, if you wanted to reuse the command-line
processing functionality in an Applet, you couldn't extend the abstract
base class because applets already extend Applet.

Since my style of programming is to have very small main() methods, I
personally wouldn't gain much from inheriting functionality from a
framework-type base class, but I accept that other people have their own
preference. The main point is that if I choose not to extend
Application, or even implement Program, my programs should still work
under JOS. I would think that the vast majority of programmers will
stick to the program interface that Sun designed rather than use an
interface that someone else wrote. I'm still not sure about the purpose
of Gilbert's unified program interface but whatever the purpose, it
would be (IMHO) best to achieve that purpose without making programs
implement a non-standard interface.
