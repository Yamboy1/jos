ok, I see what your saying. But Script.Element is for reflection from
the script to java not java to the script. that is a Scriptable wouldn't
return arrays of Script.Elements (but a Script could generate those
Elements--assuming support--after the Scriptable was plugged in) I mean
I suppose it could, but that still gets into my general problem of how
to do it generically...  But your right, reflection would be required
for access to the Scriptable... but that should be taken care of in
Script so the children dont have to be bothered by it and the code
should be hidden...

something like:

get the Scriptables ScriptInfo...
add the methods into the scripts namespace(?)...
when its called do (and cache) the reflection in the background...

that doesnt really get the idea across, but I cant think of how to
better explain it
 

&gt;<i> &gt; I read an article on a &quot;generic listner&quot; that used reflection to accept
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; events of any type... maybe we could make our own, it'd be more generic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then ScriptManager that serves the same --but broader-- purpose.
</I>&gt;<i>         That would be the way to do it, definitely.
</I>
I'll have to reread the article then, I think I d'loaded the source...

where would something like that go? org.jos.util.genericlistner?
(digigod.util.genericlistner for now)

Cheers,

	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial

	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
