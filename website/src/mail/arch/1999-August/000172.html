</I>
ok, why not just do this. the Program interface can have a
ServletProgram an AppletProgram and all it creates these internally in
your browser as a generic way to handle them, theres no reason to use it
system wide that I can see
 
&gt;<i> Our uniform browser would be much simpler. Given any URI, the uniform
</I>&gt;<i> browser would able to do handle it:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> :
</I>&gt;<i> Object o = new URI( uri ).getObject();
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> if ( o instanceof Program ) {
</I>&gt;<i>   runProgram( (Program) o );
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> if ( o instanceof InputStream ) {
</I>&gt;<i>   displayInput( (InputStream) o );
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I propose the Program and ProgramContext as a simple way to write programs
</I>&gt;<i> now that will run on JOS through a consistent in-process mechanism. I
</I>&gt;<i> believe that implementations of Program is more object-oriented than static
</I>&gt;<i> main() and provides better support for inheritence. Program and
</I>&gt;<i> ProgramContext do not depend on the reflection API.
</I>
no one should be forced to do this though
 
&gt;<i> &gt;ok, you made a good point about how one should be able to test ones
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;servlet; but how does this argue that they HAVE to be a Program?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A servlet does not have to implement the Program interface. A servlet
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to run any program. The output from any program should be
</I>&gt;<i> piped through the response output stream. You can create a generic servlet
</I>&gt;<i> that can run programs by program name. You can pass parameters to the
</I>&gt;<i> program with a query string.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An HTML browser should be able to run any program, including the
</I>&gt;<i> ServletProgram. In the marketplace, people might use a JOS browser
</I>&gt;<i> *because* it can run servlets without an HTTP service.
</I>
your HTML browser seems to be a &quot;do everything&quot; app, at least your doing
it right by not trying to do it all at once... but why not just make the
OS/UI an OO version of unix (that is a buncha small things that are
dynamically thrown together to create &quot;sponteneous applications&quot; from
beans and the like based on the current situations needs)
 
&gt;<i> &gt;isnt a Servlet (at the very top) just an interface (what they should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;have done with Applet, btw) and isnt it unasuming about HTTP, that is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;not locked to it? Ive always thought of a Servlet as a service-let not a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;server-let, just a handy stream based IPO plugin.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, thankfully. Servlet is an interface. It seems that Sun Microsystems
</I>&gt;<i> may have learned something after all. It is unassuming about HTTP, too. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not sure what to call it. It is something like a Java I/O Bean.
</I>
I think SUN bashing isnt going to help anything, they didnt do it
perfect; but nobodys perfect. the JavaLobby is the yin to their yang so
that kinda talk should go on there; otherwise we should just worry about
JOS.

I think IPO plugin is more accurate then I/O Bean (but maybe thats just
because I said it ;)
 
&gt;<i> &gt;(&quot;JOS putting the U in URI&quot; --how market does that sound?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> JOS is a future-oriented operating system. We are trying to make JOS more
</I>&gt;<i> uniform than any other operating system. In a sense, we are re-defining the
</I>&gt;<i> U in URI.
</I>
not redefing it, just using it :)
 
&gt;<i> &gt;I can see Programs being an internal abstraction used to work with all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;programs uniformly (with proxies like ServletProgram) but I dont see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;making people use them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're right. I'm not trying to change the way everybody else writes code.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to change the way I write code. I would like all my Java
</I>&gt;<i> programs to run inside a strong OO model. Could there will be more
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;programs&quot; in JOS?
</I>
ok, that last sentence didnt translate well. but, I think I see what
your saying...
you have a ProgramRunner that your app uses to interface with programs,
all programs, but you dont need to implement program because the
ProgramRunner creates an appropriate proxy (for a servlet it creates a
ServletProgram, etc). any program can use the program runner as it is
part of the program library; no one needs to use it.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;this, again, is an argument for URI's and smart browsers but not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Programs (although again I can see its use internally, especially by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;your browser)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I want a ProgramFactory plugged into the ObjectFactory. Each object
</I>&gt;<i> returned by the ProgramFactory must be an implementation of Program. That's
</I>&gt;<i> what makes the smart browser possible. Otherwise, the smart browser would
</I>&gt;<i> be complicated with having to too much.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And probably more important for architecture, I want any Java object to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to run any JOS program the minimum number of lines of code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Think about what it takes to learn how to run a program using the
</I>&gt;<i> reflection API. Many Java programmers won't want to learn all that just to
</I>&gt;<i> run a program.
</I>
its pretty simple... and I can see this as an argument for internal use
 
&gt;<i> Think about how easy it will be to write a scripting language to run one
</I>&gt;<i> JOS program after another. It does not have the overhead of separate
</I>&gt;<i> processes. It works without a modified JVM. It even works in Java 1.0.2.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What does a JOS batch file look like? It looks a lot like a URI list. If
</I>&gt;<i> one of these programs returns a non-zero result code, the script is shut down.
</I>
I dont think we should have a &quot;JOS batch file&quot; just the GSI.
 
&gt;<i> #org.jos.shellscript.Script
</I>&gt;<i> x-program:org.jos.demo.DemoProgram
</I>&gt;<i> x-program:org.jos.demo.DemoServlet
</I>&gt;<i> run:os:mkdir temp
</I>&gt;<i> run:os:cp * .
</I>&gt;<i> x-program:org.jos.demo.DemoApplet
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For those working on a generic scripting API, a script is a kind of
</I>&gt;<i> program, too.
</I>
well a script is a plugin to GSI kinda, theres a ScriptRunner
Application but you could make a ScriptProgram for internal use in your
browser easily (although using GSI directly would offer many benifts)
 
&gt;<i> We should build a JOS demonstration script. It should show off all of the
</I>&gt;<i> things you can do with JOS that all the other operating systems can only
</I>&gt;<i> dream about. Wouldn't you be impressed with an operating system that runs
</I>&gt;<i> all of the Java applications, applets and servlets you already wrote? I would.
</I>
this is the goal, alright
 
&gt;<i> Oh, and did I mention piping? You can do it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> x-program:org.jos.demo.DemoProgram &gt; temp/log.txt
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;you can do that now though, add a main() to your servlet. implementing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;program is pointless... (except on a IS-A basis, but then the interface
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;might just as well be empty)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why should I go back and add main() to my old applets and servlets when I
</I>&gt;<i> don't have to? It doesn't have to be that way. Once I have AppletProgram
</I>&gt;<i> and ServletProgram and ApplicationProgram, I'm done. Further, I can use
</I>&gt;<i> (and test) all those Java applications, applets and servlets that other
</I>&gt;<i> people write.
</I>
this is an argument for Program, /internally/
 
&gt;<i> And I keep forgetting to mention this. You can &quot;run&quot; any Java class that
</I>&gt;<i> implements java.awt.Component. You can also &quot;run&quot; any Java class that is a
</I>&gt;<i> Java Bean. The uniform browser uses URIs in the location field. It also
</I>&gt;<i> uses shortcuts and shortcut editor so that you don't have to create a URI
</I>&gt;<i> manually.
</I>
this sounds kinda like BeanBox on angel dust
 
&gt;<i> What is a shortcut? It might as well be any registry-compatible file with a
</I>&gt;<i> uri property.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> uri=x-component:java.awt.Button?label=&quot;Hello, World!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It might help to &quot;browse&quot; around a new component library to see what
</I>&gt;<i> everything looks like. When you want to learn the AWT or Swing, would you
</I>&gt;<i> like to see each component as it works at runtime? Would you like to see
</I>&gt;<i> all components within the same component browser? When other programmers
</I>&gt;<i> receive a copy of our JOS distribution (someday), they will want to see
</I>&gt;<i> what's there. I think we can easily put together a point-and-click tour of
</I>&gt;<i> all kinds of components, even those components added at the &quot;last minute&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> And more, when other people ship component librarys for JOS, all those
</I>&gt;<i> components will be assimilated into the JOS demo program.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Think about the JOS out-of-box experience. Based on the strengh of Java, we
</I>&gt;<i> can re-define the concept of &quot;try before you buy&quot;. We can create a JOS
</I>&gt;<i> distribution that people can run components--before they are installed--to
</I>&gt;<i> see what they look like. They can download the uniform browser and take JOS
</I>&gt;<i> for a test drive before downloading a JOS distribution. They start the
</I>&gt;<i> uniform browser from a CD-ROM and start browsing around.
</I>
why not just put the JOS installer on the CD and have it setup so you
can run the browser to test it, it would be nice if we could give these
CD's out for free; unless you have broadband noones downloading an OS 
 
&gt;<i> Our installation/configuration programs are written in Java and run
</I>&gt;<i> unchanged on 22 platforms. The Linux community could use JOS to make Linux
</I>&gt;<i> easier to install.
</I>
I could imagine that would be somewhat emasculating for Linux
 
&gt;<i> When we reach higher than a high level third generation language like Java,
</I>&gt;<i> we need a strong model for programs. Using an interactive, visual IDE, you
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to configure even the most complicated program. The
</I>&gt;<i> configuration of a single step program is reduced to a single URI. A
</I>&gt;<i> step-by-step script is reduced to a URI list.
</I>
you should make your shortcut file so it can run a URI, a list of URI's
a script or any combination. now that would be cool
 
&gt;<i> A uniform browser puts any digital resource within your reach. You can
</I>&gt;<i> create a shortcut for it. You can write a program that uses it. You can do
</I>&gt;<i> whatever you want.
</I>
why have a browser though? why not just build most of this into JADE?
say you click on a HTML file on your desktop, it sends the URI to the
launcher which locates the right JavaBean and opens it up, if the HTML
file has JavaScript in it the HTML bean tells the OS which hands it a
GSI interface for JavaScript. a sponteneus application, of sorts.
 
&gt;<i> We need to reduce a program to its bare essentials. It must be platform
</I>&gt;<i> independent. It must assume neither UNIX(tm)-style or MS-DOS-style command
</I>&gt;<i> line parameters. That's better left to an abstract base class.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sun Microsystems went too far. They reduced it to pre-object oriented
</I>&gt;<i> static main() from C. It must have been reassuring to C programmers that
</I>&gt;<i> started writing Java code.
</I>
it was, another way around this is to make your apps all OO, and have a
script to launch them. outsourcing main() basically.
