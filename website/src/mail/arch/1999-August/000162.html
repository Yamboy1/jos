In an object-oriented world, a program is an object, not a class. A JOS
program should be an object, too. You should be able to use a program like
other objects.

A smart object factory should be able to return an object--not a
class--when you want to load a JOS program. Let's go back to the
DemoProgram, again. When I type this URI into my program browser, it should
return an instance of the DemoProgram.

x-program:org.jos.demo.DemoProgram

  public void example() {
    exec( &quot;x-program:org.jos.demo.DemoProgram&quot; ); 
  }
  public int exec( String uri ) {
    try {
      Program p = (Program) new URI( uri ).getObject();
    }
    catch( ClassCastException e ) {
      return;
    }
    p.setProgramContext( whatever );
    p.run();
    return whatever.getResultCode();
  }

When we have a smart object factory that can create all kinds of digital
resources, it would be straight forward to create a smart program factory.

- If I pass the name of a class that implements the Program interface, the
factory returns a Program object.

- If I pass the name of a class that implements the java.awt.Applet
interface, the factory returns a Program object.

- If I pass the name of a class that implements the javax.servlet.Servlet
interface, the factory returns a Program object.

- In Java 1.1 and higher, if I pass the name of a class that declares
static main(), the factory returns a Program object.

Our uniform browser would be much simpler. Given any URI, the uniform
browser would able to do handle it:

:<i>
</I>Object o = new URI( uri ).getObject();

if ( o instanceof Program ) {
  runProgram( (Program) o );
}
if ( o instanceof InputStream ) {
  displayInput( (InputStream) o );
}
:<i>
</I>
I propose the Program and ProgramContext as a simple way to write programs
now that will run on JOS through a consistent in-process mechanism. I
believe that implementations of Program is more object-oriented than static
main() and provides better support for inheritence. Program and
ProgramContext do not depend on the reflection API.

&gt;<i>ok, you made a good point about how one should be able to test ones
</I>&gt;<i>servlet; but how does this argue that they HAVE to be a Program?
</I>
A servlet does not have to implement the Program interface. A servlet
should be able to run any program. The output from any program should be
piped through the response output stream. You can create a generic servlet
that can run programs by program name. You can pass parameters to the
program with a query string.

An HTML browser should be able to run any program, including the
ServletProgram. In the marketplace, people might use a JOS browser
*because* it can run servlets without an HTTP service.

&gt;<i>isnt a Servlet (at the very top) just an interface (what they should
</I>&gt;<i>have done with Applet, btw) and isnt it unasuming about HTTP, that is
</I>&gt;<i>not locked to it? Ive always thought of a Servlet as a service-let not a
</I>&gt;<i>server-let, just a handy stream based IPO plugin.
</I>
Yes, thankfully. Servlet is an interface. It seems that Sun Microsystems
may have learned something after all. It is unassuming about HTTP, too. I'm
not sure what to call it. It is something like a Java I/O Bean.
 
&gt;<i>(&quot;JOS putting the U in URI&quot; --how market does that sound?)
</I>
JOS is a future-oriented operating system. We are trying to make JOS more
uniform than any other operating system. In a sense, we are re-defining the
U in URI.

&gt;<i>I can see Programs being an internal abstraction used to work with all
</I>&gt;<i>programs uniformly (with proxies like ServletProgram) but I dont see
</I>&gt;<i>making people use them.
</I>
You're right. I'm not trying to change the way everybody else writes code.
I'm trying to change the way I write code. I would like all my Java
programs to run inside a strong OO model. Could there will be more
&quot;programs&quot; in JOS?
 
&gt;<i>this, again, is an argument for URI's and smart browsers but not
</I>&gt;<i>Programs (although again I can see its use internally, especially by
</I>&gt;<i>your browser)
</I>
I want a ProgramFactory plugged into the ObjectFactory. Each object
returned by the ProgramFactory must be an implementation of Program. That's
what makes the smart browser possible. Otherwise, the smart browser would
be complicated with having to too much.

And probably more important for architecture, I want any Java object to be
able to run any JOS program the minimum number of lines of code.

Think about what it takes to learn how to run a program using the
reflection API. Many Java programmers won't want to learn all that just to
run a program.

Think about how easy it will be to write a scripting language to run one
JOS program after another. It does not have the overhead of separate
processes. It works without a modified JVM. It even works in Java 1.0.2.

What does a JOS batch file look like? It looks a lot like a URI list. If
one of these programs returns a non-zero result code, the script is shut down.

#org.jos.shellscript.Script
x-program:org.jos.demo.DemoProgram
x-program:org.jos.demo.DemoServlet
run:os:mkdir temp
run:os:cp * .
x-program:org.jos.demo.DemoApplet

For those working on a generic scripting API, a script is a kind of
program, too.

We should build a JOS demonstration script. It should show off all of the
things you can do with JOS that all the other operating systems can only
dream about. Wouldn't you be impressed with an operating system that runs
all of the Java applications, applets and servlets you already wrote? I would.

Oh, and did I mention piping? You can do it.

x-program:org.jos.demo.DemoProgram &gt; temp/log.txt

&gt;<i>you can do that now though, add a main() to your servlet. implementing
</I>&gt;<i>program is pointless... (except on a IS-A basis, but then the interface
</I>&gt;<i>might just as well be empty)
</I>
Why should I go back and add main() to my old applets and servlets when I
don't have to? It doesn't have to be that way. Once I have AppletProgram
and ServletProgram and ApplicationProgram, I'm done. Further, I can use
(and test) all those Java applications, applets and servlets that other
people write.

And I keep forgetting to mention this. You can &quot;run&quot; any Java class that
implements java.awt.Component. You can also &quot;run&quot; any Java class that is a
Java Bean. The uniform browser uses URIs in the location field. It also
uses shortcuts and shortcut editor so that you don't have to create a URI
manually.

What is a shortcut? It might as well be any registry-compatible file with a
uri property.

uri=x-component:java.awt.Button?label=&quot;Hello, World!&quot;

It might help to &quot;browse&quot; around a new component library to see what
everything looks like. When you want to learn the AWT or Swing, would you
like to see each component as it works at runtime? Would you like to see
all components within the same component browser? When other programmers
receive a copy of our JOS distribution (someday), they will want to see
what's there. I think we can easily put together a point-and-click tour of
all kinds of components, even those components added at the &quot;last minute&quot;.
And more, when other people ship component librarys for JOS, all those
components will be assimilated into the JOS demo program.

Think about the JOS out-of-box experience. Based on the strengh of Java, we
can re-define the concept of &quot;try before you buy&quot;. We can create a JOS
distribution that people can run components--before they are installed--to
see what they look like. They can download the uniform browser and take JOS
for a test drive before downloading a JOS distribution. They start the
uniform browser from a CD-ROM and start browsing around.

Our installation/configuration programs are written in Java and run
unchanged on 22 platforms. The Linux community could use JOS to make Linux
easier to install.

When we reach higher than a high level third generation language like Java,
we need a strong model for programs. Using an interactive, visual IDE, you
should be able to configure even the most complicated program. The
configuration of a single step program is reduced to a single URI. A
step-by-step script is reduced to a URI list.

A uniform browser puts any digital resource within your reach. You can
create a shortcut for it. You can write a program that uses it. You can do
whatever you want.

We need to reduce a program to its bare essentials. It must be platform
independent. It must assume neither UNIX(tm)-style or MS-DOS-style command
line parameters. That's better left to an abstract base class.

Sun Microsystems went too far. They reduced it to pre-object oriented
static main() from C. It must have been reassuring to C programmers that
started writing Java code.
