<PRE>Hi,

    Writing a good Generic Driver Model in i386-pc is very hard. IMO, I would
better to keep
all the drivers as simple as they can. We can divided PC Device in two catalogs.

1. Stream and Event Type Driver ( Keyboard, HD, Floppy, etc )
2. Non-Stream Type Driver ( Graphics Adaptor )

Since HD can have event from DMA Processor. Keyboard and Mouse also can be a
stream.
So I would like to join these into same group. For Graphics Adaptor, it is a
Memory/IO/IRQ
Device. But it would not be a stream type driver.

For those isLoaded(), hasDriver() methods, these methods should be put it into a
Generic
Device Manager to control how many instances should be keep. If we put these
things to
driver and let them to control it, it would be little bit dangerous.

For autodetection mechianism, should we put it into generic driver spec. ? it
depends. We
can divided PC Devices into three catalogs :
1. USB Device -- A USB Manager can auto-detect all the things.
2. COM, PARALLEL, IDE, SCSI -- These devices got well defined auto-detect
mechianism, it can
put  it into a generic device manager to handle it.
3. PC-Card like network card , sound card, etc -- These devices are complicated.
Auto-Detection mechianism maybe make the computer hangs. It would be better to
put auto-detect mechianism into
driver itself.

Regards,

Hilary

</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Driver interfaces with the actual device to accomplish something.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;so JOS would know the ScannerDevice but the manufacturer would need to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;provide a ScannerDriver
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This was meant to separate the discovery/setup functionality from the
</I>&gt;<i> operational use.  Also, it enables the Device to store its state in a device
</I>&gt;<i> registry for easy recovery.  So, to answer your question: the ScannerDevice
</I>&gt;<i> would need a ScannerUSBDevice, ScannerSCSIDevice, ScannerParallelDevice, and
</I>&gt;<i> so on.  Each of these devices would subclass from the USBDevice, SCSIDevice,
</I>&gt;<i> &amp;c, and implement the ScannerDeviceInterface (or possibly the other way
</I>&gt;<i> around - SCSIDevice is an interface, and ScannerDevice is a class.  I
</I>&gt;<i> haven't played around with this, so we'll have to see what works best).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I wrote the KeyboardDevice, it had the discovery/setup code, as well as
</I>&gt;<i> the very basic methods to get scancodes from the device.  The KeyboardDriver
</I>&gt;<i> translated these scancodes into usable data.  So we could have a
</I>&gt;<i> ISAKeyboardDevice, linked to a ISAKeyboardTranslator (which translates
</I>&gt;<i> scancodes into VA_? keycodes; this is a &quot;pass-through&quot; driver), which is
</I>&gt;<i> linked to KeyboardPressedSet (monitors the press/release state of each VA_?
</I>&gt;<i> key) and USAKeyboardDriver (which translates the VA_? push/release keycodes
</I>&gt;<i> into uppercase, lowercase, special shift combinations, and num-pad character
</I>&gt;<i> creation).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I guess we can look at a Device simplisticly as a standard I/O Device
</I>&gt;<i> which inputs a byte stream, and outputs a byte stream.  Of course,
</I>&gt;<i> specialized subclasses (like the KeyboardDevice, with its specialized
</I>&gt;<i> implementations) do a tad bit more than that.  Or maybe we could look at a
</I>&gt;<i> Device as either a stream device (like a hard drive), or as an event device
</I>&gt;<i> (like a keyboard or mouse), or as both (like a modem or ethernet card).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; For instance, I pegged the video driver type to have a change mode
</I>&gt;<i> method,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and a method to collect the java.awt.GraphicsContext for the different
</I>&gt;<i> modes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (we may need a special method/context class for returning text modes).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;it should be vetoable by the OS(|UI).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes!!!  Thus, we really will have bean devices!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;firstly its GraphicsConfiguration that your thinking of, and it should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;be able to describe text mode (after reviewing the source)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That was off the top of my head, so I'll take your word for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;whats the PrimaryHardwareManager (and why's it primary? shouldnt it be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;static HardwareManager PrimaryHardwareManager; in the HM class? with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;getPrimaryHardwareManager()?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah.  That was a beast unto itself.  That was my cut at handling platform
</I>&gt;<i> resources (like I/O Addresses, Memory, DMA, interrupts, and so on).  The
</I>&gt;<i> primary hardware manager handled routing the resource request to the
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate manager.  It was interesting in that it handled plug-n-play
</I>&gt;<i> well, where a device may request the best fit for a set of resources (for
</I>&gt;<i> instance, a Sound Blaster Pro needs one of IRQ 2, 5, 7, or 10).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't use a static primary hardware manager, because I have a natural
</I>&gt;<i> aversion to using static data.  It leads to nasty situations where one
</I>&gt;<i> thread may need one kind of a class, and another thread needs a slightly
</I>&gt;<i> different class, or someone decides to use a different implementation in the
</I>&gt;<i> middle of runtime.  I was *especially* weary of this with a system level
</I>&gt;<i> variable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;is name its device name? or its HRF name? (getHRName() also if its the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;former), how about a getDescription() so a DeviceManager (config app)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;can give some info.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Name for the Device would be the unique name for the device, such as PNP0600
</I>&gt;<i> (Generic ESDI/IDE/ATA hard disk controller), PNP0102 (MCA timers), and so
</I>&gt;<i> on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;what about some state info, like isLoaded(), isActive() or hasDriver()?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure.  This was my first cut, where I wanted to leave it as open as
</I>&gt;<i> possible.  I would say isLoaded() is the only one really necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;maybe a driver should plug into a device (setDriver(Driver d)) or can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;there be more than one driver at a time?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was pondering the other direction: MyDriver.setDevice( Device d ) so that
</I>&gt;<i> multiple drivers can use a single device.  Here's where Device.veto() would
</I>&gt;<i> come in handy, to prevent its use.  This would allow real-time upgrades to a
</I>&gt;<i> better Driver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip Driver.java&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the same goes for this with the getDescription() and all...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> getDescription would be a human-readable string to indicate the operation of
</I>&gt;<i> the Driver.  We could use this method as well in the Device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;speaking of descriptions, whats this a driver for? how about: Device
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;getDevice()?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;some state info for this would be good too, like hasControlOfDevice()
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good points.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;You should also have an abstract DeviceAdaptor and DriverAdaptor for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;faster impl.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You mean like java.awt.WindowAdapter which is a concrete class
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of java.awt.WindowListener?  Good idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
