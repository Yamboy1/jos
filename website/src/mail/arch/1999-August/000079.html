<PRE>When we build JOS on top of Java, we are building a very high-level third
generation system. It is fully object-oriented. It is powerful. But, it is
still third generation because it uses the lines-of-code model to build
programs. It is still third generation because it uses a separate step to
compile bytecode.

Sure, we need more third generation compilers. We need javac-like tools to
build bytecode from many programming languages. This is not &quot;generic
scripting&quot;.

Generic scripting is supposed to be interpreted. That's the point. A
generic scripting interface should support all kinds of interpreters. These
interpreters do not need a separate step to compile bytecode. Many
scripting languages use a plain-text file as a container for statements.
Like Linux, the first &quot;statment&quot; in a source code file should be the name
(alias) of its interpreter.

On the other hand, we can build a mid-level fourth generation system by
combining the bean property inspector, registry-based persistence, and a
generic scripting interface. A bean property inspector allows a interaction
between an end-user and their component configuration. Registry-base
persistence makes it possible to swap compatible components in a very
flexible manner. The generic scripting interface should not be another
version of Java.

A mid-level fourth generation language provide mechanisms for configuring
visual and non-visual components. It provides a non-programming view of an
application. Configuration is non-sequential. Designing visual components
is non-sequential.

For a sequential &quot;procedure&quot;, a fourth generation language must provide
fill-out-a-form approach. Each &quot;statement&quot; in a program is a registry node.
There are zero or more &quot;parameters&quot; to each statement, or properties of a
node.

A cousin of the registry editor lets you paste together your own
&quot;procedures&quot;. This is pre-programmed with one form for each method. That's
a lot of forms, right? Using a bean property inspector, each form is
generated on-the-fly. The forms are not stored as bytecode. They are stored
as registry nodes inside a large registry.

One of the problems with fourth generation languages is the problem of too
many user-defined types. In order to fully support a fourth generation
language, the mechanism must embrace all user-defined types. Additional
forms are added as a &quot;procedure&quot; has &quot;parameters&quot;.

How does JOS support user-defined types? A user-defined type can be passed
as a parameter to a procedure by URI. You type in the stringified name of a
digital resource. The SmartAPI makes it easy to pass any object to a
procedure by reference. That's why the SmartAPI and registry are important
to me.

This is a big opportunity for the JOS community. Only a few have ventured
this far into the fourth generation. When we write JOS tools in a fourth
generation &quot;language&quot;, it only takes a few people to write the whole OS.
