Thanks. Your examples prove the point I was trying to make. I must clarify
what I said about &quot;inheriting&quot; static methods. I mean to say that &quot;static
main()&quot; does not provide the behavior you might expect.

When you type java test3 on the command line, you might expect it to run
test3; but, it doesn't. It runs test1. test1 should have been able to
insist that test2 and test3 override its static main().

By the way, test3 becomes only an &quot;alias&quot; for test1.

&gt;<i>arguably, you could do this currently if you dont mind creating another
</I>&gt;<i>JVM
</I>
I don't want another JVM as much as I want a new OS. I don't want another
JVM as much as I want a multiple-JVM java tool.

&gt;&gt;<i> Since applications, applets, servlets and aglets are different kinds of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;programs&quot;, it becomes possible to unify all programs under a program API.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A program browser would provide a host environment for running (and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> debugging!) all kinds of programs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>this would only be internal, right? I mean you have the program
</I>&gt;<i>interface then you have an ApplicationProgram that runs a java app as a
</I>&gt;<i>program or a ServletProgram, so that all programs can be handled the
</I>&gt;<i>same way internally; and still allow for the prospect of someone making
</I>&gt;<i>his app a program or use programs as plugins or whatever...
</I>
Internal? No, I don't think so. All &quot;programs&quot; can be handled the same way.

ApplicationProgram? That's exactly right. Using the reflection API, a
single implementation of Program is ApplicationProgram. It can run any
traditional Java &quot;application&quot; that declares a public static main( String[]
) method.

Using the strong servlet model, we need an implementation of Program called
ServletProgram, so that all servlets are automatically compatible with
Program and ProgramContext.

For application programmers that want to implement Program directly, they
can quickly build programs with full support for inheritence.

&gt;&gt;<i> It would be a bad thing if your shell launches a sub-program that calls
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> System.exit() with a result code. Your shell would end prematurely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The Security manager would deny that request in a properly designed
</I>&gt;<i>shell, or it would simply run the app in its own process
</I>
Programs, with their own ProgramContext, do not have to be sandboxed. The
security manager should not get in the way. Neither an &quot;application&quot; nor
&quot;program&quot; should run inside a sandbox. When you write a program, you should
not call System.exit() unless you want to close the shell.

&gt;&gt;<i> It would be a bad thing for your servlet to call System.exit() with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> result code. It would end the servlet enviroment prematurely. Servlets are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expected to use an &quot;honor system&quot; among serlet programmers, instead of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> security system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I was under the impression that servlets were sandboxed when it came to
</I>&gt;<i>stuff like that
</I>
Servlets work because they were not sandboxed. Servlets run just like a
Java application. Your servlet has access to JDBC, ODBC, sockets, threads,
class loaders--you name it.

I very much prefer to run my servlets on the client-side. The servletrunner
tool runs on all clients with no problem. That sure makes it easier to
distribute the processing load of a large distributed application.

&gt;<i>but it would support legacy by saying &quot;oh, this is an Applet that doesnt
</I>&gt;<i>implemtn Program, Ill use the AppletProgram class to proxy and load
</I>&gt;<i>it...&quot;
</I>
Exactly! Program and ProgramContext is just a start. It provides a way to
make JOS backward- and forward-compatible.

&gt;<i>package digigod.apps;
</I>&gt;<i>public abstract class Application {
</I>&gt;<i>}
</I>
There is a difference between your Application and mine. My Application is
an interface, not abstract class. It must be an interface because any class
can act like an application. Any class can implement my Application
interface, even an applet or Java Bean. It looks something like this:

public interface Application
    extends Runnable {
  public Console getConsole();
  public void setConsole( Console v );
}

That's it. Since an &quot;application&quot; is expected to never fail, there is no
result code. Since my &quot;applications&quot; never expect parameters, no parameters
are passed. There is no equivalent application context.

This interface has served me very well. I type in the name of an
application and my application browser runs it. There is a little more to
my Application interface because I have a Console interface that's
preferrable to standard out:

public interface Console {
  public void println( String v );
}

I have developed many implementations of Console over time. An application
is not expected to set its own console; the application environment
provides one.
