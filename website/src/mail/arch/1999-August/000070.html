<PRE>JOS needs a GSI (or something similiar) to be truly flexible, but what
goes into it?

I think we could have two abstract classes, a ScriptLoader class that
acts like a ClassLoader, except it creates Script objects.

ScriptLoader would be given the data and it would parse the script or
load the bytecode (or decide which to do in some cases) Im guessing
parsing would be handled sepreatley, but thats up to the implementation.
the Script would be an abstract super class encapsulating the Script, it
would probably have an abstract method interpret() or someting like it.

most Scripting languages let you create language elements in the host
language, here we would have an interface Scriptable with the method
ScriptInfo getScriptInfo(), ScriptInfo would be just like BeanInfo, it
would be up to the language how to handle these of course.

this is just a basic outline of what we need, I think we should work on
this. what else do we need? how would we do it? how have others done it? 

we need to make it as flexible as possible, allowing scripts to be run
as applications and in applications in a standard way so they dont even
have to be aware of the language being used. we also need to make it
easy to make proxy support for all the scripting languages that already
have Java libraries
(<A HREF="http://grunge.cs.tu-berlin.de/~tolk/vmlanguages.html">http://grunge.cs.tu-berlin.de/~tolk/vmlanguages.html</A>). it should handle
interpreted and compiled scripts the same.

any thoughts?

Cheers,
DigiGod
