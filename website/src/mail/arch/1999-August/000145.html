&gt;<i>Actually, can you tell me the context of your definition?
</I>
JOS is expected to run all kinds of programs. In theory, a uniform API for
all kinds programs is possible. This is what we're working toward.

We should learn from the success and failures of other operating systems.
Each new operating system has a brief opportunity to challenge the
assumptions of traditional data processing models. JOS must fortify the
strengths and minimize the weaknesses of all operating systems that have
gone before.

Are Java Beans the best model of batch data processing? What are the
implications of running non-inherited static main()? Why are there separate
models for Java applications, Java applets, Java servlets and Java aglets?
Aren't all of these trying to do exactly the same thing?

JOS is not UNIX(tm). JOS is not TSO(tm) or OS/400(tm). JOS is not Microsoft
Windows(tm) or MS-DOS(tm). JOS is not Linux. JOS is not Java(tm). So, what
is it? That's what we're trying to figure out.

&gt;<i>I always thought of a program as something with a main() method.
</I>
An &quot;Java application&quot; is a kind-of program. It is defined as any class with
a static main() method. While an &quot;application&quot; is always a program, a
program is not always an &quot;application&quot;. An application is a self-contained,
independent program. A result code is irrelevant for an &quot;application&quot;
because it is never expected to &quot;fail&quot;.

While the &quot;Java applet&quot; is a strong model for a program, an &quot;application&quot;
is not. What is wrong with static main()? Since a static method cannot be
inherited, an application cannot inherit the main() behavior of its
superclass.

Also, the static main() is declared as void. When one application launches
another, a result code is not expected or desired. That's the nature of
applications.

On the other hand, a result code is critical when a program runs a
sub-program. It is the nature of programs. If applications are used where
programs are required, there is no result code.

&gt;<i>Now, my program (with it's main method n'all), can:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1. get parameters from the argument list of the main() method.
</I>&gt;<i>2. get environment parameters from System.getProperties()
</I>&gt;<i>3. exit with a result code using System.exit(code)
</I>
Yes, Java provides the perfect environment for applications. The
application context is java.lang.System and java.lang.Runtime. An
application is all alone inside a JVM, and should be.

This is a hostile environment for programs. Each program must have its own
unique context. Programs cannot share java.lang.System and
java.lang.Runtime because each program has its own unique set of
parameters. Each has its own unique result code.

This model enables a program to use another program within a single JVM,
without resorting to the Runtime/Process model. We retain the benefit of
knowing when a program's result code.

Since applications, applets, servlets and aglets are different kinds of
&quot;programs&quot;, it becomes possible to unify all programs under a program API.
A program browser would provide a host environment for running (and
debugging!) all kinds of programs.

&gt;&gt;<i> A program is not a process. It does not have its own System.in, System.out,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and System.err. It is a well-defined interface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Ok, I think this suggests (a lot of guess work here) that the use of
</I>&gt;<i>this Program interface is where a program wants to interact with a
</I>&gt;<i>number of other programs to achieve a goal, all in a single process
</I>&gt;<i>(optional).
</I>
Traditional runtime code reuse has always started with the program model.
You can build many little programs, like UNIX(tm) and all other operating
systems, an combine them with scripts (and batch files). Since JOS needs a
program model and Java API doesn't have one, we thought we'd create it.

It would be a bad thing if your shell launches a sub-program that calls
System.exit() with a result code. Your shell would end prematurely.

The make tool demonstrates the need for a program model. The make tool's
purpose is to run sub-programs based on simple rules. It is critical to the
make tool to &quot;know&quot; when a sub-program failed. When a sub-program fails,
the whole make fails.

It would be a bad thing if the make tool launches a sub-program that calls
System.exit() with a result code. A make script would end prematurely.

It would be a bad thing for your servlet to call System.exit() with a
result code. It would end the servlet enviroment prematurely. Servlets are
expected to use an &quot;honor system&quot; among serlet programmers, instead of a
security system.

&gt;<i>The concept of the main() method (and therefore, your Program interface
</I>&gt;<i>too) is very primitive.
</I>
Exactly. A minimal interface is our goal. We are trying to reduce a program
down to its barest essentials. We are not adding the complexity of multiple
threads or multiple independent processes.

&gt;<i>If you would like to achieve a higher goal by linking together several
</I>&gt;<i>programs, the main/run() method is a very limiting solution to the problem.
</I>&gt;<i>UNIX is about as good as it gets (UNIX consists of lots of little programs
</I>&gt;<i>cooperating with each other by calling each other's main() methods. The shell
</I>&gt;<i>orchestrates this with pipes and redirection symbols.
</I>
UNIX(tm) is as good as it gets. The reason it exists on UNIX(tm) is simply
because it is needed. The classic data processing model has been expanded
beyond UNIX(tm). It is available on every major operating system, except Java.

&gt;<i>With the advent of Java, piping and main() arguments seem unintuitive.
</I>
Sun Microsystems insists that an instance of the JVM must be created for
each application. The JVM still support piping and a result code on the
outside. The native OS can still redirect standard in, standard out and
standard err. The result code passed to System.exit() is returned to the
native OS.

The benefit of the program model have not been passed on to your Java code.
It would be very difficult to get &quot;public static int main( String[] args )&quot;
to work anyway.

&gt;<i>Instead we could have JavaBeans interacting with each other.
</I>
Sure. I supposed you could have JavaBeans acting like programs without a
well-defined program interface. Each bean might have a different interface.
Parameters for a program could be thought of as properties of a bean. The
result code from a bean would be the return value of some method.

This program and program context model provides a way to use JavaBeans as
if they were programs. A well-defined interface is used instead of
reflection. And class, even a bean, can implement the program interface.

More importantly, this gives us a unified model for JOS programs. When you
want to run a program from a shell, the shell can check for a program
interface. The shell can run many programs, properly, with result codes,
within a single JVM.

Further, we bring back the power of shell scripting. When the shell runs a
shell script, it can return the result code of every program it runs. The
shell script can handle non-zero result codes.

Plus, the shell can launch a program in a separate thread or a separate
process.

&gt;<i>Given JavaBeans and (standard) programs, do we really need a third
</I>&gt;<i>option?
</I>
We have Java &quot;applications&quot;, &quot;applets&quot;, &quot;servlets&quot;, &quot;aglets&quot;, &quot;browslets&quot;,
&quot;pluglets&quot; and &quot;jarlets&quot;. We have beans, too. All these things are
different kinds of programs. Instead of having a separate (incompatible)
interface for each speciality, there are benefits to bringing them together.
