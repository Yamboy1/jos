I agree, I made my class because Id rather do it that way, I think
gilbert made his because he likes to do it that way. my class runs as a
regluar app, gilberts needs a runner. ones not better then the other,
they're different you could even use both. I think gilbert wrote his to
make a way for his browser to abstract everything uniformly, but Im not
sure. I made mine because I program that way.

I have small main's too, I dont like having them in my objects though;
it creeps me out. I like having a class called Main thats basically a
batch file to run my stuff, this is a easy way to make that even
smaller. If I make an Applet that can run standalone I include a Main
that creates an applet context and a Frame and all that to run it, I
dont think that belongs in my Applet since its not an Applet or an
application at that point.

I agree that it should be more like a library, Im decoupling the command
line parsing from my class so it can be reused even in non
Appplication's. Ill post that when I finish it.

Cheers,
DigiGod

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
