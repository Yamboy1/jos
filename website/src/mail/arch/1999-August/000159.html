<PRE>This email is in reply to DigiGod's comment that servlets and applets
can still be run from the command-line with servletrunner and
appletviewer.

I am quite aware of this :-) But that misses my point. An applet is a
generic piece of code that can be embedded into many different container
environments for different purposes. To use an applet in any particular
instance, the environment must be set up before hand. This environment
might consist of a web page that contains other applets that the main
applet interacts with. It may depend on being contained in a web page
that has two frames, one frame containing the applet, the other frame
being controlled by the applet with showDocument. For example, a menu
applet might showDocument() in the other frame when you click on one of
its buttons.

AppletViewer is able to load applets but it is mainly for testing. You
can't possibly make use of the menu applet from the command-line. It is
only useful in a web page.

While the output of a command-line tool is directed back to the
command-line or to the local filesystem, the output of an Applet is
directed to an entirely different environment that lives in another
dimension to the command-line.

In the same way, the output of a servlet is directed to a completely
different environment. You can't &quot;use&quot; a servlet from the command-line,
you can only use it through the servlet interface because that is the
environment it was designed to take advantage of.

servletrunner and appletviewer are both programs that you can use from
the command-line, but servlets and applets are programs that can only be
&quot;used&quot; within certain contexts.
