<PRE>&gt;<i> what if we want to make our java object an element in the script though?
</I>&gt;<i> like an add-on library, say we have a LuaMathLib object that has X math
</I>&gt;<i> methods that we want to map into the Lua interpreter as X fucntions...
</I>&gt;<i> how would we handle that? 
</I>
	Not through getScriptInfo(), because that returns information on
the script, and not on the (extended) interperter on which it runs.


&gt;<i> my purpose in defining the Element top-level class was to allow a java
</I>&gt;<i> program to use parts of the script; say we have a reinit() function in
</I>&gt;<i> our script that we need to call... we get the Element for it to use
</I>&gt;<i> it... but what does Element look like?
</I>
	Okay, this makes a lot of sense.  Why not make Element an
interface implemented by java.lang.Reflect.* inheriting subclasses?  i.e.:

public class tclMethod extends Method implements jos.gsi.Element {}

&gt;<i> ok, when does the interpreter start and when does the script start? if
</I>&gt;<i> we have BOB (which is a C/C++ish type script) which has a main like C,
</I>&gt;<i> does the interpreter start the script when its loaded by calling main,
</I>&gt;<i> or does it wait until we tell it to start? what if its a library you
</I>&gt;<i> created to make programming your app easier and doesnt have a main as
</I>&gt;<i> its just a collection of functions... does it return a
</I>&gt;<i> NotARunnableScriptEvent?
</I>
	I think the ability to select when the script runs is necessary.
If we adapt the event model I've described, then generating a ScriptStart
(or whatever) event will start the script in an interperter-independent
way.  Likewise, event-triggered scripts would become 'active' on a
ScriptStart event.  Libraries are hard, but I think if you generate a
ScriptStart event, then it should be the interperter's/script's choice to
ignore it if it's inappropriate or throw an exception.


	Basically, I'm imagining a system where an object like
'jos.gsi.ScriptManager mySM' functions as a clearing-house for
jos.gsi.Script objects, so that the application can do something like:

init() {
	appMainFrame.addKeyboardListener( mySM );
	appMainFrame.addMouseListener( mySM );
	appMainFrame.addFocusListener( mySM );
	}

and the ScriptManager would handle throwing the different events at the
different scripts, so that appMainFrame suddenly becomes a scripted
object.  Something like

	appMainFrame.addURLListener( mySM );

	could be achieved by subclassing ScriptManager to implement the
URLListener interface.  (Where one would do something like:

for ( int i = 0; i &lt; myScripts.size(); i++ ) {
	switch URLEvent.getType() {
		case FTP:
			try { myScripts.elementAt(i).runMethod( &quot;FTP&quot; ); }
			catch ( NoSuchMethodException nsme ) {
				/* if every element of myScripts fails,
				   throw a NoSuchMethodException... */
				}
			break;
/* etc. */

	would be the body of the URLListener methods.)
