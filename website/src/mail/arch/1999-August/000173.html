</I>&gt;<i> I am quite aware of this :-) But that misses my point. An applet is a
</I>&gt;<i> generic piece of code that can be embedded into many different container
</I>&gt;<i> environments for different purposes. To use an applet in any particular
</I>&gt;<i> instance, the environment must be set up before hand. This environment
</I>&gt;<i> might consist of a web page that contains other applets that the main
</I>&gt;<i> applet interacts with. It may depend on being contained in a web page
</I>&gt;<i> that has two frames, one frame containing the applet, the other frame
</I>&gt;<i> being controlled by the applet with showDocument. For example, a menu
</I>&gt;<i> applet might showDocument() in the other frame when you click on one of
</I>&gt;<i> its buttons.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> AppletViewer is able to load applets but it is mainly for testing. You
</I>&gt;<i> can't possibly make use of the menu applet from the command-line. It is
</I>&gt;<i> only useful in a web page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While the output of a command-line tool is directed back to the
</I>&gt;<i> command-line or to the local filesystem, the output of an Applet is
</I>&gt;<i> directed to an entirely different environment that lives in another
</I>&gt;<i> dimension to the command-line.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the same way, the output of a servlet is directed to a completely
</I>&gt;<i> different environment. You can't &quot;use&quot; a servlet from the command-line,
</I>&gt;<i> you can only use it through the servlet interface because that is the
</I>&gt;<i> environment it was designed to take advantage of.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> servletrunner and appletviewer are both programs that you can use from
</I>&gt;<i> the command-line, but servlets and applets are programs that can only be
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;used&quot; within certain contexts.

I was trying to reinforce Gilberts point (or what I understand of it)
that all this is just to provide a uniform testing/demoing enviroment...

Cheers,

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
