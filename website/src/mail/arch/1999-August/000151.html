No, and this is why I cannot understand your goal.

Applications, applets and servlets are each used in entirely different
situations, hence they have different interfaces that reflect how they
are used:

- A servlet can only be run from within a servlet engine because it
relies on a very unique environment. For example, an HTTP servlet relies
on the fact that it can access various information in the HTTP header of
a request. It relies on the fact that its instance can persist between
invocations, so it can keep a database connection open (for example).
Both of these dependencies bar servlets from being invoked in a uniform
manner with other types of programs. For example, you just can't run a
servlet from the command-line. It doesn't make any sense.

- An applet is also very different from a command-line program. The key
quality of an Applet is that it is a part of a larger entity. It
requires this entity to be useful. An applet cannot be executed unless
it is in a web page. The applet is very aware that it is in a web page.
It can read its applet parameters which are defined in the web page, it
can communicate with other applets that are in the web page, it can even
make another web page load. Because of its different nature, it can't be
treated in a similar way to applications or servlets. Another point is
that you don't really invoke an applet (as you do with the programs you
speak of), you &quot;embed&quot; it in an application specific way that is
provided by the applet itself.

- Applications (both gui and command-line) are intended to be invoked.
Applications are a unique type of program that are designed to carry out
a task and return to the shell, or carry out tasks given through a user
interface until the user wishes to exit the application. These types of
programs are the only programs that are suitable for shells because they
can be invoked, they have a clearly defined lifespan, and a definite way
of returning to the shell.

&gt;<i> A result code is irrelevant for an &quot;application&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> because it is never expected to &quot;fail&quot;.
</I>
I agree. There is definately a distinction between applications and
command-line tools, even though Sun decided to invoke both types through
the same unified interface - the main() method. However, I think they
realised that the unification could not extend beyond applications and
command-line tools. So, applets and servlets are &quot;used&quot; through a
different interface that caters for their use.

&gt;<i> While the &quot;Java applet&quot; is a strong model for a program, an &quot;application&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> is not. What is wrong with static main()? Since a static method cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> inherited, an application cannot inherit the main() behavior of its
</I>&gt;<i> superclass.
</I>
main() typically does not have any behaviour to inherit. It should fire
up a reusable object and let it handle the rest of the processing. Any
behaviour you put in to main() is not reusable from an OO perspective so
it is wise to pass control into reusable objects as soon as possible.

&gt;<i> This model enables a program to use another program within a single JVM,
</I>&gt;<i> without resorting to the Runtime/Process model. We retain the benefit of
</I>&gt;<i> knowing when a program's result code.
</I>--snip--
&gt;<i> It would be a bad thing if your shell launches a sub-program that calls
</I>&gt;<i> System.exit() with a result code. Your shell would end prematurely.
</I>
What you don't realise is that none of these problems exist in the
current system. Just because System.exit() is the only way to return a
result code doesn't mean that Java can't use this returned value. When
you call Runtime.exec() it returns a Process object. You can wait for
the process to exit and then query it for its result code.

Secondly, just because you are using Runtime.exec() doesn't mean that
you are starting up a whole new JVM. It simply means you are starting up
a new process. This is how UNIX works. We can implement it the same way
with a modified JVM that can spawn new processes in a lightweight
manner. You mentioned that Sun insists that we don't do this. Well who
cares what Sun say. It is obviously possible.

Your wish to have sub-programs running in the same process is a
dangerous approach. Even if you provide an alternate mechnism for
returning result codes, System.exit() is still there and used by nearly
every Java application in existence today. If a sub-program calls this,
your shell will also die, along with other sub-programs in the same
process. That is, unless you stick with the current program model where
you spawn new processes with the Runtime class (same way as UNIX). If
you impose a SecurityManager on programs which choose to call
System.exit(), they will crash. Only new programs written to your API
will work and I somehow don't think many people will want to switch.

&gt;<i> More importantly, this gives us a unified model for JOS programs. When you
</I>&gt;<i> want to run a program from a shell, the shell can check for a program
</I>&gt;<i> interface. The shell can run many programs, properly, with result codes,
</I>&gt;<i> within a single JVM.
</I>
Refer to my points about this at the beginning of this email.

Ok, this one I saved 'till last:

&gt;<i> Since applications, applets, servlets and aglets are different kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;programs&quot;, it becomes possible to unify all programs under a program API.
</I>&gt;<i> A program browser would provide a host environment for running (and
</I>&gt;<i> debugging!) all kinds of programs.
</I>
Not surprisingly, I am interested in the use of what you are proposing.
Debugging was something that caught my eye. I don't yet understand how a
unified API is useful for debugging, but if you can explain it to me,
there might be a use for this unified API after all.
