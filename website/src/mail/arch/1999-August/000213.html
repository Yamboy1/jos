Right! I meant *at the very least* every part of JOS should be free for
personal use. Much of the code is GPL'ed or LGPL'd and it should be.

&gt;<i>Right. But &quot;a little extra&quot; mustn't translate to $40 or something, as is the
</I>&gt;<i>case with FreeBSD. Something like $5 on the other hand would be more
</I>&gt;<i>affordable.

In a free market, &quot;a little extra&quot; is determined by supply and demand. It
makes sense to price the JOS distribution within comparable products. If
you can buy a complete OS for $25, how much should you pay for a pre-alpha
OS? In fact, it will cost *more* to publish CDs in small quantities.

How do we keep the cost low? We give distributors a free license to
distribute JOS. Any &quot;improvements&quot; made by distributors must be returned to
the JOS Project. The free license reduces the cost to a distributor. The
savings are passed on to their customers.

&gt;<i>In any case; will the JOS project handle disttribution anyway? Wouldn't it
</I>&gt;<i>be a better idea to simply have a 3rd party ditribute &quot;official&quot; CDs, as is
</I>&gt;<i>the case with Debian GNU/Linux for example?
</I>
I believe the JOS Project should build relationships with Caldera, Red Hat,
Slackware, SuSE and others. Distributors add value to JOS by testing,
selecting packages, writing documentation and building a distribution. The
JOS Project should concentrate on making JOS.

And, these distributors are not *required* to give money to the JOS Project
under the terms of GPL/LGPL. It is an honor system. Distributors are asked
to send money to the JOS Project when JOS is a successful product. The JOS
Project doesn't seem to have that much of an operating budget anyway.
