</I>&gt;<i> I'll try to answer it below)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using your method above, a mouse device would need to set the event, then

</I>&gt;<i> applications, where the drivers can execute their mouse event in their own
</I>&gt;<i> thread.  I don't know if you remember the discussion on the Kernel list when
</I>&gt;<i> we were trying to figure out how to handle Interrupts.  Originally, IRQ
</I>&gt;<i> listeners would do a:
</I>&gt;<i>        synchronized( interrupt12 ) {
</I>&gt;<i>           interrupt12.wait();
</I>&gt;<i>        }
</I>&gt;<i> And they would wake up when the interrupt occured.  The problem was that
</I>&gt;<i> (with the keyboard), this routine quickly encountered a deadlock.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The alternate method is to have the &quot;wait queue&quot;, which is a event queue
</I>&gt;<i> where the queue performs a wait if it is empty on a request to retrieve the
</I>&gt;<i> next element.  This is probably the way to go in a device/driver interface.
</I>&gt;<i> The wait queue would be a shared object between the device and the driver.
</I>&gt;<i> The device would need to keep one queue per registered driver, if multiple
</I>&gt;<i> driver registration is supported.
</I>
sounds good
 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; hasDriver() *may* be appropriate for many devices (like HardDrive
</I>&gt;<i> device - I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; wouldn't like multiple drivers, unaware of each other, messing around at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; low-level at the same time, but I don't care how many drivers listen to
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; MouseDevice).  isLoaded(), I feel, may be a reiterative method: if the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Driver can find the device, it has been loaded.  Or maybe I'm not seeing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; something with this.  I dunno.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;hasDriver could throw OperationUnsupportedException or it could be in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;UniDriver interface (horrid name, but you get the idea).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm crossed on this.  If we could implement both at the same time, I'd be
</I>&gt;<i> happy 8-)
</I>
this is what I proposed:

 public void setDriver(Driver d);
 public Driver getDriver();
 public boolean hasDriver();

but maybe this is more general:

 public void addDriver(Driver d);
 public void removeDriver(Driver d);
 public boolean hasDriver(Driver d);
 public boolean noDrivers(); // true if there are 0 drivers
 
&gt;<i> Hot-swappable devices?  I thought that JavaOS did a good job with this.
</I>&gt;<i> When a device was disconnected, it sent an event to all listening drivers to
</I>&gt;<i> say, &quot;Hey, I'm gone.  You're on your own.&quot;  The drivers then figure out how
</I>&gt;<i> to handle this problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this way, devices are not in the system for registration purposes.  There
</I>&gt;<i> is a problem with this in the way of Java's garbage collection, but, again,
</I>&gt;<i> JavaOS handled it well.  I won't go into detail how they did it, unless you
</I>&gt;<i> *really* want me to.
</I>
I like this
 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;you should have a getDescription() and a getHRName(), if you make a tree
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;of all of them you need getHRName for the name on the tree node, PNP6000
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;(or whatever) will hardly make sense to the average person.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;or better yet getName() is the HR one and you have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;get[Device|Driver]Name() for the ID
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Great.  After typing those enormous class names above, I'll believe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; anything.  But really, that sounds like the way to go.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;be easier for creating a visual device tree at the very least...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds useful.  Let's do it.
</I>
lets do it.

Cheers,

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
