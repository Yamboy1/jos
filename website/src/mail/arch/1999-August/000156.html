You are correct. Applications, applets and servlets are used in different
environments today. That is going change. We, members of the JOS Project,
should anticipate this change, embracing it.

It has been difficult for Sun Microsystems and others to see how much all
these programs have in common. All of these run Java bytecode inside a JVM.
That means that all of these have more in common than it may at first appear.

&gt;<i>- A servlet can only be run from within a servlet engine because it
</I>&gt;<i>relies on a very unique environment. For example, an HTTP servlet relies
</I>&gt;<i>on the fact that it can access various information in the HTTP header of
</I>&gt;<i>a request. It relies on the fact that its instance can persist between
</I>&gt;<i>invocations, so it can keep a database connection open (for example).
</I>&gt;<i>Both of these dependencies bar servlets from being invoked in a uniform
</I>&gt;<i>manner with other types of programs. For example, you just can't run a
</I>&gt;<i>servlet from the command-line. It doesn't make any sense.
</I>
Yes, well, sort of. Servlets run inside a servlet engine. Sun provides a
servletrunner, so you don't have to have a separate HTTP service.

Warning: This information might be shocking to all those who follow Sun
Microsystems wherever they go. Sun's website very clearly states that this
can't be done.

First, you run servlets from a command line. When I run this command from
my HTML browser, or rather its location field, it invokes a servlet. The
location field is-a command line.

<A HREF="http://localhost:8080/servlet/org.jos.demo.DemoServlet">http://localhost:8080/servlet/org.jos.demo.DemoServlet</A>

Second, servlets are based exclusively on *streams*, not TCP/IP. A
servletrunner provides ServletInputStreams and ServletOutputStream to a
servlet, so that a servlet doesn't need to know about TCP/IP connections.
There are no dependencies that prevent servlets from running elsewhere.
There is no need for a servlet engine to use TCP/IP--even for HTTP servlets.

Your servlet get HTTP header information from a ServletInputStream. It
writes HTTP header information to a ServletOutputStream. It doesn't need to
connect with a requestor using a TCP/IP connection.

Why would anyone want to? As a Java programmer, I need to build servlets in
the shortest amount of time possible. Debugging a servlet *inside* the
servletrunner is less than optimum for debugging servlets. You can set
break-points inside your servlet code. Yes, you can even create debugging
frames and dialog boxes (only used during testing). I would rather debug my
servlets in a plain-text browser. Hey, that's what I'm doing.

In the location field of my plain-text browser, I type the following URI:

x-servlet:org.jos.demo.DemoServlet

My plain-text browser will provide a servlet environment completely free of
TCP/IP connections. It will load and run any servlet, just like the servlet
specification says. The output from the servlet is displayed in plain text,
so that I can look at the raw HTML, to make sure the servlet produces the
HTML code that I want it to. It will be fast. It will be direct. My
plain-text browser will be easy to restart (with a restart button) so that
I can recompile my servlet frequently and start a new &quot;session&quot; whenever I
want.

After I get the servlet working, then I move to a more complicated
environment, using an HTML browser, a servletrunner tool, and TCP/IP.

x-servlet:org.jos.demo.DemoServlet

is equivalent to

<A HREF="http://localhost:8080/servlet/org.jos.demo.DemoServlet">http://localhost:8080/servlet/org.jos.demo.DemoServlet</A>

Parameters are passed with a standard query string. I can quickly test
different combinations of parameters and instantly see the results. When I
pause a servlet right in the middle of building an HTML file, I see all
output that has been written so far.

Sidebar: You can run servlets on the client-side. Every machine that has a
JVM is capable of being a &quot;server&quot;. If you integrate servletrunner into
your client-side Java application, you can run servlets on the client-side.
Sounds strange only because Sun mis-named them &quot;servlets&quot;, giving everyone
the mistaken impression that they only run on the server-side.

&gt;<i>- An applet is also very different from a command-line program. The key
</I>&gt;<i>quality of an Applet is that it is a part of a larger entity. It
</I>&gt;<i>requires this entity to be useful. An applet cannot be executed unless
</I>&gt;<i>it is in a web page. The applet is very aware that it is in a web page.
</I>&gt;<i>It can read its applet parameters which are defined in the web page, it
</I>&gt;<i>can communicate with other applets that are in the web page, it can even
</I>&gt;<i>make another web page load. Because of its different nature, it can't be
</I>&gt;<i>treated in a similar way to applications or servlets. Another point is
</I>&gt;<i>that you don't really invoke an applet (as you do with the programs you
</I>&gt;<i>speak of), you &quot;embed&quot; it in an application specific way that is
</I>&gt;<i>provided by the applet itself.
</I>
Yes, well, sort of. Applets run inside an applet engine. Sun provides a
appletrunner, so you don't have to have a separate HTML browser.

First, you can definitely run applets outside a browser. You can run the
appletrunner, right?

Second, you can definitely run applets without HTML. This might be a
surprise to all those who use Sun's brain-dead appletrunner tool. But, it
is no surprise to those using JavaBee. Check out the wonderful JavaBee
product at &lt;URL:<A HREF="http://www.javabee.com/">http://www.javabee.com/</A>&gt;.

My applet browser provides a simple way to run applets with support for
parameters. In the location field of my applet browser, I type the
following URI:

x-applet:org.jos.demo.DemoApplet

My applet browser provides an applet environment completely free of HTML.
It loads and runs an applet, just like the applet specification says. The
output from the applet is displayed in a frame, so that I reside the applet
and interact with its visual components, to make sure the applet behaves
the way I want it to. It is fast. It is direct. My applet browser is easy
to restart (with a restart button) so that I can recompile my applet
frequently. I invoke an applet with exactly the same mechanism as I invoke
a servlet.

Parameters are passed with a standard query string. I can test different
combinations of parameters. Feedback is immediate. No bulky HTML browser is
required.

My applet browser supports the showDocument() and showStatus() methods
required by the applet environment. The showDocument() method overwrites
the location field with a new URI, but does not automatically run it. I can
look at the output from showDocument() to see if looks right.

Then, I move up to embedding an applet on an HTML page.

&gt;<i>- Applications (both gui and command-line) are intended to be invoked.
</I>&gt;<i>Applications are a unique type of program that are designed to carry out
</I>&gt;<i>a task and return to the shell, or carry out tasks given through a user
</I>&gt;<i>interface until the user wishes to exit the application. These types of
</I>&gt;<i>programs are the only programs that are suitable for shells because they
</I>&gt;<i>can be invoked, they have a clearly defined lifespan, and a definite way
</I>&gt;<i>of returning to the shell.
</I>
Exactly! Applications &quot;carry out tasks given through a user interface until
the user wishes to exit the application.&quot; That's a key difference between
&quot;applications&quot; and &quot;programs&quot;.

My program browser--you guessed it--runs programs. It provides a simple way
to run programs with full support for parameters. In the location field of
my program browser, I type the following URI:

x-program:org.jos.demo.DemoProgram

The standard output from the DemoProgram is display just like the
plain-text browser.

&gt;<i>Not surprisingly, I am interested in the use of what you are proposing.
</I>&gt;<i>Debugging was something that caught my eye. I don't yet understand how a
</I>&gt;<i>unified API is useful for debugging, but if you can explain it to me,
</I>&gt;<i>there might be a use for this unified API after all.
</I>
In the end, I wish to combine all specialized browsers into a unified JOS
browser. Here is what you'll be able to debug and demonstrate within a
single application:

Protocol - Program Type - Status

run:os: - native OS processes - complete
run:jose: - José applications - complete
multi - (file:, http:, x-registry:, in:*, out:*) - complete
x-applet: - Java applets - almost complete
x-archive - JOS archive browser (.cab, .gz, .jar, .zip) - not started yet
x-servlet: - Java servlets - needs more work
x-program: - JOS programs - needs more work
x-aglet: - Java aglets - not started yet

What does this mean? It means that you can build a servlet that dynamically
creates an HTML index of all your applications, applets, programs, native
programs, archives, and other servlets. You click on the digital resource
you want to invoke. Ta-da! You get one.

Do you want it all? You can have it all. You can mix and match until you
get dizzy and your head hurts. We live in a brave new world where programs
are multiply connected.

- You can download and run Java bytecode from anywhere (if that's what you
really want).
- You can build a program that runs as a program...and a servlet.
- You can build a Java application that runs as a Java application...or a
program or servlet.
- You can build an applet that runs as an applet...and a program.
- You can run a servlet that runs as a servlet...and a program.
- You can run a native program as a native program...and a servlet.
- Your aglet can roam around and bring back its search results as a
program, applet, or servlet.

- It is recursive, too. So that you can launch an applet that starts a
program that uses servlets that use native programs. You can do anything
you want.

As an operating system, JOS should take advantage of some of the
combinations that make the most sense. For example, the ls command should
be available as a program, a Java application, and a servlet. When you
invoke the ls command from within your HTML browser, the results should be
returned as (1) plain-text or (2) full HTML code. Here is where program
inheritence becomes critically important.

We should have a plain-text ls program. The HTML version of the ls program
should extend the plain-text version. Both have identical functionality.
While one runs as a program or Java application, the other runs as a
servlet. You can browse around your JOS OS file subsystem using your HTML
browser on a local machine or across the Internet.

We can be compatible with other names for ls. The dir command can use the
ls program. The dir command takes much different command line parameters
than ls. The dir command should translate command line parameters, for
example, and then call the ls command. See, that's why we need to run
programs within the same process.

Or, the ls and dir commands could use a brand-new JOS program with a new
name that does file-listing better than any other operating system.

Here is one for the road. JOS command-line utilities should consistently
recognize the -html option. This command-line parameter tells a program
when it should output HTML code to standard out. When the servletrunner
runs a program as a servlet, it should automatically pass the -html option
to all of our JOS command-line utilities.
