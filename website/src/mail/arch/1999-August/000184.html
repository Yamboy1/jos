check out BML, I don't have a link but its on alphaworks. also an
article on it at javaworld

I like the idea of &quot;spontaneous&quot; applications created from javabeans: I
click on a JPEG file, it opens a JPEG viewer but I want to (and somehow)
request the ability to edit it so an ImageEditor bean opens up and so
on. I have no idea how this would work... but it would be nice

Cheers,

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
