When you run javac, the java.* classes are already in your CLASSPATH. If
javac compiles java.util.Vector, there are now two Vector classes: the
one linked into the javac process and the one that javac is generating.

This is probably one reason why javac does not read development classes
from its ClassLoader. Your development classes need to be kept separate
from the classes used by the javac process. However, if your development
classes appear in your CLASSPATH before classes.zip and you are
compiling java.* classes, javac might become confused.

The other part of the question is: if the java.* classes must already be
in your CLASSPATH to compile anything, then how were those classes
compiled in the first place? The very first Java code would have either
been written by hand in assembly (bytecodes) or compiled with a compiler
written in a language other than Java. In both cases, the circular
dependency on Java has been eliminated. The first step would have been
to write enough Java code to be self supporting, then a compiler could
be written in Java. As new classes were added to the library, javac
would have been modified to take advantage of them.
