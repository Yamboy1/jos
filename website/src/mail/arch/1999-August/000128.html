<PRE>Once again, I prove that I can't get my point across in the first cut.

Also, it remindes me to remember to put up examples to help others as well
as myself understand the problem.

This was meant to separate the discovery/setup functionality from the
operational use.  Also, it enables the Device to store its state in a device
registry for easy recovery.  So, to answer your question: the ScannerDevice
would need a ScannerUSBDevice, ScannerSCSIDevice, ScannerParallelDevice, and
so on.  Each of these devices would subclass from the USBDevice, SCSIDevice,
&amp;c, and implement the ScannerDeviceInterface (or possibly the other way
around - SCSIDevice is an interface, and ScannerDevice is a class.  I
haven't played around with this, so we'll have to see what works best).

When I wrote the KeyboardDevice, it had the discovery/setup code, as well as
the very basic methods to get scancodes from the device.  The KeyboardDriver
translated these scancodes into usable data.  So we could have a
ISAKeyboardDevice, linked to a ISAKeyboardTranslator (which translates
scancodes into VA_? keycodes; this is a &quot;pass-through&quot; driver), which is
linked to KeyboardPressedSet (monitors the press/release state of each VA_?
key) and USAKeyboardDriver (which translates the VA_? push/release keycodes
into uppercase, lowercase, special shift combinations, and num-pad character
creation).

So I guess we can look at a Device simplisticly as a standard I/O Device
which inputs a byte stream, and outputs a byte stream.  Of course,
specialized subclasses (like the KeyboardDevice, with its specialized
implementations) do a tad bit more than that.  Or maybe we could look at a
Device as either a stream device (like a hard drive), or as an event device
(like a keyboard or mouse), or as both (like a modem or ethernet card).

&gt;&gt;<i> For instance, I pegged the video driver type to have a change mode
</I>method,
&gt;&gt;<i> and a method to collect the java.awt.GraphicsContext for the different
</I>modes
&gt;&gt;<i> (we may need a special method/context class for returning text modes).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>it should be vetoable by the OS(|UI).
</I>
Yes!!!  Thus, we really will have bean devices!

&gt;<i>firstly its GraphicsConfiguration that your thinking of, and it should
</I>&gt;<i>be able to describe text mode (after reviewing the source)
</I>
That was off the top of my head, so I'll take your word for it.

&gt;<i>whats the PrimaryHardwareManager (and why's it primary? shouldnt it be
</I>&gt;<i>static HardwareManager PrimaryHardwareManager; in the HM class? with a
</I>&gt;<i>getPrimaryHardwareManager()?)
</I>
Ah.  That was a beast unto itself.  That was my cut at handling platform
resources (like I/O Addresses, Memory, DMA, interrupts, and so on).  The
primary hardware manager handled routing the resource request to the
appropriate manager.  It was interesting in that it handled plug-n-play
well, where a device may request the best fit for a set of resources (for
instance, a Sound Blaster Pro needs one of IRQ 2, 5, 7, or 10).

I didn't use a static primary hardware manager, because I have a natural
aversion to using static data.  It leads to nasty situations where one
thread may need one kind of a class, and another thread needs a slightly
different class, or someone decides to use a different implementation in the
middle of runtime.  I was *especially* weary of this with a system level
variable.

&gt;<i>is name its device name? or its HRF name? (getHRName() also if its the
</I>&gt;<i>former), how about a getDescription() so a DeviceManager (config app)
</I>&gt;<i>can give some info.
</I>
Name for the Device would be the unique name for the device, such as PNP0600
(Generic ESDI/IDE/ATA hard disk controller), PNP0102 (MCA timers), and so
on.

&gt;<i>what about some state info, like isLoaded(), isActive() or hasDriver()?
</I>
Sure.  This was my first cut, where I wanted to leave it as open as
possible.  I would say isLoaded() is the only one really necessary.

&gt;<i>maybe a driver should plug into a device (setDriver(Driver d)) or can
</I>&gt;<i>there be more than one driver at a time?
</I>
I was pondering the other direction: MyDriver.setDevice( Device d ) so that
multiple drivers can use a single device.  Here's where Device.veto() would
come in handy, to prevent its use.  This would allow real-time upgrades to a
better Driver.


&lt;snip Driver.java&gt;
&gt;<i>the same goes for this with the getDescription() and all...
</I>
getDescription would be a human-readable string to indicate the operation of
the Driver.  We could use this method as well in the Device.

&gt;<i>speaking of descriptions, whats this a driver for? how about: Device
</I>&gt;<i>getDevice()?
</I>&gt;<i>some state info for this would be good too, like hasControlOfDevice()
</I>
Good points.

&gt;<i>You should also have an abstract DeviceAdaptor and DriverAdaptor for
</I>&gt;<i>faster impl.
</I>
You mean like java.awt.WindowAdapter which is a concrete class
implementation of java.awt.WindowListener?  Good idea.
