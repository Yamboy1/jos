firstly, its unusual but not non-standard. secondly, are you sugessting
that we have a smalltalk interpreter in JOS that apps send requests to?
(Im still not clear on what your talking about)

</I>
how is ubiquitous URI use get to be &quot;have to program java&quot;?

secondly an application get turn /home/mark/jos.txt into
file:/home/mark/jos.txt (or more likely: users/mark/home/jos.txt) and
send it to the URI server (when I say server I mean on the same computer
(although it doesnt have to be)) or send <A HREF="http://www.jos.org/index.html">http://www.jos.org/index.html</A>
to the URI server and get an input stream back. besides what about
outside an application where there is no context? this is for then.

the password in the URI is just part of the ftp url, it has nothing to
do with anything.

what application framework? explain.

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
