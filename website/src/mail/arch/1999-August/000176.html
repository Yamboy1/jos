you can do this now (well not exactly now) if you make a Script (or you
could use IBM's BML) that does whats in main, seeing as how GSI will
allow Scripts to be run as applications

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
