What is a program? Why is a program not an object?

I understand you do what I do. You write one line of code in a static
main() method.

My main method looks either like

public class DemoApplication {
  public static main( String[] args ) {
    new DemoApplication().run();
  }
}

or

public class DemoProgram {
  public static void main( String[] args ) {
    new DemoProgram( args ).run();
  }
}

I don't have a lot of fun writing pretty much the same static main() for
each Java application. But, I'm sure you'll agree that instances of
DemoApplication and DemoProgram are objects.

&gt;<i>Reuse at the Program interface level is how things work in the
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;procedural&quot; world.
</I>
What is a &quot;procedural&quot; world? Is object-oriented not procedural? Are you
contrasting a step-by-step batch process to an event-driven one?

I understand that a OO scripting language should be able to coordinate the
activity of a collection of JavaBeans. One JavaBean should be able to load
and use another. Many beans can be developed into one new bean. It is
recursive as well as reusable. A huge and complex bean is still an object.

If I want to, I can create a custom JavaBean that reads a collection of
beans from an object stream. To configure my custom bean, it only has one
&quot;property&quot;, an object stream. That would be a pretty powerful bean. It
could reuse any beans that have been serialized.

At some point, a requestor must initialize my custom JavaBean and set its
object stream property. And at some point, this bean must be finalized.
Maybe it shuts down when the JVM shuts down, like a static property of a
class. Maybe it &quot;listens&quot; for a shut down request. In the big picture, the
lifetime of a bean has a beginning and end. It is initialized and then
finalized. While the specific steps between initialization and finalization
are unplanned, this is a predictable, step-by-step batch process.

An event driven model builds upon a procedural one. Without procedures
(methods), there are no events.
