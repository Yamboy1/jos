<PRE>You want to know how that method is implemented? Click once and you'll know.

Source-Doc will have a radically different architecture from JavaDoc.
Source-Doc assumes you are writing for an open source project and want
everyone to see the source code. Source-Doc will be powerful enough to
provide source code and documentation to 100,000+ packages. It will
provides multiple-level index for packages, fields, methods, interfaces and
classes.

Source-Doc is based on an idea of *any* progamming language should have
cross-reference documentation. It works for Java. It will work for C/C++.

JavaDoc only works with Java, not the C/C++ code you write for native
methods. JavaDoc architecture is a dead end. It works only in snap-shot
mode, where all packages must be passed on the command line. It creates
static HTML files and writes them to disk. Ugh.

Source-Doc has the potential to *execute* any class. Do you want to see
what that Java Bean looks like? Click once and you'll know.

Source-Doc is based on three loosely-coupled components:
 - syntax highlighter
 - pretty printer
 - document tool

The syntax highlighter will provide color syntax highlighting for any
programming language. How do you do that? Each language must have a unique
file extension. The file extension is used as a key into a
registry-compatible keyword file:

// keyword.ini
[extension]
c
cpp
java

[java]
if
goto
return

[c]
if
goto
return

[cpp]
if
goto
return

The pretty printer is responsible for two things: width and style. The
width required by a client agent is variable, so it must be passed as a
parameter to the pretty printer. The style required by an end-user is
variable, so it must also be passed as a parameter. With this pretty
printer, everybody can see the code in the style they prefer, not the style
preferred by the author. The pretty printer does not do syntax highlighting.

// prettyprint.ini
[styles]
k&amp;r
jos

[k&amp;r]
braceonseparateline=true

[jos]
braceonseparateline=true

Sometimes you want to see the documentation, not the source code. The
documentor extracts the document-compatible comments from the source code,
similar to JavaDoc.

But, there is a huge and powerful difference. The documentor is not a huge
batch process. It documents one source file at a time.

When Source-Doc is implemented as a servlet, the original source code
should be stored in an archive file. That's it. The source code is
automatically highlighted and pretty-printed dynamically by the servlet
without storing temporary files. Each request can choose a different width
and style. The source code is read-only.

What about dynamic JavaDoc? The servlet extracts documentation as the
servlet is used. It maintains a cross-reference index to all the source
code that has been read. When the servlet &quot;sees&quot; a source file for the
first time, it extracts the documentation to a cache. The cache enables the
servlet to generate an index of packages, methods, fields, interfaces and
classes efficiently.

In other words, you write the source code. Source-Doc automatically does
the rest. This is the perfect companion to an open source project. Both the
&quot;JavaDoc&quot; and source code are cross-referenced.
