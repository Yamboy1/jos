so JOS would know the ScannerDevice but the manufacturer would need to
provide a ScannerDriver

reflection is good, but something like BeanInfo would be faster (of
course we need to do both)

it should be vetoable by the OS(|UI).

firstly its GraphicsConfiguration that your thinking of, and it should
be able to describe text mode (after reviewing the source)

&gt;<i> package jos.platform.device;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> import jos.platform.hardwareResource.PrimaryHardwareManager;
</I>&gt;<i> import jos.platform.driver.Driver;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> /**
</I>&gt;<i>  * Generic interface for a Device.  It handles the initial
</I>&gt;<i>  * discovery and setup of the actual device.
</I>&gt;<i>  *
</I>&gt;<i>  * @version 1.0
</I>&gt;<i>  * @author  Matt Albrecht
</I>&gt;<i>  */
</I>&gt;<i> public interface Device extends java.io.Serializable
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>    public Driver [] searchAndSetup( PrimaryHardwareManager phm );
</I>&gt;<i>    public String getName();
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>
whats the PrimaryHardwareManager (and why's it primary? shouldnt it be
static HardwareManager PrimaryHardwareManager; in the HM class? with a
getPrimaryHardwareManager()?)

is name its device name? or its HRF name? (getHRName() also if its the
former), how about a getDescription() so a DeviceManager (config app)
can give some info.

what about some state info, like isLoaded(), isActive() or hasDriver()?

maybe a driver should plug into a device (setDriver(Driver d)) or can
there be more than one driver at a time?

&gt;<i> package jos.platform.driver;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> /**
</I>&gt;<i>  * The Driver interface to a physical/virtual device.
</I>&gt;<i>  */
</I>&gt;<i> public interface Driver extends java.io.Serializable
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>   public String getName();
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>
the same goes for this with the getDescription() and all... 

speaking of descriptions, whats this a driver for? how about: Device
getDevice()

some state info for this would be good too, like hasControlOfDevice()

You should also have an abstract DeviceAdaptor and DriverAdaptor for
faster impl.

Cheers,
