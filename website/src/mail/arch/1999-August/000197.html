<PRE>&gt;<i> Literally, I am trying to build a color-syntax highlighting program for
</I>&gt;<i> C/C++/Java code. I want to write it once and only once because a program
</I>&gt;<i> should be reusable. It must run as a batch application, where a GUI prompts
</I>&gt;<i> for parameters and the Run button write static HTML files to disk. And, it
</I>&gt;<i> must run as an applet on my website. And, it must run inside an HTML
</I>&gt;<i> browser, under the control of a client-side servlet. And, it must run
</I>&gt;<i> inside an HTTP service, under the control of a server-side servlet.
</I>
	OOP strikes again.  The hard part of the code should be isolated
into a method like syntaxColor( InputStream is, OutputStream os ).  With
that in place, wrappers for each of the situations in which you're
interested in should be easy to create... or is that the point you're
trying to make with the Program (etc) interface?  That is to say, is the
point not that Program should automagically adapt to each of the above
situations, but that a standard wrapper should exist for each situation
(except the GUI one, perhaps*), one that operates by using the Program
interface? 

	* : If the syntaxColor()-containing object is a Bean, it should be
possible to create a generic reflection-based GUI interface object, which,
when passed a Bean, extracts all the possible settings and their type, and
creates a dialog box of those settings (and their defaults as defined by
the result of a getX() before a setX()) with the proper widgets.  (I would
imagine that JavaBean-based app builders already do this...)
