</I>
Note: I added spaces for clarity.

The URI and command line are based on the same mechanism. The &quot;pipe&quot; model
comes from a command line. While a command line is platform-dependent
(usually), a URI is platform-independent.

The ftp: scheme is a very good example. Remind me again, though. I am a
little rusty with ftp. Doesn't ftp: expect name and password parameters? In
the example above, &quot;?username=jeeves&amp;password=cafebabe&quot; would be part of
ftp: scheme. I'll just move the parameters to ftp: forward:

<A HREF="ftp://database.server.net/archives/images/contents.jar">ftp://database.server.net/archives/images/contents.jar</A>
?username=jeeves&amp;password=cafebabe |/update/latest.zip |/acquired/foo.jpg

&gt;<i>The above URI would authenticate with the FTP protocol and open the
</I>&gt;<i>foo.jpg image in the latest.zip archive in the contents.jar archive in
</I>&gt;<i>the specified directory of the specific server.
</I>
As long as latest.zip is not password protected, it will work. I am
concerned with what happens when latest.zip *is* password protected. Still
using pipes, this URI would become:

<A HREF="ftp://database.server.net/archives/images/contents.jar">ftp://database.server.net/archives/images/contents.jar</A>
?username=jeeves&amp;password=cafebabe |/update/latest.zip ?password=jos
|<i>/acquired/foo.jpg
</I>
&gt;<i>Using installed MIME types, or possibly extensions, the software can
</I>&gt;<i>automatically decode (ZIP, JAR and JPG here for examples are required).
</I>
Let's talk a little about MIME types. MIME types only hint at a default
decoding and presentation. It isn't absolute; it is only a clue.
Explicitely adding the protocol should produce the same results.

<A HREF="ftp://database.server.net/archives/images/contents.jar">ftp://database.server.net/archives/images/contents.jar</A> ?
username=jeeves&amp;password=cafebabe | archive:zip:/update/latest.zip |
image:jpeg:/acquired/foo.jpg

Imagine, though, that I have made up my mind and really want to see the
contents of an JPEG file in hexidecimal notation. I want the default MIME
type to be *ignored*. My decision should be reflected in the URI. Maybe it
should be like this:

<A HREF="ftp://database.server.net/archives/images/contents.jar">ftp://database.server.net/archives/images/contents.jar</A>
?username=jeeves&amp;password=cafebabe | archive:zip:/update/latest.zip |
file:hex:/acquired/foo.jpg

Sure, if there is a table of default MIME types, I may be able to imply
decoding with file extensions. But our URI architecture must be able to
support explicit choices.

&gt;<i>I don't believe that the pipe is reserved in URI's up to now, so maybe
</I>&gt;<i>we could use it, at least JOS internally?
</I>
Sometimes, I wonder how we're going to succeed with any of this. The URI is
supposed to be a global, platform-independent model. Current URIs are
monolythic and short-sighted. We *need* to do things with URIs in JOS that
none of the other operating systems can do (yet and maybe ever). We are out
in front. We are on the bleeding edge.

From RFC 2396, the verticle bar (|) is considered an &quot;unwise&quot; character.
We're supposed to be careful not to think about JOS as an island. JOS will
interact with all other operating systems. How can we limit URIs to
internal use only?

uri-pipe := uri &quot;|&quot; uri &quot;|&quot; uri

uri := scheme &quot;:&quot; path [ &quot;?&quot; query ] [ &quot;#&quot; fragment ]

Decoding a uri-pipe must be performed first, prior to decoding an
individual uri inside a pipe. Each uri inside a uri-pipe may have query
part and fragment part. The final MIME type of the uri-pipe is the MIME
type of the last uri inside the pipe.

This is almost right. But it means that all URIs that already use the
pipe--even though its an unwise character--will not be compatible with the
uri-pipe. Incompatibility with all those existing URIs is bad, very bad.

The problem would be solved if we choose another &quot;symbol&quot; for the pipe.
Hey, what about this:

uri-pipe := uri &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; uri &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; uri

Oh, and another thing. A client agent must know *immediately* that a URI is
a pipe and not a normal URI. We want those old client agents to display a
message first, before they do lots of work they can't finish.

I always imagined that the client agent would do all the work. Then our new
scheme would be compatible with existing Internet services. So the client
agent must process a uri-pipe. The client agent must download the whole
archive, even to get one small file.

I suppose it is possible for an FTP service to extract the latest.zip, then
extract foo.jpg and return only foo.jpg to the client agent. By embedding
one uri into another, a client agent sends the entire request to the
service. Wouldn't this work?

<A HREF="ftp://database.server.net/">ftp://database.server.net/</A> &lt;archive:archives/images/contents.jar&gt;
&lt;archive:/update/latest.zip&gt; /acquired/foo.jpg
?username=jeeves&amp;password=cafebabe

Oh, in fact, you should be able to choose client-side or server-side
decoding of a uri-pipe. Your pipe scheme would be best suited for
client-side decoding. My scheme would be best suited for server-side decoding.

The client agent would &quot;see&quot; this uri:

<A HREF="ftp://database.server.net/aquired/foo.jpg">ftp://database.server.net/aquired/foo.jpg</A> ?username=jeeves&amp;password=cafebabe

It would connect to an FTP service with username and password and download
/aquired/foo.jpg. The FTP service would recieve this:

/archives/images/contents.jar |/update/latest.zip |/acquired/foo.jpg 
or
&lt;archive:archives/images/contents.jar&gt;
&lt;archive:/update/latest.zip&gt; /acquired/foo.jpg

If there's a vertical bar (|) in a request or if the FTP service sees &quot;&lt;&quot;
as the first character in the request, it knows immediately that its an
embedded URI. It extracts /images/contents.jar and here's what's left:

/update/latest.zip |/acquired/foo.jpg
or
&lt;archive:/update/latest.zip&gt; /acquired/foo.jpg

Again, if there's a verticle bar (|) or a &quot;&lt;&quot; as the first character, it
knows immediately that its an embedded URI. It extracts /update/latest.zip
and here's what's left:

/aquired/foo.jpg

The FTP service OR client agent must keep track of its file source. At the
beginning, it gets files from the OS file subsystem. With each archive, it
gets files from an archive.

A client agent would use its local cache. While a client agent would
download a large archive to extract a small file, the client agent might be
more efficient with subsequent requests. If the large archive has already
been downloaded to its local cache, it won't download or extract it again.
It just extracts another small file.

When running bytecode for an applet or servlet across the Internet, it is
more efficient to download the whole archive once rather than download one
class file at a time from the archive. That's yet another reason to have
the client agent handle the URI pipe and/or embedded URIs.
