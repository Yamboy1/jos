</I>&gt;<i> &gt;So I would like to join these into same group. For Graphics Adaptor, it is
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Memory/IO/IRQ Device. But it would not be a stream type driver.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> for me.

Device

StreamDevice

but why event device? wouldnt it be more economical for the drivers to
produce events?
like the mouse event has a hasMoved() function the device waits for,
when it reads positive it creates the event; a different driver could
create a different event
 
&gt;<i> &gt;For those isLoaded(), hasDriver() methods, these methods should be put it
</I>&gt;<i> into a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Generic Device Manager to control how many instances should be keep. If we
</I>&gt;<i> put
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;these things to driver and let them to control it, it would be little bit
</I>&gt;<i> dangerous.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> hasDriver() *may* be appropriate for many devices (like HardDrive device - I
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't like multiple drivers, unaware of each other, messing around at
</I>&gt;<i> low-level at the same time, but I don't care how many drivers listen to the
</I>&gt;<i> MouseDevice).  isLoaded(), I feel, may be a reiterative method: if the
</I>&gt;<i> Driver can find the device, it has been loaded.  Or maybe I'm not seeing
</I>&gt;<i> something with this.  I dunno.
</I>
hasDriver could throw OperationUnsupportedException or it could be in a
UniDriver interface (horrid name, but you get the idea).

couldnt isLoaded() be for a device like a zip drive that you can plug
and unplug at runtime, for speed the user sets it up to always have the
device loaded (since he only takes it off to transfer data on a friends
computer, for an example)
 
&gt;<i> Ok.  Last time.  This is your class.  This is your class on JOS.  Any
</I>&gt;<i> questions?  But seriously, here's snippets from my old code for a clearer
</I>&gt;<i> statement, followed by an overview of the design:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *** WARNING *** The following text has extremely long class names.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> /**

</I>&gt;<i>  * HardwareResourceManager, so that a request
</I>&gt;<i>  * does not mix different kinds of resources together.  This may be changed
</I>&gt;<i> later
</I>&gt;<i>  * on if a need (or want) arises, but for now it is the easiest way to do
</I>&gt;<i> things.
</I>&gt;<i>  *
</I>&gt;<i>  * @author    Matt Albrecht

</I>&gt;<i>  */
</I>&gt;<i> public class PrimaryHardwareManager extends HardwareResourceManager;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> /**
</I>&gt;<i>  * &lt;P&gt;Allocates and deallocates hardware resources for a specific type of
</I>&gt;<i>  * resource.  Checks if the resource allocation requests request already

</I>&gt;<i>  */
</I>&gt;<i> public abstract class HardwareResourceManager;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this model, a &quot;HardwareResourceRequest&quot; is sent to the
</I>&gt;<i> PrimaryHardwareResourceManager (to which every known specific
</I>&gt;<i> HardwareResourceManager has registered itself with, or more accurately, the
</I>&gt;<i> PrimaryHardwareResourceManager has registered all known
</I>&gt;<i> HardwareResourceManagers to itself).  A request consists of a set of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;HardwareResourceSetting&quot;s dedicated for a specific HardwareResourceManager
</I>&gt;<i> (like IOAddressHardwareResourceSetting is intended for
</I>&gt;<i> IOAddressHardwareResourceManager).  The PrimaryHardwareResourceManager
</I>&gt;<i> routes the request to the specific HardwareResourceManager, which analyzes
</I>&gt;<i> the request, and allocates the best fit HardwareResourceSetting (if there is
</I>&gt;<i> one), and creates a HardwareResourceInterface based on that setting for the
</I>&gt;<i> Driver to use.  This interface has the native code ties.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is it any wonder no one volunteered to use it?
</I>
I think my brain melted, jeez
 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;maybe a driver should plug into a device (setDriver(Driver d)) or can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;there be more than one driver at a time?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I was pondering the other direction: MyDriver.setDevice( Device d ) so
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; multiple drivers can use a single device.  Here's where Device.veto()
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; come in handy, to prevent its use.  This would allow real-time upgrades
</I>&gt;<i> to a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; better Driver.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &lt;snip Driver.java&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;the same goes for this with the getDescription() and all...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; getDescription would be a human-readable string to indicate the operation
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the Driver.  We could use this method as well in the Device.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;you should have a getDescription() and a getHRName(), if you make a tree
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;of all of them you need getHRName for the name on the tree node, PNP6000
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(or whatever) will hardly make sense to the average person.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;or better yet getName() is the HR one and you have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;get[Device|Driver]Name() for the ID
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Great.  After typing those enormous class names above, I'll believe
</I>&gt;<i> anything.  But really, that sounds like the way to go.
</I>
be easier for creating a visual device tree at the very least...

Cheers,

	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
