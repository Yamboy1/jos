<PRE>I have every reason to believe that a Java operating system -- being
platform independent -- is capable of serving all OS market segments, not
just one:

JOS-Hybrid
Some people don't want a new OS; they want us to fix the OS they already
have. This configuration of JOS is like a Java virtual machine. It will run
on top of all other operating system. Like LOADLIN provides a mechanism to
load Linux while running MS-DOS, JOS-Hybrid uses a foreign operating system
for all its low-level drivers. This is the model used by Java(tm) and
José(tm).

JOS-NC
Some people don't want a IBM PC; they just want a more powerful terminal,
like a network computer. This configuration of JOS will run on a machine
that is dependent on a network connection.

JOS-PC
Some people don't want a new personal computer; they want a new OS for the
computer they already have. This configuration of JOS will run as (1) a
stand-alone machine, (2) a network client, and (3) a network server.

JOS-GPP
Some people don't want one server; they want lots of servers. This
configuration of JOS will run as a general purpose processor, where there
is no need for a console (no keyboard, no mouse, no monitor). This
configuration is in high demand for factory-configured server farms.
