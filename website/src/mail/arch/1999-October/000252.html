So you're saying that I must create an instance of a Class object for an
interface, let's say the InputStream interface, and pass it to a registry
(or whatever) and it returns an instance of every known service that can
return an implementation of an InputStream interface?

In other words:

Class c = Class.forName( &quot;java.io.InputStream&quot; );
Service[] list = TheRegistry.getService( c );

&gt;<i>In this manner, you won't need to know the name of the service; all you need

With the Smart API, you don't need to know the class name of the service.
You don't need to create an instance of a class. You need to have a uniform
resource locator (URI) to get an instance of a &quot;service&quot; or object you
want. It is something like this:

URI uri = new URI( &quot;in:gzip:buffer:<A HREF="http://www.jos.org/download/example.gz"">http://www.jos.org/download/example.gz&quot;</A> );
InputStream input = (InputStream) uri.getObject();

When you want to use a &quot;service&quot; on a specific digital resource, the Smart
API takes you there directly.

It seems that both a registry (or whatever) and Smart API enable a program
to search for a service and then use it. A Smart API has the flexibility of
a query string and fragment to pre-select the kinds of services you're
interested in. The Smart API separates the configuration of the factory
from the use of a factory. The configuration of a factory is centralized.

It seems that the Smart API is more universal. It has broader scope. It
completely covers the registry (or whatever) mechanism. The selection of a
service can be encapsulated inside a subsystem, and should be. Service
selection and factories can be abstracted for use with every program. You
want a digital resource, such as a service.

If Jini is really the digital resource you want, you can get an appropriate
instance of it through the Smart API. Some machines are Jini-enabled; some
are not. The Smart API can be aware of Jini, but not dependent on it.
