For me, personally, this is one of the most compelling reasons to build a
new operating system. I have been in pursuit of a goal of &quot;No installation
required.&quot; Here is what that means:

Your OS must include Java runtime environment(s). Either you upgrade your
OS to Java-ready by installing a JRE, or you purchase a Java-ready OS.

Once you have a JRE, you do not need to explicitely install any other
application. Just like applets are downloaded on-demand from a network
service, your applications can be downloaded on-demand from diskette,
CD-ROM, ZIP disk or across the network.

Bytecode is relatively compact. When JOS has a bytecode cache, only the
most recently used bytecode will be stored locally.

After working with an NC version of JOS, I find that the application
service is critical to the future of JOS. An application service works like
this:

GET &lt;package-name&gt; PACKAGE/1e
[DATE:&lt;date&gt;]

When a client-side bytecode cache needs a package, it downloads a package
from an application service. The protocol between bytecode cache and
application service looks familiar because it follows HTTP.

1. An application service should download a package and only a package. It
should never download more than one package. It should never download one
class at a time.

2. A bytecode cache needs an optional download. When a package stored in a
cache is up-to-date, there is no need to download it again.

A custom class loader uses a bytecode cache. When a JVM requests a class
from any package, the custom class loader goes first to a local cache to
find all classes in a package. If the package is up-to-date, it is used. If
not, the bytecode cache downloads a package from an application service and
stores it &quot;locally&quot;.

A bytecode cache might use a RAM disk for storing its package files. In the
case of a network computer (NC), the cache is discarded when the computer
is reset (re-booted).

A bytecode cache might use a hard disk for storing its package files. When
configured, the cache might be limited to a certain amount of space on the
drive or a certain percentage of space.

When a custom class loader uses a bytecode cache consistently, it does not
matter where the original bytecode is stored. Even when original bytecode
is stored in an archive, the application service provides package files.

One bytecode cache can be chained to another. You can set aside a bytecode
cache on the network that collects bytecode from the Internet. Like a
firewall, the bytecode cache must deny any request for untrusted packages.

By combining a few of these mechanisms, the boot image for JOS can be
small. The boot image loads the JVM and a custom class loader. Through the
custom class loader, it loads the init class. Even the init class can be
downloaded through the bytecode cache mechanism. Bytecode becomes stored
virtually. With this assumption, there is no explicite installation required.
