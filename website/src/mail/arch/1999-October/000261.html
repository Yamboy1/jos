<PRE>&gt;<i> On the other hand, there is a precedent for a mispronunciation of JOS. Just
</I>&gt;<i> like I say M-S-doss&quot; when pronouncing MS-DOS, I like to say &quot;joss&quot; when
</I>&gt;<i> pronouncing JOS. I always wondered why JOS isn't spelled more like Joe or
</I>&gt;<i> Joseph. If we were working on the JO project, we would build a JO system.
</I>
It would just be &quot;Java Operating&quot; then though...

I've been saying it &quot;joss&quot; too, I figure its either that or saying each letter seperatley -- &quot;J-O-S&quot;. I'm guessing most people would just say &quot;joss&quot; so I don't see any reason not to say it like that.
 
&gt;<i> And again, in a Wiki article somewhere, I read that it might be pronounced
</I>&gt;<i> J-oss (jay-oss). The system &quot;subsystem&quot; exists. We should call it
</I>&gt;<i> something. And be consistent about it. Would it be fair to listen to
</I>&gt;<i> proposals for a new name for JOSystem?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While the name of a subsystem, like JOSystem, is not critical to the
</I>&gt;<i> success of an internal project (internal to the JOS Project team), it *is*
</I>&gt;<i> critical to the success of an external product. After working with a
</I>&gt;<i> code-name for the JOSystem for this long, it might not be a bad thing to
</I>&gt;<i> think about a product name for the product. The JOSystem project should
</I>&gt;<i> produce something that's distributable to other programmers, external to
</I>&gt;<i> the JOS Project team.
</I>
I don't really see the benifits, someones just going to download the installer and get JOSCore (JOSBox + JOSystem) the extensions for their computer (drivers and what not) and applications (notably JADE). If your a programmer or an expert user your going to find out its called JOSystem, otherwise you don't care or don't know.
 
&gt;<i> Here again is a good reason to establish a distribution group sooner --
</I>&gt;<i> rather than later, as Iain suggested. It is important to pick a name at the
</I>&gt;<i> right time. Not too soon. Not too late. When you pick a name too soon, it
</I>&gt;<i> artificially delays a good idea. Pick a name too late, it artificially
</I>&gt;<i> delays a great idea.
</I>
so everythings going to have a project name and a product name? I don't think we need the later until the beta stage, personally.
 
&gt;<i> What's in a name? A rose by any other name would smell...like ragweed.
</I>
it would smell the same, but no one would buy it.

Cheers,
DigiGod

	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
