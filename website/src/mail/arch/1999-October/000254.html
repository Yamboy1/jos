<PRE>Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the issue of JOS namespace on the
architecture group. The JOS namespace is confusing because it is backward
from the tradition established by Sun Microsystems (and others) for API vs.
implementation.

For the record, the java.* packages were intended to be an API, not
implementation. It is most unfortunate that Sun Microsystems lost their
original plans for the java.* packages by adding lots and lots of
implementation. The sun.* packages were (are) Sun Microsystems' private
implementation of an API. The com.sun.* packages were (are) Sun
Microsystems' product namespace.

There are three parts to the puzzle. First there is the public API for JOS.
By tradition, it should have been called jos.*. It should be heavy on
interfaces and light on implementation. The org.jos.api.* package might be
a substitute for the jos.*, except that the API can be implemented by any
organization, not just the JOS Project at www.org.jos. The API is supposed
to be independent, designed by the JOS Project and implemented by anyone.

Second, there are the packages the API depends on. The JOS Project seems to
use both jos.* and org.jos.* packages for this purpose.

Third, there are the applications that depend on the API. The JOS Project
consistently uses org.jos.* packages for this.

When there is uncertainty and doubt as to the &quot;right&quot; name for a package,
it spell trouble for the long-term success of the project.

Here is my recommendation:

A &quot;Distribution&quot; group should be created to discuss the implications of JOS
distribution. This group should focus on the impact packages have on
distribution. Members of this group should develop recommendations for the
packaging (and repackaging) for the JOS API.

This group should be responsible for the collection and integration of the
many different archives, which have already been created by the JOS Project.

This group should provide one-stop-shopping to anyone who wants a runtime,
standard or technical distribution of JOS. This group should be responsible
for maintaining the original mirror site (at www.jos.org) for all source
code created by members of the JOS Project.

It should develop simple things like the legal template for source code
falling under the JOS free software license. It should encourage, negotiate
and discuss the difficulties of distributing open source code for a loosely
knit group of C/C++/Java programmers on the Internet.

It should not prevent volunteers from developing source code and
distributing it to members of the JOS Project. It might become involved
when two (or more) members want to use a different namespace for the same
thing; or, the same namespace for different things.

If there is already a group focused on these concerns, which group is that?
Where are its members? While I once asked for an &quot;API&quot; group to discuss
just the JOS Project namespace, I am convinced that &quot;API&quot; is a
special-interest group within &quot;Distribution&quot; because &quot;Distribution&quot; must be
responsible to many people external to the JOS Project. They must be
responsible for JOS &quot;licensees&quot;. (Whenever you have a free software
license, you must expect &quot;licensees&quot;.)

As a programmer, distributing functional source code for the JOS Project is
not easy. If it is difficult for me, as a programmer, it must difficult, if
not impossible, for an end-user. Many people just want to *run* the
software. They do not own a compiler. They only know a little about a JRE,
nothing about a JDK.
