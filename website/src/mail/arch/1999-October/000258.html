My mistake. I understand how JOSystem is called JOSystem and documented as
JOSystem, and not JOSSystem.

On the other hand, there is a precedent for a mispronunciation of JOS. Just
like a say M-S-doss&quot; when pronouncing MS-DOS, I like to say &quot;joss&quot; when
pronouncing JOS. I always wondered why JOS isn't spelled more like Joe or
Joseph. If we were working on the JO project, we would build a JO system.

And again, in a Wiki article somewhere, I read that it might be pronounced
J-oss (jay-oss). The system &quot;subsystem&quot; exists. We should call it
something. And be consistent about it. Would it be fair to listen to
proposals for a new name for JOSystem?

While the name of a subsystem, like JOSystem, is not critical to the
success of an internal project (internal to the JOS Project team), it *is*
critical to the success of an external product. After working with a
code-name for the JOSystem for this long, it might not be a bad thing to
think about a product name for the product. The JOSystem project should
produce something that's distributable to other programmers, external to
the JOS Project team.

Here again is a good reason to establish a distribution group sooner --
rather than later, as Iain suggested. It is important to pick a name at the
right time. Not too soon. Not too late. When you pick a name too soon, it
artificially delays a good idea. Pick a name too late, it artificially
delays a great idea.

What's in a name? A rose by any other name would smell...like ragweed.
