FYI- I've installed it and am running it....two things I noticed right
off... My Swing apps load much faster... and they fixed a display problem...

It seems they have included an "Application" and "Server" version of
hotspot, (the old one is now the server version).

its good they fixed those things, I havent downloaded or installed it
(and frankly Im burned out on downloading so its going to have to wait
awhile) but from reading the article the most useful thing to JOS is the
Runtime.setHook(Thread hook); (I'm doing that from memory, could be
wrong) that lets you make a Thread to start executing when the VM is
shutdown. Other then saving time in workarounds with System.exit() (that
wouldnt work if someone went to restart their computer anyway) this
offers us a chance to avoid yet another "system event".

Cheers,
DigiGod
