Well, most of the code is C++.  Very little assembler.  And, in a past
life, I had to write some non-trivial amounts of 680x0 assembler, and,
let me tell you, it beats the hell out of writing x86 assembler (at
least the Motorola parts don't think it's 1972 when they reset).  So, I
should be able to help somewhat.    
 
&gt;<i> yet: I don't know how much of this is true (I mean, if the Visor Company
</I>&gt;<i> really plans supporting multiple OSes), since I only read about this in
</I>&gt;<i> this article;
</I>
I do not know the details of the PalmOS API.  Perhaps it is possible to
have JOS simply be another &quot;vanilla&quot; Palm application.  That would
certainly be the path of least resistance -- were I you, I would
definitely start that way until events forced me off that path.

</I>&gt;<i> but I looked at some developers-docs for the visor, and it says that
</I>&gt;<i> Visor uses the &quot;Dragonball EZ&quot; (I guess it's a Codename for some 680x0 CPU);

L0pht Heavy Industries has a PalmPilot development page at:
	<A HREF="http://www.L0pht.com/~kingpin/pilot.html">http://www.L0pht.com/~kingpin/pilot.html</A>

I know there are others (some are listed at the bottom of L0pht's
page).  If you find some really good ones, let me know. (Did I mention
I've got a Palm V and my wife has a Palm III?  I am a Big Fan of Palm
devices.)

Oh, here's another useful page (ain't Altavista great?
