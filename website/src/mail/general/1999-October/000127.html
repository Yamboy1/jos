I would agree.  Since we don't have an &quot;official&quot; release of anything 
yet, I'd encourage individuals to create their own releases of code 
they have in working order.  Most of the JOS code is GPL or BSD 
licensed and you're both legally and morally in the clear to do this 
(as long as you follow the rules like distributing the source and 
including approprate copyright info).  Along the same vein, it would 
seem to me that you're welcome by the licenses that we use to 
make your own distribution if you want.

When we do finally ship something as an &quot;official&quot; release 
distribution of JOS, we'll want to probably clarify that either the 
code &quot;belongs&quot; to a particular JOS release, or specifically state 
that it is NOT part of a particular JOS release just to avoid 
confusion.  (I think Gilbert's excellent technical release is more of a 
developers preview release than a public release).  But certainly, 
you should try and get your code out into other hands to use and 
test as soon as you feel comfortable with it.  At least that's my 
opinion on it.
