<PRE>yo group,

take a look at this story:
<A HREF="http://www.palminfocenter.com/view_Story.asp?ID=179">http://www.palminfocenter.com/view_Story.asp?ID=179</A>

the guy writes about the new Visor (www.handspring.com (I hope thats the 
correct URL, if not, try www.handsprings.com)

I guess most of you will have at least heard something about the Visor

for those who haven't: its like a Palm clone; its capable of running PalmOS 
and looks like a PalmPilot; it has one big advantage over the palm: the 
&quot;springboard&quot;; that allows you to extend the visor, using modules that look 
like the gameboy gamemodules; you simply plug them into the back of the 
visor; but those modules can be anything from extra memory over modems to 
digital cameras;

now: in this article, the writer claims that it might be possible to change 
the operating system of the visor by using such a module;
and not just as some weird hack, but to give users the freedom to use the 
OS of their choice;

wouldnt that be *coolest* Idea for JOS?

I mean, not just somehow porting the core system to the KVM and then 
running it ontop of the PalmPilot, as some kind of gimmick;
but as a real new OS for the Palm!! (pardon my screaming)

does anyone know if this article is nothing but Horse droppings or if 
there's some truth in it;

murphee

ps: i'm posting this here, since I wasn't sure if this would fit into the 
Kernel or Arch group;
