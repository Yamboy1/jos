<PRE>I don't see frames as a must have feature, but they can be very useful.
However, if people don't want a frames based web site then there's no need
to go annoying anyone!!!

I'll start having a go at a bit of re-organisation then.  I can't promise
huge amounts of time but bits and bobs here and there.

Cheers,

Tim.

Subject:  Re: [JOS] Wiki Pages




Hello,
&gt;<i> Just thought I'd give a bit of input on the new style wiki pages.  I
</I>think
&gt;<i> they look really good.  Easy to read and pretty easy to navigate around.
</I>I
&gt;<i> can't remember who is responsible for them (hence mailing here) but well
</I>&gt;<i> done.
</I>Thanks.
&gt;<i> Any thoughts on producing a frame based version at some point?  I know
</I>this
&gt;<i> produces a few issues.  Actually, if you need any help on the page
</I>&gt;<i> re-design / update then let me know.
</I>No plans at the present.  There seemed to be quite a few people that
were violently opposed to frames so I had pretty much removed it from
consideration in the redesign.  Do you consider it a &quot;must have&quot; feature?
If you have time, I'd really appreciate help reorganizing the Wiki.  The
project signup page is not organized well.  If you could try and
reorganize it that would help.  Actually we need a separate wiki page
that is a nice list of active JOS projects (as a compliment to the working
groups listing) with a link to each project's wiki page, and perhaps a
short description.  Right now, its pretty difficult to figure out exactly
what are the active jos projects...  You know, where actual code is
being created to create concrete programs (as opposed to the working
groups where ideas are being discussed and coding is optional).
The main wiki page could use some reorganization, and the jos irc
meeting announcement should probably be moved to a separate
JosAnnounce wiki page with only a one liner announcement and a link
to the times on the main wiki page.  *whew*
I have been looking over the original wiki site (the site where we got the
first copy of the wiki) and the way they keep things organized is they
have several self-appointed wiki organizers that just go around and clean
up pages, create &quot;meta-pages&quot; that basically summarize groups of
pages and provide links to them, and organize the links between pages
to make sense.  We (jos wiki) only seem to have people that create the
&quot;leaf&quot; pages of the wiki.  We're missing the self-appointed organizers
that help to organize, summarize and arrange the wiki pages.   So if you
could, whenever you have the time, just start organizing when you see a
need, it would help a ton.  I think many members are reluctant to edit
other people's pages or create summaries which basically leaves a ton
of pages &quot;stranded&quot; with only a few links to them buried deep inside the
bodies of other pages...
Sorry for the rant.  Just trying to be a cheerleader for some self-
appointed wiki organizers to emerge and start aggressively organizing
the wiki.  :)
