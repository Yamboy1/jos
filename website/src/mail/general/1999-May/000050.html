<PRE>Hi everybody

We had a really good meeting today, we covered a lot, mainly stuff 
about the web site.

The web site:

* We need volunteers to be wiki guardians, there job is to maintain 
the wiki pages group them together, index them, etc.
* A Java applet for editing the wiki pages.
* Add support to the wiki web for searching and indexing of wik pages.
* Project status and events pages need to be made.
* Also a few changes to the wike templates.

Organizational structure:

* We need a point of contact or representative, this person will just 
be a stand in until a person can be voted into the position.  The 
main reason for this is this email message to the admin mailing list 
&lt;URL:<A HREF="http://jos.org/pipermail/admin/1999-May/000067.html">http://jos.org/pipermail/admin/1999-May/000067.html</A>&gt;.
* Markus would you be able to put the wiki web source into the cvs 
repository?

Design:

* I believe it is starting to worry people that there are two 
different kernel development efforts taking place, JJOS by John 
Morrison and rjk by myself (Robert Fitzsimons).  I'm not to worried 
about it myself, I want JOS to be a plugable operating system at all 
levels.  This means even if the kernel and jvm are closely coupled as 
I believe is the case with JJOS and decaf (by Todd Miller), that is 
ok, as long as it is compatible at a different level, maybe the jvm 
and class library level.

Something else:

I also talked with gchii about a job his company are working on, for 
which a Java operating system would seem like the perfect based.  The 
problem is that he needs it now, not in year (maybe longer) for JOS 
to reach a proper stage of development.

So we talked about using the Linux kernel, the Blackdown port of 
Sun's JVM, and X Windows.  I'm starting to warm to this idea, it 
would allow development of the rest of the system (non kernel, jvm, 
drivers).

Now, how I would do this is, to use the Linux kernel for the kernel 
and drivers, Japhar as the jvm, Classpath as the class libraries, and 
the frame buffer support in the latest kernels or svgalib for 
graphics.  Does anybody want to work on this?

The next meeting will be on Sunday 6th of June 1999, at 17:00 UTC, on 
your local Undernet IRC server.
