<PRE>&gt;<i> discuss it with everyone first.  I am not sure that the corp understands
</I>&gt;<i> that we are an org, and what the difference is.  I don't see any trouble
</I>
I KNOW that the corp does NOT understand that we are an org.  I 
actually recieved that email from Mr. Tidwell first (it was sent to 
<A HREF="mailto:webmaster@jos.org">webmaster@jos.org</A>) and replied to him, trying to explain that we were 
an org, that we were an open-source movement (with appropriate links), 
and that any sort of &quot;business&quot; relationship would have to be voted on 
(or at least referred to &quot;someone in charge&quot;).  At the last point, I gave 
him the email address of the mailing list... Evidently, he only read the 
part about the mailing list, and just reposted the same darn message 
here.

&gt;<i> Anyway, what are y'alls comments on the proposal from Mr Dustin Tidwell of
</I>&gt;<i> Startpoint Corporation?
</I>
If they contribute to the code base, user base, or non-existant jos cash 
reserves, it seems like a good deal for jos.
