I know I dont, theres no point; most of the issues they bring up would slow us down (like we cant do that ourselves).
 
&gt;<i> If you have time, I'd really appreciate help reorganizing the Wiki.  The
</I>&gt;<i> project signup page is not organized well.  If you could try and

</I>&gt;<i> short description.  Right now, its pretty difficult to figure out exactly
</I>&gt;<i> what are the active jos projects...  You know, where actual code is

</I>&gt;<i> groups where ideas are being discussed and coding is optional).
</I>
This is what I attempted to do with JosReportCard although know one seemed to add there stuff (either that or we only have two projects only one with code!).
 
&gt;<i> The main wiki page could use some reorganization, and the jos irc
</I>&gt;<i> meeting announcement should probably be moved to a separate
</I>&gt;<i> JosAnnounce wiki page with only a one liner announcement and a link
</I>&gt;<i> to the times on the main wiki page.  *whew*
</I>
I miss the OldMain
 
&gt;<i> I have been looking over the original wiki site (the site where we got the
</I>&gt;<i> first copy of the wiki) and the way they keep things organized is they
</I>&gt;<i> have several self-appointed wiki organizers that just go around and clean
</I>&gt;<i> up pages, create &quot;meta-pages&quot; that basically summarize groups of
</I>&gt;<i> pages and provide links to them, and organize the links between pages
</I>&gt;<i> to make sense.  We (jos wiki) only seem to have people that create the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;leaf&quot; pages of the wiki.  We're missing the self-appointed organizers
</I>&gt;<i> that help to organize, summarize and arrange the wiki pages.   So if you
</I>&gt;<i> could, whenever you have the time, just start organizing when you see a
</I>&gt;<i> need, it would help a ton.  I think many members are reluctant to edit
</I>&gt;<i> other people's pages or create summaries which basically leaves a ton
</I>&gt;<i> of pages &quot;stranded&quot; with only a few links to them buried deep inside the
</I>&gt;<i> bodies of other pages...
</I>
Agreed, although this would be much easier if it was automated. Like adding a page to main/WorkingGroups/UserInterfaceGroup/ rather then adding a page to main/ then linking it to the
UserInterfacePage. And if on top of that tree structure you could navigate up and down pages automatically generated for each branch like:

 main/WorkingGroups contains: [up] [main] [help] [etc..]
     UserInterfaceGroup
     KernelGroup
     EtceteraEtcetera

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
