<PRE>Hi All;

(Sorry for the wide distribution, but I think this might be of general
interest.)

No, Todd and I have neither dropped dead nor given up.  So, what the
heck *have* we been up to, then?

(1)  We have re-written large segments of the guts of the JVM in order
to implement 64-bit Java types.  This involved substantial changes to
the representations of basic JVM objects.

(2) We have added an (incomplete) trace facility so you can watch the
Java opcodes run.

(3) We have fixed some bugs in the java array code.

(4) We have added &quot;#ifdef PARANOID&quot; subscript-checking array templates
which are now used throughout the code (e.g., the Java arrays).

(5) We have added inspector and mutator member functions to create
places one can set breakpoints to track down the places where
C++ instances get read/written (ah, to have a &quot;who calls&quot; facility).

(6) We have (incompletely) put in protection for member variables
(however, where we have done so, and where it is appropriate, we have
put in inspectors/mutators).

(7) We have (incompletely) put in &quot;const&quot; declarations.

(8) We have (incompletely) replaced explicit memory allocation calls
with C++ allocator calls (so constructors get fired up) so as to avoid
memory-initialization problems.

(9) We have (probably incompletely) inspected code to make sure
constructors actually initialize member variables to reasonable values.

(10) We have cleaned up lots of random things too numerous to mention.

(11) We have discussed coding conventions to enhance comprehensibility
of the code.

Currently in-process:

(1) We are reconciling our respective changes, and testing them a little
more thoroughly before committing the new sources to CVS.

(2) We are about to make some changes to the main JVM opcode-parsing
function to turn it into a method (probably) of the basic C++ class
which represents a Java thread.

(3) We are debating the &quot;right&quot; class hierarchy for java class
instances, java class objects, and java array objects (we think we're
converging).

Still to-do:

(1) We noticed that the basic 64-bit integer type we support is UNsigned
(whoops).  This needs to be changed for the java longs to work right.
If anybody feels so inclined, feel free to tackle this fairly
self-contained problem!

(2) We have discussed the relationship/identity of resolved vs.
unresolved Java classes, and we think we're converging on an approach.

(3) Sheesh, there are SO many other things, I'll just point you at the
&quot;doc/TODO&quot; file (once it's checked-in).

Sorry to be taking so long, but, hey, we're working as fast as we can
and yet still remain in good academic standing, employed, and married
(not necessarily in that order).

Very Truly Yours,

-jm
