<PRE>In article &lt;<A HREF="mailto:199905030202.CAA15872@vti.ie">199905030202.CAA15872@vti.ie</A>&gt; you wrote:
&gt;<i> Hi everybody

&gt;<i> We had a really good meeting today, we covered a lot, mainly stuff 
</I>&gt;<i> about the web site.
</I>
Sorry I missed it.

&gt;<i> Design:
</I>
&gt;<i> * I believe it is starting to worry people that there are two 
</I>&gt;<i> different kernel development efforts taking place, JJOS by John 
</I>&gt;<i> Morrison and rjk by myself (Robert Fitzsimons).  I'm not to worried 
</I>&gt;<i> about it myself, I want JOS to be a plugable operating system at all 
</I>&gt;<i> levels.  This means even if the kernel and jvm are closely coupled as 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe is the case with JJOS and decaf (by Todd Miller), that is 
</I>&gt;<i> ok, as long as it is compatible at a different level, maybe the jvm 
</I>&gt;<i> and class library level.
</I>
&gt;<i> Something else:
</I>
[snip]

&gt;<i> So we talked about using the Linux kernel, the Blackdown port of 
</I>&gt;<i> Sun's JVM, and X Windows.  I'm starting to warm to this idea, it 
</I>&gt;<i> would allow development of the rest of the system (non kernel, jvm, 
</I>&gt;<i> drivers).
</I>
&gt;<i> Now, how I would do this is, to use the Linux kernel for the kernel 
</I>&gt;<i> and drivers, Japhar as the jvm, Classpath as the class libraries, and 
</I>&gt;<i> the frame buffer support in the latest kernels or svgalib for 
</I>&gt;<i> graphics.  Does anybody want to work on this?
</I>
This is what i've been working on for the past week of so.  It's 
progressing slowly but surely - nothing really useable yet but it shows
great promise.  

Cheers
Geoff
