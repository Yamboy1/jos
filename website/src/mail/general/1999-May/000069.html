<PRE>Hi everybody

There is going to be an IRC meeting this Sunday the 6th of June 1999, 
at 17:00 UTC for two hours.  This meeting will taking place on the 
Undernet IRC Network.

I would like to discuss the following topics:
* The Constitution &lt;URL:<A HREF="http://jos.org/wiki/view/main/Constitution">http://jos.org/wiki/view/main/Constitution</A>&gt;, 
there should be a vote coming up on this soon.
* The Kernel Interface, I have updated the Kernel Interface, so that 
I should be able to start working on a JOS-Linux host soon.
* The plans for the next month.

Also, would anybody like to have a face-to-face meeting?  The story 
is that I was hoping to go to JavaOne but that isn't going to happen 
this (maybe next year ;).

But the company i'm working for says, I can have a free set of 
flights, so I was hoping to fly to the US (i'm in Mexico at the 
moment) and meet some of the others working on JOS.

The only problem I see is that the meeting would have to take place 
before the end of June.  But I wasn't thinking of anything big, just 
a couple of us meeting up for a few hours.

Also there isn't really a problem with where I go, so is there 
anybody up for this?
