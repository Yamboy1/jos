No, it seems to can do more according to the aj primer. E.g. &quot;automatic
composition&quot;.(I had no time to read+understand the full primer, I'm
going to dig through this this weekend)

The most important thing is to keep a certain grade of encapsulation,
IMHO AspectJ has to manage this... Could be done by Interfaces (? define
an interface for every object?). Sounds possible, but is AOP
(standalone) as powerful as OOP+AOP?

&gt;<i> It would not be too difficult to implement one since its main task is

</I>
It's one thing to compete with an existing product and another to
compete with Xerox PARC in developing a new programming paradigm. If at
all, IMHO we should concentrate in pushing the development of aj and or
in general the application of aop to java, so when the question of a
reimplementation comes we'd have a good product to reimplement.
