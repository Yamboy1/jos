<PRE>Hello,

I was working on a new front page for the web site and found that we 
don't have an Announce only mailing list!  Or do we and I just can't find 
it?  Or are we to use Vote-Info? I can see arguements that maybe 
admin or general fill this role but both lists have too much traffic (such 
as this one) that aren't really announcements.

Anyhow, it seems that we really need a separate read-only, low traffic 
announce mailing list.  Only major announcements from &quot;qualified 
people&quot; can post to this list.  People only vaguely interested in JOS 
(such as members of the press) or those that want to &quot;monitor&quot; jos 
without having to deal with any &quot;noise&quot; can use this list to keep tabs on 
JOS.  

Clark.  Can you set this up?  I can't see why there would be any 
objections unless an announce only list already exists and I wanted to 
get this new front page posted to the web asap.  Thanks.
