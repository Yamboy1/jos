Ok...  What i've been working on is the *absolute* minimum i386 based
linux system to be able to fully support a useable jvm execution environment.
This I figured would be enough to allow the real work to get going on
the Java OS part of JOS.  Basically I hope to have soon the absolute
linux basics (kernel, + enough support environment to run japhar or
the Blackdown JVM (probably japhar in the medium term) and svgalib or the 
newer framebuffer stuff).

Then what i'd like to see is the direct integration of the jvm into
an even further stripped down Linux kernel and some of this now hybrid linux
/ java kernel implemented into JJOS.  

From then on a synergistic approach to JJOS development and kernel reduction
should lead to a minimization of the Linux specific code and a nice clean
kernel support environment for JOS.

&gt;<i> I have in the past, not liked the idea of using and existing kernel 
</I>&gt;<i> and jvm.  But I have been turned around on this idea, i'm even 
</I>&gt;<i> willing to put my work on rjk on hold for a month or two, to work on 
</I>&gt;<i> this.  So lets see what we come up with.
</I>
I think we need to do whatever we can to maximize the use of 
our time and resources.
What i've actually got at the moment is pretty disorganized but I should be
able to put it into coherent order within a couple of weeks.  I'll put together
a brief document on how to create this minimal system and see how many
people get turned on.

Cheers

p.s. Sorry about the delay - I'll add my work address to the list so that
I can e-chat more frequently.
