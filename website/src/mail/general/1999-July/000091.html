<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm not sure. &quot;Tools&quot; makes me think of user tools, not tools used to build
</I>&gt;<i> programs. But maybe that's just me? :) (I'd be happy with it)
</I>
hmm, I always think of the disparate collection of various classes, beans, and applications I keep in my &quot;programers toolbox&quot;
 
&gt;<i> I'd prefer util.apps in that case (because it's a utility used to build apps).
</I>&gt;<i> org.jos.apps should only house actual application IMO, which the
</I>&gt;<i> ActionManager isn't.
</I>
good point.

&gt;<i> I'd be happy with an alternative name. I was never satisfied with
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ActionManager&quot;, but I couldn't come up with a better name. ActionUtility,
</I>&gt;<i> which is pretty good IMO, is already taken :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for GUIGenerator or GUITools... Hmm. I'd prefer the former over the
</I>&gt;<i> latter, although I don't think neither of them are right on target. But
</I>&gt;<i> they're probably better than ActionManager...
</I>
ActionGenerator?
 
&gt;<i> Any other suggestions?
</I>
Have it so you can generate from XML (I have a DTD for a &quot;ToolbarML&quot; I never used somewhere, if you are interested)

Cheers,
DigiGod

Quote of the Moment:
        Thus spake the master Ninjei:
         &quot;To the intelligent man, one word, to the fleet horse
          one whip, to the well-written program, a single
          command&quot;

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
O-
