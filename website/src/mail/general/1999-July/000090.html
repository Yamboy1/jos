Due to my E-Mail address giving me a hard time (*why* is it virtually
impossible to maintain a working permanent e-mail address?!?) I can't
reply to the messages directly, but I'll piece this one together with
the help of the archives :)

I'm not sure. &quot;Tools&quot; makes me think of user tools, not tools used to build
programs. But maybe that's just me? :) (I'd be happy with it)

&gt;<i>Or you could put it in:
</I>&gt;<i> org.jos.apps.util.actionmanager (or apps.tools)
</I>
I'd prefer util.apps in that case (because it's a utility used to build app=
s).
org.jos.apps should only house actual application IMO, which the
ActionManager isn't.

&gt;<i>. But ui.event.actionmanager
</I>&gt;<i> makes me think of event and listner classes,
</I>&gt;<i> not a toolbar builder
</I>
I agree.

</I>
As DigiGod correctly pointed out, the ActionManager is not at that &quot;level&quot;.
It builds menubars, toolbars and buttons (not, buttons are yet to be
implemented) from a text-based definition. It doesn't do any event handling,
except for those actions created by the action manager (it allows chaning of
event handling code during runtime for example).

Al also wrote:

&gt;<i> Ah, then maybe it should be renamed to GUIGenerator or GUITools or someth=
</I>ing
&gt;<i> like that?
</I>
I'd be happy with an alternative name. I was never satisfied with
&quot;ActionManager&quot;, but I couldn't come up with a better name. ActionUtility,
which is pretty good IMO, is already taken :)

As for GUIGenerator or GUITools... Hmm. I'd prefer the former over the
latter, although I don't think neither of them are right on target. But
they're probably better than ActionManager...

Any other suggestions?

I think it would be a good idea of have the name include &quot;action&quot;, because
the whole thing is centered around the actions (not the toolbars/menus). It
produces menus, but it's all primarily defined as a collection of actions.
It *could* be extended to support non-graphical user interfaces too. The on=
ly
Swing based class that is really *needed*, because of the interface, is the
Action class. The dependency on JMenuBar, JToolBar etc could easily be made
optional (in fact, it already is - you just don't define a MenuBar, and don=
't
define any icons for the actions).
