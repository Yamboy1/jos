<PRE>On the UI mailing list SeanCribbs brought up the idea of mapping Swing to AWT peers. the peers wouldn't point to JComponents but the ComponentUI's that draw them. this idea has complications:

After some research I am going to declare it feasible, of course its not simple (why cant it ever be simple?) its only one facet of making JOS graphic-able. Of course we must do it, and we might as
well do it right.

I want every UI and graphics person interested to do some reasearch and get together, on the UI list, to discuss what needs to be done and how to do it.

The keystone in all of this is the java.awt.Toolkit class, its easily replacable, but we need to do it carefuly and its going to have to tie into so many other things, the peer-ui maps being but a
tiny facet of that. Stuff like graphics and printing and clipboards and more are all there too.

I think to do this right we need to define some classes like Screen (the monitor or LCD where everythings shown) and JOSWindow that arent really part of the AWT or Swing and would only be used
internally (or by people who like to show off) one of the cool things about this is we can make the titlebar on frame swappable with the rest of the UI (on non-JOS computers and non-JOS L&amp;F's it would
be ignored) and of course we could just pass Screen's graphics2D to the screensavers (which would mean you could do anything with a JOSsaver as any other screensaver in anyother OS).

Well Im starting to ramble, always a good sign that I should stop writing. viva la org.jos.ui.JOSToolkit!

Cheers,
DigiGod

	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial

	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
