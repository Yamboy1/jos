<PRE>Max,

The Games group is not doing much of anything right now, but don't let that
fool you into thinking that JOS is dead.  In fact, JOS is about as alive now
as it has ever been, if not more so.  The current state of affairs is that a
lot of work is going on in the kernel, JVM, and drivers areas.  Just this
week, we saw the completion of our first VGA driver.  There is also
significant work going on defining core JOS services, such as JADE (a
command shell framework) and the Registry.  If you want to see how 'alive'
JOS is, subscribe to the 'arch', 'kernel' and 'ui' mailing lists.  With your
graphics interests, you might be suited to help write graphics drivers.  For
tech details, I strongly suggest subscribing to the 'kernel' list.  The
kernel writers are putting out status reports to that list every week or so.

Iain or Clark:  Could you make sure that Max has a wiki account?

Regards,
Avery J. Regier

</I>&gt;<i> Hi.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're the first person from JOS team from who I've received any mail (I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> counting automatic messages). I have registered with Wiki some time ago
</I>&gt;<i> (about
</I>&gt;<i> two weeks) and there was a message that 'you will receive a message which
</I>&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;<i> tell you what to do next'. I have never received such a message. I have
</I>&gt;<i> also
</I>&gt;<i> send a message to several people from JOS team (all of Graphics and Games
</I>&gt;<i> groups) - nobody answered. Is the whole project alive at all? I understand
</I>&gt;<i> that you don't know why those person didn't respond but all this gives
</I>&gt;<i> general
</I>&gt;<i> feeling that put me into doubt that there is a real work in the JOS.
</I>&gt;<i> My question to those persons was what follows, and I am writing to you in
</I>&gt;<i> hope
</I>&gt;<i> that I'll get some more information:
</I>&gt;<i> - where can I receive more information about JOS project - tech details
</I>&gt;<i> mostly. Exactly on what stage it is, what needs to be tested etc.
</I>&gt;<i> - how can I help? I am not very proficient with Java but I am working on
</I>&gt;<i> my
</I>&gt;<i> own project - a 3D modeler and I would surely help in Graphics and/or
</I>&gt;<i> Games
</I>&gt;<i> groups.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have registered a while ago. Just tell me, what to do now?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Greetings,
</I>&gt;<i> Max
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
