Subject: [JOS] Wiki update

Hello all,

The JOS wiki has been upgraded.  The new version
supports stricter rendering rules (should allow more freedome to write
what you want where you want it).  Basically, markups must be "stuck"
to words and surrounded by at least one space.
See http://jos.org/wiki/view/Wiki for more info.

In addition, the new wiki integrates version control into the
interface, and adds searching capabilities.  Please note that the
search abilities are currently pretty slow and resource intensive so if
you know your exact page name, please use the "Go" box instead of the
search form.  The wiki also supports categories for pages but I have
not exposed it until I've had a little more time to investigate it.

Any bug reports, comments, and improvement suggestions should be
emailed to me, webmaster@jos.org, or posted to the admin@jos.org list.

Sounds good. As long as no one else is using it already.

As for the action manager package: is everyone okay with
org.jos.ui.event.actionmanager? If so, I'll put it in
org.jos.experimental.peterschuller.event.actionmanager for now.

how about: org.jos.tools.actionmanager. I say this because we seem to have beans that arent applications and are to big to be called utilities (and would only be used by apps anyway), so we should put
them in tools. Or you could put it in: org.jos.apps.util.actionmanager (or apps.tools). But ui.event.actionmanager makes me think of event and listner classes, not a toolbar builder.

Yeah, but if it's part of the system really, then is should be in the
system packages. I would assume that ActionManager would be used by
system classes, too, right?

From its wiki page I infer it is just a tool for easy creation of menu/toolbars, its not like it manages the action events for the entire system.

Ah, then maybe it should be renamed to GUIGenerator or GUITools or
something like that?

Due to my E-Mail address giving me a hard time (*why* is it virtually
impossible to maintain a working permanent e-mail address?!?) I can't
reply to the messages directly, but I'll piece this one together with
the help of the archives :)

I'm not sure. "Tools" makes me think of user tools, not tools used to build
programs. But maybe that's just me? :) (I'd be happy with it)

>Or you could put it in:
> org.jos.apps.util.actionmanager (or apps.tools)

I'd prefer util.apps in that case (because it's a utility used to build app=
s).
org.jos.apps should only house actual application IMO, which the
ActionManager isn't.

>. But ui.event.actionmanager

I agree.

es,
> too, right?

As DigiGod correctly pointed out, the ActionManager is not at that "level".
It builds menubars, toolbars and buttons (not, buttons are yet to be
implemented) from a text-based definition. It doesn't do any event handling,
except for those actions created by the action manager (it allows chaning of
event handling code during runtime for example).

Al also wrote:

I'd be happy with an alternative name. I was never satisfied with
"ActionManager", but I couldn't come up with a better name. ActionUtility,
which is pretty good IMO, is already taken :)

As for GUIGenerator or GUITools... Hmm. I'd prefer the former over the
latter, although I don't think neither of them are right on target. But
they're probably better than ActionManager...

Any other suggestions?

I think it would be a good idea of have the name include "action", because
the whole thing is centered around the actions (not the toolbars/menus). It
produces menus, but it's all primarily defined as a collection of actions.
It *could* be extended to support non-graphical user interfaces too. The on=
ly
Swing based class that is really *needed*, because of the interface, is the
Action class. The dependency on JMenuBar, JToolBar etc could easily be made
optional (in fact, it already is - you just don't define a MenuBar, and don=
't
define any icons for the actions).

Have it so you can generate from XML (I have a DTD for a "ToolbarML" I never used somewhere, if you are interested)

Subject: [JOS] peer-ui mappings

On the UI mailing list SeanCribbs brought up the idea of mapping Swing to AWT peers. the peers wouldn't point to JComponents but the ComponentUI's that draw them. this idea has complications:

After some research I am going to declare it feasible, of course its not simple (why cant it ever be simple?) its only one facet of making JOS graphic-able. Of course we must do it, and we might as
well do it right.

I want every UI and graphics person interested to do some reasearch and get together, on the UI list, to discuss what needs to be done and how to do it.

The keystone in all of this is the java.awt.Toolkit class, its easily replacable, but we need to do it carefuly and its going to have to tie into so many other things, the peer-ui maps being but a
tiny facet of that. Stuff like graphics and printing and clipboards and more are all there too.

I think to do this right we need to define some classes like Screen (the monitor or LCD where everythings shown) and JOSWindow that arent really part of the AWT or Swing and would only be used
internally (or by people who like to show off) one of the cool things about this is we can make the titlebar on frame swappable with the rest of the UI (on non-JOS computers and non-JOS L&F's it would
be ignored) and of course we could just pass Screen's graphics2D to the screensavers (which would mean you could do anything with a JOSsaver as any other screensaver in anyother OS).

Well Im starting to ramble, always a good sign that I should stop writing. viva la org.jos.ui.JOSToolkit!

I just downloaded it and am going to take a look at it, although from the readme on your website I can tell we're going to have to do somethings differently.

the jos package is for things that require native code and the like, so lets put it in org.jos.ui.core[.peers?]

Subject: [JOS] PowerController, SystemEvent and JADE

Modern computers can be shutdown via the OS, JOS as a modern OS needs to
support this. A PowerController class would be a singelton that
interfaced to the kernel that lets you turn off the computer, reboot it,
put it in sleep mode, et al. the UI would have a shutdown action that
called the shutdownDialog that just called the PowerController. The OS
would have to tell every process, via a SystemEvent? (or a PowerEvent?)
to close. JADE would send a windowClosing event to all its frames, the
various components in JOS would shutdown (and serialize if applicable)
and then the computer would be told to shutdown

since PowerController dosent know what is in JOS (some of it being
dynamic, some of it being add ons or whatever) there should be a
[System|Power]Event of some sort that is sent to all its componenent and
applications (non-JOS stuff will have the legacy equiv. called by its
parent system (an app told to exit via its process).

basically the idea is PowerController is called by UI or other, it sends
events, stuff shutdown. computer goes night-night.

Subject: [JOS] Design

Its somewhat well agreed that we should split the design of the overall
OS into several sections:

JOSBox--JOSystem--Apps(including JADE) 

JOSBox is the virtual hardware, it consists of the real hardware, the
picokernel, and the JVM; its where all the native code is. A "windows
JOSBox" or a "linux JOSBox" can be made so JOS can be run on top of
another OS without having to modifiy it.

JOSystem is of two parts, JOSCore which is the absolute minimum required
for (and can be thought of a second, all java, kernel) JOS to be JOS
(including the generic extension mechanism for...) JOSExtensions which
will be grafted to JOS at runtime via JOSCore and will consist of things
that arent part of minimum JOS, but will include very common things too
(ie a file system). JOSCore holds process and security managers and via
its configuration metamechanism loads one predefined process only at
startup, the default for this being JADE (which the user can then launch
more apps from...)
 
Apps are what people use the OS for, the UI is an app. JADE is the UI,
it lets people run and interact with apps, it provides everything needed
for various types of UI's, like an AWT Toolkit for a GUI. JADE handles
the various process cycles of Apps so non-JOS apps dont have to worry
about it (or more importantly, be aware of).

Given that, we need to design the basic structure for these various
sections. we cant really do anything until we have a basic design, a
basic idea of what to do.  We should discuss what we need/want on our
various levels of expertise until we get a basic design to build off of
(JOS starts, it loads this which looks like that and then...)

lets get a crackin'

Cheers,
DigiGod

Hi Thomas (et al);

Well, I'm just glad it works!  Took long enough to get to this point,
didn't it?

(1) However, I confess I forgot (if I ever knew definitively) who's
doing the keyboard driver, and who's doing the VGA driver.

(2) With respect to drivers, there's the recurring issue of how to get
all this code written by all these different people to play together
nicely.  With the JVM, the interface spec was pretty well-defined (it
was the JVM spec -- not too much room for creativity there!).  Getting
the JVM and the pico/femto (whatever) kernel to play together nicely
only entailed Todd and I working together.  However, with the drivers,
and with the address spaces (etc.), things are pretty nebulous, and
there are a LOT more people involved.

I was thinking we could just reimplement the "JavaOS for Business" APIs,
which seem pretty well thought out to me.  There is a sort of "registry"
(which I know there's been a lot of discussion about on the JOS lists)
which unifies (as near as I can tell from the "Inside JavaOS" book) the
WIndoze-type registry, and the UNIX-type "device" hierarchy, and it
provides a mechanism for booting and device discovery, and even dynamic
device discovery (e.g., removable media), etc.  I'd be interested in
what people on the kernel list have to say about this.

Please be so kind as to open URL:
	http://jos.org/pipermail/admin/1999-July/000110.html
which discusses the issue, and respond to the kernel list.  There was no
response on the admin list.  (I'm also cc-ing the UI folk, because this
touches upon the VGA/SVGA/whatever driver issue, and I'm also cc-ing the
general list, because it's a general issue.)

Thanks,

-jm

Hello everybody

There will be an IRC meeting this Sunday the 1st of August, at 17:00 UTC
for about two hours.  The meeting will be taking place on the Undernet IRC
Network, in the #jos channel.

I have been very busy with work for the last couple of weeks (like
everybody else;), and won't be able to attend the meeting, so someone who
is attending please keep a log and send it me to be put up on the wiki
web.
