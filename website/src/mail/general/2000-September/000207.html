<PRE>Hello all,

OK.  I think we have somewhat of a consensus that JOS the organization &quot;as 
it is&quot; is broken.  At least, a bunch of yea's and no nay's.  I agree with 
everyone that the best new tactic will probably be a benevolent dictator or 
small cabal to provide much more focus and to get the ball rolling once again.

For the long term, I agree that a cabal is the best solution to avoid a 
variety of problems.  For the near term, just to &quot;make things happen&quot; and 
to really break from committee mode, it may not be a bad idea to actually 
target going with a transitional &quot;president&quot; who will act as the leader 
(delegating of course) for a defined and limited time period.  6 months 
seems reasonable.  As they say, there's nothing like having a dictator for 
gettin things done.  The end of that period will see a formal election of a 
cabal to replace the president (with a chairman so people can point fingers 
when someone says, &quot;who's in charge&quot;).

I am flattered that I've gotten votes to be the president.  And I will be 
willing to fill that role.  However, I think such a drastic change should 
at least be discussed as widely as possible amongst the jos membership to 
see if there is disagreement.  In addition, there should be a process for 
people to nominate other people as president candidates (including 
themselves).  Gee.  On the other hand, that sounds exactly like the process 
that is currently bogging down JOS in inactivity and loss of 
developers.  I'm a bit torn between &quot;fair&quot; and having things move 
expeditiously.

As far as the website and JSR's I think both are an excellent idea.  And 
they're critical to the re-org of JOS.  I'm currently looking for a new 
website home with an EJB server so we can do EJB/servlet development so the 
website can exploit all these java programmers we have!  :)

So the current big question is: should we be fair and go through a process, 
or just elect someone amongst us on the mailing list, and start making 
changes?  I'm currently leaning towards electing someone as a transitional 
&quot;president&quot; for 6 months to just get a &quot;shakedown&quot; going and reshape JOS as 
best as we can.  If this causes a problem (we get a large negative reaction 
from the membership) we go back and do it with the normal JOS voting 
procedure (a 2 month process as I recall).

So, votes for electing a 6 month transitional president: (+1 yes, 0 
abstain, -1 no)

My vote: +1

-iain
