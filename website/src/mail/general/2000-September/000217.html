Would you be interested in helping re-org our website?  I'm currently 
negotiating to get us web hosting with an ejb provider.  If that goes 
through, I was thinking of possibly redoing the jos site using jetspeed 
(java.apache.org - look at the jetspeed project).  That would get us back 
to java programming even for the website.  And it may make it much easier 
to expand the site since anyone can propose and submit new &quot;portlets&quot; to 
extend the site without requiring major site changes or access to the 
internals of the site.

Obviously a wiki portlet, news portlet (slashdot-ish), and documentation 
portlet (similar to php.net's annotated manual) would be the place to 
start.  After that, official member list/directory portlet, package name 
reservation system, JSR system, working group management portlets, etc, etc.

If you're not interested because its too close to what you do at work 
that's totally understandable!
