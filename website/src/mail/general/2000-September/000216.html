<PRE>OK!

It sounds like this is a go then.  I know its a rush so people away from 
their desks for a few days will probably dislike the haste but I feel its 
important to keep the momentum going.  In this spirit, we should definitely 
get this president issue concluded.  I agree that we can and should use the 
constitution since 2 weeks is fast enough (I forgot about ordinary votes 
which are so much shorter).

For those of you who aren't, subscribe to vote-info.  I'm going to whip up 
a vote proposal (on VoteInfo in the wiki) and post it to the wiki asap and 
officially start the voting procedure.  7 days from today, we'll hold the 
vote.  10 days after, we'll hopefully have a president and roadmap for the 
future.  Note, as is usual, the initial vote proposal is just that, a 
proposal and I hope very much that people will comment and help to tweak it 
before voting on it goes forward.
