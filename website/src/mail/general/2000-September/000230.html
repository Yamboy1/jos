Many academic organizations in Europe have a scheme of control that
could possibly assist us. Let me explain:


Council - 3 members - the Council is the &quot;top&quot; in the hierarchy, but is
only there to decide *general* policy, make public relations and (in the
case of funding) manage funds. They can agree or vote for decisions.

Senate - n members - the Senate is made up of JOS developers - they have
to be people who know about code and right code. These are the people
who, under the general guidelines of the council, take the technical and
implementation decisions for the project. They always vote for
decisions.

Court - everyone - everyone involved in project JOS that has the right
to access information regarding the development of JOS, propose ideas,
challenge proposals, comment, etc., but does not have the authoritative
power to change any decisions made by the Senate. People from the Court
can become members of the Senate in a way defined by us.


When we manage to define the aforementioned way, this scheme could work,
because we would have a &quot;head&quot; that guides the project on general, but
the actual decisions are made by the developers. The Council cannot
overrule a decision made by the Senate, but the Senate must work in
accordance to the general guidelines set by the Council.


Thoughts?
