For org details, it says we do need authoritarian methods.  This is simply 
because, for some things like writing checks or answering questions during 
interviews, someone has to actually do it on behalf of jos without a vote 
and every member participating.  ;)

I agree that dictatorships leave a lot of room for oppression.  But the 
question has come up if we can tolerate the inefficiencies of a true 
democracy or do we risk a dictatorship (which is much more efficient).  The 
hope is always that you get a &quot;benevolent dictatorship&quot; but its at the risk 
that you get a bad one which, being more efficient, can do a lot more damage.

The original discussion on the general mailing list essentially boiled down 
to: &quot;JOS, the organization, is broken and we should take some drastic 
measures to try and fix it.  The fix is an interim President.&quot;  (my 
interpretation)

Now, I'm getting the vibe that the mood is swinging back to: &quot;JOS, the 
organization, is broken but we can fix it without taking drastic measures 
like an interim President.&quot; (my interpretation)
