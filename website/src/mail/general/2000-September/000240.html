I disagree (that we don't need a much more focused group to provide new 
focus) but I'll play it out this way and see what happens if this is what 
poeple want.

&gt;<i>So here are my agenda items:
</I>&gt;<i>* Mailing list reorganization
</I>
As covered in another article, I think we should change to the following:

jos-announce - low traffic (twice a month or once a week) Major 
announcements only
jos-dev - developers and voting occur here
jos-user - general discussions, user issues, etc

This requires changing the Policy book to point to the jos-dev list instead 
of the vote-info list.  I don't think this requires a vote.  It's 
administrative minutia.

We should make an announcement of the fact that a change has occured though 
on the announce list when that's in place.  I also recommend that we put 
all lists together (right now announce is still at spin isn't it?)  In 
addition, the archives from all old lists (and they're scattered all over 
the place) should be consolidated and put into an archive on our website.

Finally, since we're changing the list names, I also suggest hosting the 
lists on sourceforge.  One less piece of net infrastructure to maintain, 
fix, update, and backup.

&gt;<i>* Web site reorganization
</I>
I have just gotten the agreement from <A HREF="http://www.ejip.net/">http://www.ejip.net/</A> to donate web 
hosting for us!  Servlets and ejb's and a jdbc database are now usable to 
build our website.  We just need to give them the word and we can have an 
account activated for us.

As soon as feasible, I'd really appreciate it if people could suggest 
approaches to take here.  Now that its java, I'm hoping to get more help 
with constructing the website... :)  Jetspeed and Enhydra is still my 
leading options but I'm willing to hear alternative suggestions for 
technology.  I'll be posting my outline of the new website (features, etc) 
later this week or early next week.

&gt;<i>* Produce a status report
</I>
This should probably be done once the change is in progress?  I was writing 
up one of the current state but there really wasn't much to put in it.

&gt;<i>* How we develop code
</I>&gt;<i>* Chose a license for JOS
</I>&gt;<i>* Which organizational structure
</I>
For these three, should we just put up a proposal and then let people tweak it?

&gt;<i>* Setting up a non-profit entity
</I>
I think this is a bit more overhead than we can handle right now.  Of 
course if someone has the time and inclination, we'd love to get this 
process started but I can't really start this now and I haven't heard 
anyone else volunteer to do this.  I propose putting this on the backburner 
until all the other major issues are taken care of.
