</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Hi everybody
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I hope to have a very important IRC meeting this coming Sunday the 1st
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;of October 2000, at 17:00 UTC for about two hours.  This meeting will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;take place on the Undernet IRC Network, in the #jos channel.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;There is only item I would like to discuss:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;* How we are handling the current JOS reorganization
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I would hope that most of the people involved in the current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;discussions on the mailing list would try and attend.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think this is one of the problems with the way JOS is run. You choose to
</I>&gt;<i>undertake an action that will isolate members who can't attend. Why not
</I>&gt;<i>have discussions on the mailing lists instead ? This way it is archived
</I>&gt;<i>better and allows more people to participate.
</I>
My personal opinion is that mailing list discussions tend to take too long 
and go off on threads too easily.  The chat meetings usually are nice in 
that they get decisions made much quicker.  I do sympathize with your 
position though.  Perhaps it would be best to do these things over the 
mailing list if we can figure out a way to make it move quicker.  Any 
suggestions?

ps - I think it will go faster if we use the simple developer voting scheme 
I've been pushing.  I've seen small and large decisions made quickly on 
lists that use that technique.
