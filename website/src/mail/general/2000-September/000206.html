ug - anything but a single head. I have seen sooo many projects die off
because the head decides they are bored with project or has too little time
to give to it. It is necessary for leadership but it should a group of some
sort whether its a senate, a council, a cabal or whatever - just people
whos main concern is the good of jos. People can step down from it or get
nominated to ascend but only if they have good of project in mind.

You should make sure that the council can always &quot;close&quot; a vote - ie don't
have an even number of people - make sure in cases of equality that the
absenting voters are forced to vote - or are allowed to propose another take.

&gt;<i>Let's take licensing ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Many many moons ago I stopped working with JOS because I became exhausted
</I>&gt;<i>over the licensing thing, which kept coming up, and up, and up. And still
</I>&gt;<i>keeps coming up. Etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>JUST ADOPT THE LGPL, THE GLP, THE NLP, THE MPL, OR WHATEVER.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Just say &quot;its going to be this way.&quot; Period. If it makes the monarch's job
</I>&gt;<i>any easier, they can feel better ask the three or four guys who's code they
</I>&gt;<i>respect the best: hey, should we go GPL or LGPL or what? And then RESPECT
</I>&gt;<i>their opinion. And then just put your foot down and say its going to be
</I>&gt;<i>this way or that. Discussion? Okay. Two days of discussion and THEN I make
</I>&gt;<i>the overruling binding decision. Everyone speak up. Personally, if I don't
</I>&gt;<i>like the way licensing works I'll go somewhere I do. Fine. If you want tons
</I>&gt;<i>of people choose LGPL. Just CHOOSE.
</I>
yep I reckon anything is better than nothing :P

&gt;<i>Anyone who doesn't like it will leave. Fine. Those who stay will have the
</I>&gt;<i>comfort of strong decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is all old-fashioned leadership stuff. Some one person needs to stand
</I>&gt;<i>up and take charge.
</I>
Not stand up and take charge - hopefully a group elected by those here that
are committers. Say you have a council of 3 - make sure the votes are taken
and these three are given power to enact any changes - ie make them able to
make everyone GPL or MPL or BSD or X or Y. Make them able to decide where
copyright should be assigned etc

Cheers,

Pete
