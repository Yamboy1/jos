<PRE>+1 for electing a president

&gt;<i>Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>OK.  I think we have somewhat of a consensus that JOS the organization &quot;as 
</I>&gt;<i>it is&quot; is broken.  At least, a bunch of yea's and no nay's.  I agree with 
</I>&gt;<i>everyone that the best new tactic will probably be a benevolent dictator 
</I>&gt;<i>or small cabal to provide much more focus and to get the ball rolling once 
</I>&gt;<i>again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>For the long term, I agree that a cabal is the best solution to avoid a 
</I>&gt;<i>variety of problems.  For the near term, just to &quot;make things happen&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i>to really break from committee mode, it may not be a bad idea to actually 
</I>&gt;<i>target going with a transitional &quot;president&quot; who will act as the leader 
</I>&gt;<i>(delegating of course) for a defined and limited time period.  6 months 
</I>&gt;<i>seems reasonable.  As they say, there's nothing like having a dictator for 
</I>&gt;<i>gettin things done.  The end of that period will see a formal election of 
</I>&gt;<i>a cabal to replace the president (with a chairman so people can point 
</I>&gt;<i>fingers when someone says, &quot;who's in charge&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I am flattered that I've gotten votes to be the president.  And I will be 
</I>&gt;<i>willing to fill that role.  However, I think such a drastic change should 
</I>&gt;<i>at least be discussed as widely as possible amongst the jos membership to 
</I>&gt;<i>see if there is disagreement.  In addition, there should be a process for 
</I>&gt;<i>people to nominate other people as president candidates (including 
</I>&gt;<i>themselves).  Gee.  On the other hand, that sounds exactly like the 
</I>&gt;<i>process that is currently bogging down JOS in inactivity and loss of 
</I>&gt;<i>developers.  I'm a bit torn between &quot;fair&quot; and having things move 
</I>&gt;<i>expeditiously.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As far as the website and JSR's I think both are an excellent idea.  And 
</I>&gt;<i>they're critical to the re-org of JOS.  I'm currently looking for a new 
</I>&gt;<i>website home with an EJB server so we can do EJB/servlet development so 
</I>&gt;<i>the website can exploit all these java programmers we have!  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So the current big question is: should we be fair and go through a 
</I>&gt;<i>process, or just elect someone amongst us on the mailing list, and start 
</I>&gt;<i>making changes?  I'm currently leaning towards electing someone as a 
</I>&gt;<i>transitional &quot;president&quot; for 6 months to just get a &quot;shakedown&quot; going and 
</I>&gt;<i>reshape JOS as best as we can.  If this causes a problem (we get a large 
</I>&gt;<i>negative reaction from the membership) we go back and do it with the 
</I>&gt;<i>normal JOS voting procedure (a 2 month process as I recall).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So, votes for electing a 6 month transitional president: (+1 yes, 0 
</I>&gt;<i>abstain, -1 no)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My vote: +1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>-iain
</I>&gt;<i>
