<PRE>As I was instrumental in getting our Constitution set up, I have a certain
feeling that we shouldn't try to contravent it so easily.  It was set up so
that there is a clear procedure for settling disagreements and ratifying
binding decisions.  Such a drastic change as this, should at least
reasonably abide by the Constitution.

According to the Constitution, the minimum that we could have an elected
President would be 17 days.  7 days to advertise the vote and 10 days for
the actual voting to take place.  That is if we define this as an 'ordinary'
vote that doesn't change the Constitution.  This will settle point 1 below.
We can then figure out how we want to change the Constitution to set up the
'cabal'.  That vote will require 14+20 days.

The biggest problem with such a vote are points 4.10-12 of the Constitution.
They state that there can only be three possible votes:  yes, no, and
neither.

In order to reasonably keep this vote within the Constitution, I propose to
word the vote as follows:
	The JOS Project shall be led by a President.  The President shall
have the power to: [whatever powers we wish to grant]
	Please vote [yes/no/neither]:

	Reason for Neither vote:


	If this vote passes with a 'yes' vote, I elect the following person
to the position of President: 
	A&gt; Iain
	B&gt; Someone else.
	C&gt; etc.

The nominations for President can take place on the vote-info list during
the 7 day advertisement period.

In order for this to happen, we need a neutral administrator of the vote, a
person to propose the vote, and a seconder.  All of the above people need to
be members of the vote-info list.  If we figure out what powers the
President should have, we can start the procedure immediately and have a
President within 20 or so days.

What is above is the qualification on my +1.

Regards,
Avery J. Regier

	+1 as well


	I don't really mind who will be the president (as long as he is from
	this list and contributes, and we all know who are the people that
	contribute - and if not, we can run a statistical analysis on the
	archives of the list). Also, if there will be a group that has
control
	over JOS, I would be interested in the responsibility myself (but
not
	president or anything close to as high).


	May I point out a few things that I think we should do?


	1) Find a procedure that will enable us in the immediate future
	(something like, say, two weeks?) to select who will be the ultimate
	ruler of JOS right now.

	2) Find a procedure that will enable us in the near future (how
about
	two months?) to select a team that will be the rulers of JOS.

	3) Use this team to establish JOS policy in all aspects.

	4) Create an all new web site for JOS.

	5) For groups, delegate works and start producing and integrating.
