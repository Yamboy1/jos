<PRE>Hi Iain, all

&gt;<i>  From the way the current discussions are going, I have the feeling that 
</I>&gt;<i> many core members (as measured by activity both on the lists and in 
</I>&gt;<i> development) are not interested in throwing away the current  
</I>&gt;<i> organization structure.  This is an inherently dangerous situation as some 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;active&quot; members do want to go through a restructuring and so its hard to 
</I>&gt;<i> make those that want to throw out the old rules follow the old rules.  ;)
</I>
The problem isn't with the current rules [1], it's with the lack of focus
and direction.  Now we don't need a president to to give us this focus,
this was the change of heart on my part.

What we need to do is treat this mailing list like a IRC meeting, we
need to set the agenda items, discuss them, and make decisions.  Any
decisions that are too important will need to be voted on and
constitution updated, etc.

The hard part will be to keep the discussion going and on-topic, but
thats not too hard when there are a number of people involved.

So here are my agenda items:
* Mailing list reorganization
* Web site reorganization
* Produce a status report
* How we develop code
* Chose a license for JOS
* Which organizational structure
* Setting up a non-profit entity
* Anything else I've left out

So add you agenda items.  I don't really mind the order we discuss
these in, but doing the easiest first would probably be the best.

&gt;<i> VOTE:
</I>&gt;<i> \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
</I>&gt;<i> So can I get an inpromptu vote:  How many people want to keep JOS as-is 
</I>&gt;<i> and/or feel that any changes must be made through the processes outlined in 
</I>&gt;<i> the constitution.  (+1 yes, +/-0 abstain, -1 no).
</I>
+1
Basically in the longterm we need to reorganize, but lets just do it a
bit more slowly and *within the constitution*.

1.  The current rules (Constitution and Policy Book) only set out the
aims and how to vote on issues, and thats about it.
