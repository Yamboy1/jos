<PRE>Formation of the Ad Hoc Constitutional Committee 2000, nicknamed Section 5.

Section 5 is an Ad Committee, and therefore no formal mechanism exists to
promote, restrain, or encumber its formation. It is not a violation of the
JOS Constitution or JOS 

The mission of the AHCC 2000 consists of the following major objectives:

1) To draft a recommendation for an extraordinary change to the JOS
Constitution, Section 5, JOS Governance Procedures.
2) To review the recommendations with the JOS Membership in order to take
into account all issues brought forth.
3) To edit the recommendations with regards to the input received.
4) To advertise the recommendation under the extraordinary rules for a vote
by JOS Membership.
5) To further steward the recommendation through the JOS voting procedures.

Once these five major objectives have been me the AHCC 2000 will dissolve
with no further ado.

No qualifications for Section 5 membership have been determined at this time.

The contents of the recommendation that Section 5 is drafting would
include, but not be delimited to:

1) The institutionalization of a temporary Constitutional President (CP),
who would hold office six months out of the year.
2) The definition of the CP's roles, responsibilities, powers, constraints,
etc.
3) The institutionalization of a temporary Presidential Oversight Committee
(POC), which would balance and check the power and control of the
Constitutional President, but would operate year round.
4) The definition of the POC's roles, responsibilities, powers,
constraints, etc.
5) The rules and procedures by which the POC oversees the executive power
of the CP.

I do not offer the actual text of the Section 5 recommendation ... I think
this should be a group process, and recommend we continue further
discussions on Section 5 on <A HREF="mailto:general@jos.org.">general@jos.org.</A> I encourage all members to
participate, and provide their valuable input in a timely manner. I
recommend Section 5 discussion end in a timely manner, and the matter drawn
up and advertised for a full vote.

For your convenience, some relevant sections of the JOS Constitution
concerning the extraordinary nature of this measure.
