<PRE>Hi all.

Gilbert sent this to me.  He's not subscribed to general so he's not up to 
speed with the rest of the thread.  I assume he came across the vote 
proposal and fired this off to me.  I'm reposting it here with his 
permission.  I'll try and respond to it via the list.

</I>&gt;<i>To: Iain Shigeoka &lt;<A HREF="mailto:iainshigeoka@yahoo.com">iainshigeoka@yahoo.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>From: Gilbert Carl Herschberger II &lt;<A HREF="mailto:gchii@mindspring.com">gchii@mindspring.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>Subject: JOS President??? No way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Look at the constitution of the JOS Project which has been accepted by most
</I>&gt;<i>members of the JOS Project. There is no provision for the office of
</I>&gt;<i>president. There can be no president of the JOS Project unless the
</I>&gt;<i>constitution makes room for it. Only the constitution can define the role
</I>&gt;<i>of a president.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Nominating a president and voting on it is outrageous. It may be a
</I>&gt;<i>misguided attempt to fix the public relations problems of an open source
</I>&gt;<i>and free license project. While you are working hard to make the JOS
</I>&gt;<i>Project succeed, I think you're going about it the wrong way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Start a legal organization of your own. Call it something else. If you want
</I>&gt;<i>to start your own organization with yourself as president, there is no
</I>&gt;<i>problem. If your organization is dedicated to promote the JOS Project,
</I>&gt;<i>there is no problem. If you want to link the JOS Project and your
</I>&gt;<i>organization together, there is no problem. But, your organization /is not/
</I>&gt;<i>the JOS Project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>None of the members of the JOS Project are employees. None of them are
</I>&gt;<i>under contract. The JOS Project is not a non-profit organization. It is an
</I>&gt;<i>open source project. No member is required to follow a &quot;president&quot; anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>Anyone acting as &quot;president&quot; is acting on their own. Claiming to be
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;president&quot; when there can be no president destroys the credibility of the
</I>&gt;<i>JOS Project as an open source initiative.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>No contract signed by such a &quot;president&quot; is legally binding on any member
</I>&gt;<i>of the JOS Project. It might be binding on members of your own organization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>No license expedited by such a &quot;president&quot; is legally binding on any source
</I>&gt;<i>code added to the JOS Project umbrella. In no way does a JOS License
</I>&gt;<i>supercede the license chosen by its original author. A vote for a
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;president&quot; is a hollow and misleading victory. It accomplishes nothing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>To use your priviledges as webmaster to announce your candidacy for
</I>&gt;<i>president might be considered an abuse of power. You need to step back and
</I>&gt;<i>look at what you're doing. The JOS Project doesn't own anything. It is not
</I>&gt;<i>a legal entity. No one person can speak on behalf of its members. It
</I>&gt;<i>doesn't need a president.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Using the JOS Project mailing list to conduct a vote for president is
</I>&gt;<i>contrary to the constitution. First of all, the constitution must be
</I>&gt;<i>ammended to create a presidential office. If that vote succeeds, rules for
</I>&gt;<i>the office of president must be adopted in the same way. The constitution
</I>&gt;<i>has provision for this already.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Have you become so impatient? Why is that? Please don't get ahead of
</I>&gt;<i>yourself. You should work with individual authors as I have done. Only the
</I>&gt;<i>jJOS/decaf subproject has moved to SourceForge, not the JOS Project. People
</I>&gt;<i>sometimes forget themselves because they want something so much. Don't let
</I>&gt;<i>that happen to you.
</I>
