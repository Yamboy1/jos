Well, that's the beauty of the Wiki.  You put up a page and let others 
tweak and maintain it.

Yes, this is very interesting.  It's always been my opinion that, 
practically speaking, user security beyond a very simple scheme will always 
fall prey to poor password choice and other user failings long before the 
need to resort to attacks on the security system itself.  It's amazing how 
many people will send you their password if you just send them an email 
asking for it.  That being said, the OS should provide the best user 
security possible so that users that are security savvy will be 
protected.  The concept of a user in java though is also a new concept 
(java-wise) that needs to be worked out in JOS.
