You are quite correct in guessing what I had in mind. After developing
the Registry API (inverted tree like structure) I thought of this
scheme. The registry supports merging and synchronization, and it can
run seamlessly in distributed applications, or many concurrent user
sessions.

&gt;<i> The problem with this is that it interferes with multiple logins.

Not really... As long as there is at least one active session, no
encryption and saving to the disk will be made (unless, of course, for
matters of caching, buffering, etc., etc.). When all sessions of a
specific user have been terminated or died (network time-out, for
example), then the user's profile is considered &quot;inactive&quot; and will be
securely stored to disk (or whatever other medium).

&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt; I believe any &quot;profile&quot; data should be accessed directly on
</I>&gt;<i> disk (or wherever the &quot;authorative&quot; copy resides).
</I>
Indeed, and with my model it will be so, just that there will exist a
transparent layer between user application and user profile data on
disk: secure encryption. That is part of the system, and as I suggested
in my original e-mail, I would be happy if this was done at file system
level - system core at the most. Not even administrators should have
access to this, on the VM and the JOS security monitor.
