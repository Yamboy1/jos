<PRE>Hi everybody

Around this time of the year three years ago on the old JavaLobby
forums, the idea of creating an operating system based on the Java
programming language was discussed, out of this discussion the JOS
project started.

Now over those years the JOS project has remained quite small with the
number of active contributes staying about the same.  But interest is
still quite high with new people joining all the time, but there has
been just as many leaving as joining.  I believe this is because there
has been very little progress as a group, although some individuals have
made quite a bit of progress.

Now I have always promoted the idea of there being multiple
implementation of every component.  With the best being chosen by
natural selection, but this hasn't worked each component is too strong
and just won't die.  The problem with this is that the whole project
will die off because new members don't know where to start and then
leave.

So far each developer has worked on there own project with little help
from other developers, and nobody wants to give up there project and
work on someone else's.

Now for this to change we need to all stop working on our own projects
and work together on a new unified project.  We should treat all the
current project as prototypes and leave them behind, and just bring all
the good ideas with us on the new unified project.

For this to succeed we need to jump into the deep-end, new mailing
lists, web site, cvs server.  We can keep the old stuff around but only
for reference.

So what do we all think, comments, flames, ideas, are all welcomed.
