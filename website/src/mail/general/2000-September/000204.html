okays :P

Theres a certain amount of consolidating occuring at Jakarta apache
project. They are slowly aquiring projects that should fulfill all your
java orientated building needs.

Currently it has a build tool (Ant), they are moving JUnit to it (Unit
testing framework), as well as a logging framework (either log4j or one of
a few other potentials), they have general regular expression libs (both
ORO and regexp) etc. They are still missing a few tools (code
formatter/beautifier, installshield) but mostly they will aquire them
eventually. Combine that with the Bean Scripting Framework (OSS from IBM
that acts as interface engine for some of javascript, python interpreters)
and you have a complete build envionment. They also have all tools to build
documentaion from XML sources.

So they are good places to at least start looking also look at
www.jpython.org and www.mozilla.org for nice scipt engines.

&gt;&gt;<i>Another thing to consider is making consistency across all the projects.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Currently copyright is assigned to various people and licensing is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>different etc. It is much better to assign copyright to a non-profit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>organisation as that means if the owner of code leaves the rest of team are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>not screwed. You could look for a sponsor group if you don't want problems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>of setting up jos.org - there are a few around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yup.  Copyright has always been a problem with JOS.  I've always leaned 
</I>&gt;<i>towards a BSD license but we could never agree on anything.  Once again, 
</I>&gt;<i>this is probably mostly a matter of biting the bullet and doing 
</I>&gt;<i>this.  There are core developers that will get pissed off and leave no 
</I>&gt;<i>matter what decision is made though which is why the decision has never 
</I>&gt;<i>been made.
</I>
I guess you will always loose people but you will also gain people by
consolidating. It may even be worth having a split license - GPL/LGPL for
jvm/os/classlibraries. BSD for execution environment and the rest - this
will allow you the most reuse as most JVMc/classlibraries are GPL and most
other stuff on top of that isn't. 

&gt;&gt;<i>Personally I don't think a Wiki approach is the *right* approach - at least
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>not for this. It is too damn hard to maintain, manage, navigate and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>standardize.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>+1  This is slated to change as soon as I can get the time.  See the mockup 
</I>&gt;<i>at jos.sourceforge.net and send me a comment via email if you hate/like 
</I>&gt;<i>it.  The content is really poor at the moment because I was just testing 
</I>&gt;<i>out the look and feel.
</I>
I always like a navigation aid down the side that is large and hierarchial
so you know exactly where you are other than that I like :P

&gt;&gt;<i>BTW if you are standardising projects structure you may want to wait until
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>end of november as I am trying to get a standard layout that all projects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>conform to defined at Apache. If that is the case then it will slowly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>trickle out - many of the other java projects rely on Apache tools and will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>gradually conform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That's great.  Can you ping the list when that's ready so we can eval it?
</I>
yep :P

good luck with whatever you decide and if you decide something I am
comtable with maybe I will join up :P
Cheers,

Pete
