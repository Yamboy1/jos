I think its a great approach but too much work for us.  We're having 
trouble keeping people involved without any more over head.  If JOS 
actually had a functional system, then I can see how this organization 
would really help.  And I think we really should be actively thinking about 
how to set this up.  But practically speaking I don't think we have the 
number of developers needed to really need this.

In all honesty, I think we really just need a few really bull-headed people 
to take this thing by the horns and set a direction for the group.  The 
number one problem seems to be lack of ownership.  The project started out 
as a committee idea and so no one person is &quot;THE DESIGNER&quot;.  And most of us 
are a bit too polite and cautious to really just take the reigns.  I'd 
really like to see someone just say, I'm officially JOS Desktop and I say 
JOS is linux + Xwindows + kaffe + JOS Desktop (a java window manager) and 
then design it, recruit helpers, and build it.  And someone else to say, 
I'm officially JOS Kernel and I say JOS is decaf + jjos + classpath.  In 
addition, I think we have people that could and would do that already, but 
most of them are just too busy with other things to be able to be that person.

&gt;<i> &gt; For this to succeed we need to jump into the deep-end, new mailing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lists, web site, cvs server.  We can keep the old stuff around but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only for reference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is a good idea. The Wiki is useful, but there is no real
</I>&gt;<i>organization strength behind it. The versioning must be made where and
</I>&gt;<i>when it is useful. A hierarchy of information must be created. We need
</I>&gt;<i>to separate news, discussion, reading material and implementation. The
</I>&gt;<i>Wiki seems a bit too chaotic to serve such a huge project as an OS.
</I>
Yes.  This is part of the web update suggestion already in the queue.  I 
think its already been &quot;approved&quot; in that we discussed in during the jos 
meetings and everyone gave it a +1.  The task should naturally fall on me 
but I've been very busy at work and spending all my limited spare time 
trying to stay away from the computer!  :)

I promise to address it soon though.

&gt;<i>Regarding leaving all behind, I would just like to point out that all
</I>&gt;<i>user-level applications should not be left out, but continue being
</I>&gt;<i>listed. User-level applications do not hinder the development of the
</I>&gt;<i>underlying OS, nor do they complicate the API's (they are not API's -
</I>&gt;<i>you see).
</I>
Agreed.  The current tactic I would propose is to tell every one to create 
separate SourceForge projects, that link back to JOS.  JOS's website will 
create a link directory going back to the individual sourceforge 
projects.  Sound reasonable?
