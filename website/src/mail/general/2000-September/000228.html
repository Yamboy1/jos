<PRE>Hi all

After thinking about it I think we need to stop this vote.  I think
we're rushing it, we need to do this right.  We need to turn the project
around, but lets not do it too fast, people need time to adjust.

I don't think we need a president to change things, we just need someone
to help guides us in the right direction.  Think of how Iain and myself
have run the IRC meetings, we set an agenda, the discuss the topics, if
the discussion goes off-topic we try and bring it back on topic.  Almost
always the out come of the meeting has been good, with most of the
issues getting solved.

There is nothing in the responsibilities that needs the extraordinary
powers we want to grant (thought I don't think Iain would abuse them),
so lets not give them out.
