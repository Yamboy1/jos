Correct.  But as far as making that a membership quality it seems pretty 
lame.  I can see people wanting to be members that don't want to be on the 
list and the other way around.  I think membership should be a web 
database.  Part of the new site.  So you fill out a form, and you are 
entered as member.  Another removes you from being a member.

As my above comment states.  I think mailing lists and membership need to 
be separate things for exactly this reason amongst others.

&gt;<i>2) If all you want to do is find a consensus of active developers, without
</I>&gt;<i>making a vote binding or official, then you can use the +1 type vote on the
</I>&gt;<i>'dev' list for that without going through an official Constitutional vote.
</I>&gt;<i>The Constitution doesn't prevent that.
</I>
So that means developers will need to be politicians and that once JOS has 
enough members (people interested in it by say using it) you'll never be 
able to make a decision.  Say developers want to rewrite the kernel in 
cobol.  They'd have to have everyone (or the majority in any case) that's a 
JOS member approve.  This starts to look unwieldy if we had a membership 
the size of say Java Lobby...
