Eww.  OK.  I'd actually like to use it especially because its an apache 
project and it looks like it has a lot of potential.  However, I'm short on 
time and speed is of the essence.  So maybe jetspeed should be a website 
2.0 thing and we should try something else... a custom portal based on 
enhydra perhaps.  Any suggestions for the quickest servlet based portal 
solution?

I'm mostly interested in a system that allows us to quickly and easily put 
up an ordered set of documentation with the concept of multiple &quot;authors&quot; 
and &quot;editors&quot;.  This is similar to midgard but in java.
