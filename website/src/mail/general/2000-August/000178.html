<PRE>Hi All

Well i've been in Chicago for almost six months now, and for four month
I was living in a hotel.  Also for the first month I had no access to
the internet (I don't know how I didn't kill myself ;), and no access to
a computer outside of work.

Since I got my laptop I haven't had access to a second computer to test
with i've been unable to get much work done on RJK, so over the last few
months i've been working on a JVM.

My goals for this JVM are to allow the running of multipule Java
Processes inside the one JVM, share as much class information as possible
between Processes, and be small and fast.

I followed the discussions on the arch mailing list about sharing data
between Processes.  But i'm not sure if I realy like the out come of that
discussion, although I did like some of the ideas.  But i've drawn from
ideas used by lots of JVM, i.e. Japhar, Chives, etc.

My current code base is written in ANSI C and runs on Linux, though this
may change soon.  The code is currently able to parse a classfile into
the internal format used by my JVM, and i'm currently working on having
the Java bytecode converted to native code (ake JIT compiler).

I've been taking my time with this and i've completely rewritten in about
three times so far.  I don't plan to release it yet as I want it to be
able to excute some code first, although previous code bases were able
to interpret some code until they reached a native method.

I also think i'm going to releasing my code under GPL, so if anybody has
a problem with this now would be a good time to discuss it.

Once the JVM is able to excute most code i'll proably go back and work
on RJK.

That about it for the moment.
