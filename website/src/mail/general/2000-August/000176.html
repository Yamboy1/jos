<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Is there anybody who would like an IRC chat this weekend?  I've got a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; lot of free time and no TV, so I need something to do. ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I don't own a TV which means I have a TON of free time... I wish I 
</I>&gt;<i> did.  Somehow even without a TV I manage to have way too much to do!  :)
</I>
Don't take this to mean I need a TV (but it would be nice ;), but i'm
now living in Chicago, with no family, friends, TV, or car to keep me
busy.  So all I have to keep me busy is work and, my laptop and cable modem.

&gt;<i> It would be nice to put together an agenda if we have any important topics 
</I>&gt;<i> to discuss.  Of course, if we go that far, we might as well make it an 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;official JOS meeting&quot;.  Shall we set a day/time so I can announce it on 
</I>&gt;<i> the jos website?  I was also thinking it wouldn't be a bad idea to restart 
</I>&gt;<i> the monthly JOS meetings if we can get a big enough group to attend.
</I>
Sure lets put together an agenda, i'll send an updated of what i've been
working on over the last number of month later on today.

&gt;<i> I personally do have an agenda I'd like to promote:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. State of the Union - It would be nice to create a JOS quarterly report 
</I>&gt;<i> or at least discuss the current state of JOS.  I have a vague idea of 
</I>&gt;<i> what's going on but it would be nice to get other people's impressions/input.
</I>
Yes, we really need this.  It's be a long time since the last quarterly
(yearly) report.

&gt;<i> 2.  JOS.org - creation of an official legal non-profit entity to enable 
</I>&gt;<i> fund raising and to formulate agreements/partnerships etc on behalf of the 
</I>&gt;<i> JOS project.  This was discussed as a &quot;Good Thing To Do (tm)&quot; a few weeks 
</I>&gt;<i> ago on the admin list.  Funds can be used to defray costs which are 
</I>&gt;<i> currently coming out of JOS member pockets, and perhaps sponsor 
</I>&gt;<i> trips/meetings/conferences, etc.  I guess ultimately, we may even be able 
</I>&gt;<i> to do something like FreeBSD and hire a minimal full time staff of 
</I>&gt;<i> programmers to work on JOS full time.  The timing is good because of point 3.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  Sponsorship - pushing forward, Etoolz (the company I work for) has 
</I>&gt;<i> contacted our parent company Eagle Wireless and both companies are very 
</I>&gt;<i> interested in forming a relationship and sponsorship with the JOS 
</I>&gt;<i> project.  This would dovetail nicely with a JOS.org if it existed.  I would 
</I>&gt;<i> like to discuss how this might work, people's opinions on such a 
</I>&gt;<i> relationship, etc.
</I>
I like these ideas, but I thing it's important to talk about how it
would/could happen.  Even though I would be happy to help pay money if it
was needed.

&gt;<i> 4.  Website - I'm about 75% done with a rewrite of the jos 
</I>&gt;<i> website.  Hopefully, I'll get a prototype setup so you can give me some 
</I>&gt;<i> feedback.  If not, at least get some ideas on what people see as being 
</I>&gt;<i> needed additions/changes from the current site design.
</I>
I'm looking forward to seeing it.
