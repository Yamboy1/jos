<PRE>Hi all

We are planning on having a IRC meeting this coming Sunday the 10th of
August 2000, at 17:00 UTC for about two hours.  This meeting will taking
place on the Undernet IRC Network, in the #jos channel.

This meeting is the first in a little over a year and I would like to
cover the following:
* The writing of a quarterly report, the last one was over two years ago.
* The creating of a non-profit entity to allow for fund raising, etc.
* The idea of sponsorship by outside organizations.
* The web-site update that Iain Shigeoka has been working on.
* Technical issues kernel, JVM, etc.
* What others are working on or would like to work on.

I hope to be online all day Sunday from about 14:00 UTC so please drop
by and say hello or have a chat before or after the meeting.  Also if
people would like to change the time i'll see what I can do.
