Great.  I hope you can show up for a bit on the chat just to let us know 
what the status is...  ;)

Hey, we haven't even set a date or time yet have we?  Thoughts?  Sometime 
sunday around midday central US timezone time would be great for me.... he 
he he.  Oops.   I guess we really should be setting this in UTC time 
huh?  For how many people will this be inconvenient?  I'm particularly 
thinking of people where this is late at night/early morning...  I recall 
the regular jos monthly meetings as being similar in time without causing 
too much trouble.
