Actually its strictly the wiki software and not the underlying RCS 
version control system that is causing the problem.  There is a 
patch to wiki that I haven't installed because I'm working on moving 
wiki over to a new version.  

It's a display problem (just exists on page render to user's browser) 
so I put it in the "annoying but not required to fix" list... :)  If you 
disagree and think it belongs in the "must fix immediately" list, let 
me know.
