Hi all,

It seems someone has done something wrong on the JOS Website. The
MemberList is gone

Who is the maintainer of that page?

A time ago i created a webapplication to be able to view Java-files
online.

You may have a look at http://jos.mediacom4.nl for the newest version.
Maybe it's usefull for other JOS-members. Let me know.

Where did I learn how to type?  I meant RCS.  It ended up just
being easier to edit the MemberList directly.  Let me know if
there are other problems.

Subject: [JOS] Communication between java application

Hi all,

Is there a way to have to applications communicate with eachother? I
know i can use RMI, CORBA or TCP/IP to establish a connection between
two applications, but isn't there a way to get a reference to a running
program so i can invoke methods from that running app?

This is the situation. I'm creating a Daemon app, This app runs in the
backjground without user interaction. Now i want to create a manager-app
to start and stop this daemon app. I've implemented two methods in that
daemon (startService() and stopService()). Now i want to have that
manager call one of those methods to start and stop the daemon. Is that
possible?

Or does JOS provide another environment where apps are running in?

Thanks.

Why not use one of those methods?  Is there any reason to avoid this
tried and true solutions?

Sounds like the perfect place to use RMI Activation as provided
for by rmid.  It's especially well suite to daemon processes as
you describe.  I personally would use Jini with Activation to
provide dynamic, loosely coupled, "federations" of services.

> Or does JOS provide another environment where apps are running in?

JOS is not ready for such use.  When it is, we plan on supporting
the entire standard java platform which includes rmi, tcpip, and
on top of it, activation and Jini.

Well, i don't completely understand RMI and or CORBA.... We've used
CORBA at school, and the first thing i did after those lessons was
burning those books. Damn, i hate CORBA.
I better start working on RMI instead :)

Yeah.  I dislike CORBA too.  Try rmi.  It takes a bit of learning
to get your mind around the concept of codebase and downloadable
code, but once you get it, its so easy to use you'll neve go back!

I've got a question about timezones.

I know what the GMT timezone is, but what is the UTC timezone?

Thanks for help

They are one and the same.  GMT is the old way to indicate standard
time (greenwich mean time) but the international standard dictates
its name to be UTC (universal time something).  In any case, they
indicate the same timezone.

ps - you may also see it referred to as 'zulu time' in USA military
jargon/standards/software.
