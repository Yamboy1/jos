Hi everybody

Well the subject of this email says it all, The JOS Project is two year's
old this month (anybody know the exact date?).  So what can we do to tell
the whe world this?

I myself haven't been active on the mailing lists or with development over
the last two months or so, due to work/laziness/etc, but I hope to change
this now that I have a linux box setup at home for development.

Subject: [JOS] JOS on Visor?

yo group,

take a look at this story:
http://www.palminfocenter.com/view_Story.asp?ID=179

the guy writes about the new Visor (www.handspring.com (I hope thats the 
correct URL, if not, try www.handsprings.com)

I guess most of you will have at least heard something about the Visor

for those who haven't: its like a Palm clone; its capable of running PalmOS 
and looks like a PalmPilot; it has one big advantage over the palm: the 
"springboard"; that allows you to extend the visor, using modules that look 
like the gameboy gamemodules; you simply plug them into the back of the 
visor; but those modules can be anything from extra memory over modems to 
digital cameras;

now: in this article, the writer claims that it might be possible to change 
the operating system of the visor by using such a module;
and not just as some weird hack, but to give users the freedom to use the 
OS of their choice;

wouldnt that be *coolest* Idea for JOS?

I mean, not just somehow porting the core system to the KVM and then 
running it ontop of the PalmPilot, as some kind of gimmick;
but as a real new OS for the Palm!! (pardon my screaming)

does anyone know if this article is nothing but Horse droppings or if 
there's some truth in it;

murphee

ps: i'm posting this here, since I wasn't sure if this would fit into the

I've heard the same thing about the plug-ins for the Visor (An article in a
Computer Currents mag), though it didn't mension anything about swappable
OSs.  I've heard of hot-swappable devices, but a hot-swappable OS?  I
*guess* it could work.

I think I remember reading that it's a 680x0;
but I looked at some developers-docs for the visor, and it says that
Visor uses the "Dragonball EZ" (I guess it's a Codename for some 680x0 CPU);

cool thing; if you're interested in porting JOS to Palm, you're
welcome!!
you might take a look at www.uclinux.org;
thats the website of the group that ports linux to the palm;
maybe we could "copy" something from there;

Subject: [JOS] Pre-JOS distribution of JOS code

Hello,

I was just wondering, what do the rest of you JOSers have to say about
<subject>?

I.e., if I've put an application (or any other piece) of code in the
org.jos.* hierarchy, and should feel like constructing a small web page for
the code in question, would that be acceptable? I mean, technically, the
code isn't "officially" part of JOS, since the JOS community has neither
accepted nor rejected the code.

It's just that when I write small stuff I feel I might aswell put it up on
my web page (why hide it?). But if it uses, or resides in, org.jos.* packages,
I'm not sure if, by common practice, I'm morally authorized to distribute
the code separately from JOS.

Subject: [JOS] The JOS Project's second birthday

I (me) need to spend some time catching up on our progress (part in kernel and
ui)
as part of my (heretofore honorary) role as PR guy.

What I would like to see is for us to work towards having something nifty to
show to
people, and it combination with that release do a big press flurry, web noise
kind of
thing... the date in mind is new years.

This gives us ~3 months to recover from the wiki problems, finish our work on
revitalizing
the site (like that faq I was beating on et al), and for the actual hackers to
try and come to
some sort of definable point..

Either we can glue a *nix lernel to a JVM with X (or Shark) and FB and cal it
the JOS Developers Kit v1.0 (or some such) (a similar bundle could be thrown
together with cygwin) .. or we could show them a working mukernel/vm.  Also
nifty would be to have some running UI code (even if it's hollow)..

As I said I have no idea where the hacking is at right now.  I do know that we
have been quiet the better part of this calendar year, and it would be great
press (and good for morale) to kick off next year with a bang..

Let me know what you all think?

Well, most of the code is C++.  Very little assembler.  And, in a past
life, I had to write some non-trivial amounts of 680x0 assembler, and,
let me tell you, it beats the hell out of writing x86 assembler (at
least the Motorola parts don't think it's 1972 when they reset).  So, I
should be able to help somewhat.

I do not know the details of the PalmOS API.  Perhaps it is possible to
have JOS simply be another "vanilla" Palm application.  That would
certainly be the path of least resistance -- were I you, I would
definitely start that way until events forced me off that path.

L0pht Heavy Industries has a PalmPilot development page at:
	http://www.L0pht.com/~kingpin/pilot.html

I know there are others (some are listed at the bottom of L0pht's
page).  If you find some really good ones, let me know. (Did I mention
I've got a Palm V and my wife has a Palm III?  I am a Big Fan of Palm
devices.)

I don't see why we shouldn't release JOS code before JOS is finished. If
this is truly an open source project, then this sort of thing would be
encouraged. To quote the Cathedral and the Bazaar:

It seems to work for me. Try removing your local copy of that file and
run "cvs update -d" again. If that doesn't work, try using "cvs
checkout" instead of "cvs update".

I will try to investigate the cause of this later but for now you can
try what I've said in this email.

(In future, please CC the admin@jos.org list for cvs problems -- thanks)

I would agree.  Since we don't have an "official" release of anything 
yet, I'd encourage individuals to create their own releases of code 
they have in working order.  Most of the JOS code is GPL or BSD 
licensed and you're both legally and morally in the clear to do this 
(as long as you follow the rules like distributing the source and 
including approprate copyright info).  Along the same vein, it would 
seem to me that you're welcome by the licenses that we use to 
make your own distribution if you want.

When we do finally ship something as an "official" release 
distribution of JOS, we'll want to probably clarify that either the 
code "belongs" to a particular JOS release, or specifically state 
that it is NOT part of a particular JOS release just to avoid 
confusion.  (I think Gilbert's excellent technical release is more of a 
developers preview release than a public release).  But certainly, 
you should try and get your code out into other hands to use and 
test as soon as you feel comfortable with it.  At least that's my 
opinion on it.
