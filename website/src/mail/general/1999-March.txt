Subject: [JOS] New Working Mail Lists...

Hello!

We have completed the migration of the working 
mailing lists from spin.de to jos.org  Web
access to these lists is at: 

	http://jos.org/mailman/listinfo

The jos-kernel and java-os-project list members
were automagically moved over to the new 
list server.  Anyway, here are the new lists:

List       | Purpose                 | Old List
-----------+-------------------------+----------
info       | Public Relations        |
admin      | Site Administration     |
vote-info  | Voting Membership List  |
 - - - - - + - - - - - - - - - - - - + - - - - - 
general    | Discussion List         | java-os-project
kernel     | Kernel Developers       | jos-kernel
arch       | Architectural Discourse | jos-network, jos-distributed, jos-security
apps       | Applications            | jos-apps
games      | Games!                  | jos-games
ui         | User Interface          | jos-ui
------------------------------------------------

The announce list will remain on spin.de into
the future (until mailman@list.org can handle a 
list with 4000+ members )

Best,

ClarkEvans

Clark,

Wasn't there supposed to be a 'biz' list too for licensing, constitutional,
etc discussions?  Or did I somehow miss that getting nixed?  If so, where do
those discussions take place now - general?

Yes.  Only the Kernel and General list were migrated.

Subject: [JOS] A quick note on un-subscribing

This mail server is a bit different than majordomo.

First of all, it currently requires a password 
for all list users.  I'm not too happy about this
personally, but when you were all migrated from
jos-kernel and java-os-project, you were automagically
assigned a password.

To un-subscribe in the new system:

1. Go to:

  http://www.jos.org/mailman/admin/general
    or 
  http://www.jos.org/mailman/admin/kernel

  depending upon which list you no longer are
  interested in.

2. Scroll down to where it says:

  "To change your subscription (set options like digest 
   and delivery modes, get a reminder of your password, 
   or unsubscribe from  General), enter your subscription 
   email address:"

3. Fill in your e-mail address and press "Edit Options"

4. Scroll down to where it says:

   "Click this button to have your password
    emailed to your list delivery address"

5. Press the button "Email My Password To Me"

6. Wait for the mail to come....

7. Press the BACK button (to get back to the /subscribe page )

8. Scroll to where it says:

   "To unsubscribe, enter your password and hit the button."

9. Type in your password in the text area, and press "Unsubscribe"


That's it.

Once a month you will all receive a message saying
what lists you are subscribed to and what the passwords
for those lists are.  This should help remind you that
you are indeed subscribed to a list... 

As of now, I don't know how to unsubscribe via e-mail,
so if you know how with mailman, let me know.  Furthermore,
I don't know if there is an equivalent to the 
"unsubscribe * username" which is horribly useful...

If you have any problems with the above, please
e-mail me _personally_ and I will make sure that
business is taken care of.

Best,

Clark Evans

Ok.  I'm dumb, put the wrong link. Very sorry.
This is a fixed version.
