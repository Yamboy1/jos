Subject: [JOS] Register to vote!

Hi all,

This is to announce that the vote-info@jos.org list is now available.

Why do you care?
	Well, if you are or plan to be an active participant in the JOS project 
and wish for your vote to count in important organizational issues, then 
you need to subscribe!  By subscribing to the vote-info list now you become 
registered to vote in the upcoming question on whether or not to accept the 
proposed JOS Constitution.  If the proposed Constitution is ratified, then 
the vote-info list will officially be the list of voting JOS members.  If 
you are not on this list, then your vote does not count.  This list is 
meant to be a very-low traffic list.  The ONLY posts which should be put 
onto this list are Calls For Votes and announcements of vote results.  All 
other discussion of upcoming votes should take place on other @jos.org 
lists as appropriate.  For instance, discussion about the Constitutional 
vote is taking place on the biz@jos.org list.

What does the proposed Constitution define?
	The only thing that the Constitution defines is a voting procedure by 
which we can make binding decisions as an organization.  We need this in 
order to do such things as decide on a license.  This voting procedure is 
the exact same one that we will use to ratify the Constitution.  To get 
more information on the proposed Constitution (and the procedure we will 
use to ratify it) see: http://jos.org/wiki/view/main/Constitution .  There 
are links there to the proposed Constitution, the accompanying PolicyBook, 
and a FAQ detailing the rationale behind the Constitution.

We will allow two months for members to register to vote by subscribing to 
the vote-info list before bringing the ratification of the proposed 
Constitution to a vote.

To subscribe to vote-info, please go to: 
http://jos.org/mailman/listinfo/vote-info

Also, the biz@jos.org list is now available.  This list is specifically for 
JOS organizational discussions such as constitutional & policy issues and 
our quarterly licensing discussions.  It is NOT for discussing coding 
issues of any kind, web site administration issues, or public relations 
issues.  There are other lists for those purposes.

To subscribe to biz, please go to: http://jos.org/mailman/listinfo/biz

Happy JOSing!

Hi everybody

Ok these are a little bit late, ok really late ;).

On the 28th of March, I was taking to ThierryMallard about why the 
project is taking such a long time to get going.  I also talked with 
adric about the current status of the project, and about Java2/Linux 
and vmware http://www.vmware.com/, I tried this and it looks good 
(also look out for http://www.freemware.org/).

On the 4th of April, I was taking ClarkEvans and MartinezG a little.  
I had a good talk with MattAlbrecht about drivers, ever body should 
read and comment on Matts device architecture document 
http://jos.org/wiki/view/main/DeviceArchitecture.  I was also talking 
to BlaSteD a long time lurker of the wiki web site, I asked him what 
was need to make the project better (it's basically what we are 
trying to do now).

I would like to find out how many people are looking just at the wiki 
web site (like BlaSteD).  So I would like somebody to setup a pole on 
the web site, something like the on the JavaLobby site 
(http://www.javalobby.org/), volunteers?

My logs of these meetings are available at

I'm new to the project and don't know much java.  However, I believe this project is intruiging and
was wondering if I could find some general info, including:

1)  how do I setup the system?
2)  How exactly does the system work?
3)  What kind of executable is used (simlpe bytecodes?)
4)  What filesystem is used?
5)  Is there any documentation for the project?
6)  Is the project site going to be reorganized?

Thank you for your info.

That's not likely.  I can test what you've got, but I won't be much good for actual coding.  I can't get

2.0.something and FreeDOS installed.  I can also probably get some buddies to install as well.

I would like to learn to code in JAVA.  The only problem is every book I find details the fine points of
coding net applets.  I know enough C to be able to handle the syntax of JAVA.  Any documentation 
on the system API?  Does anyone have any good books on prorgamming in the whole JAVA
language, not just what's used for a MSIE 4.0 or Navigator Gold setup.

Go to http://java.sun.com/docs/

I recommend reading "Java Tutorial" and "JDK 1.1 xxx documentation".
They can be browsed online or downloaded as a zip file.

The kernel/JVM is written in C/asm and ported to different chips, as much as possible would be in Java bytecode

Go to 
http://www.eckelobjects.com/javabook.html
and download the PDF-file. You find anything related to java in the book.
And use the official Sun documentation from

Hi everybody

I've made a small decision to stop doing the small weekly irc 
meetings in favor of larger monthly meetings.  These meetings we take 
place on the first Sunday of every month, at the same time and place 
as the current meeti ngs.  But we should add an extra hour to the 
time, just because one hour is to short.  This means that the next 
meeting will be on Sunday the 2nd May at 1700 GMT.  

As for this weeks meeting.  

It was mainly a conversation between ThierryMallard, Cayte and 
myself. Thierry has volunteered to help me with my kernel.  Then we 
all had a discussion about jos and open source project in general.

Subject: [JOS] New www.jos.org Web Page...

Hello all,

The proposed "new" www.jos.org front end (index.html web page) is now 
available for review at www.jos.org/test/.  As you can see its not that 
much different than the current one.  I've been working on database 
integration issues.  However, that's taking too long so I wanted to get 
something moving (so everyone thinks _something_ related to the www 
re-org is happening).

You may be wondering what is/are the benefit(s) of this web re-org.  
Right now this seems to be just a new border around the original web 
?front door? page with links to Wiki.  Well, the idea is to provide some 
structure to Wiki for new comers, members of the press, and those of 
us who don?t like to bookmark every section of the Wiki so we can find 
things.  The other is that we hope to add database functionality to make 
things like news and status reports easier to do than with Wiki.  What 
do you think?  Discussion should be carried out on the general jos 
mailing list (general@jos.org).  If there are no serious objections, I?ll be 
moving this into the main www.jos.org page April 22, 1999.

What do people think about me adding the navigation box at the left to 
the wiki templates so it appears in all wiki pages?

Yes it is a must. Being about to move to important section of a Web site
from any pages is very important for its success. 

Some comment about the front page. It looks a bit packed. Maybe adding more
white space between the top heading and the navigation bar and between the
navigation bar and  main text would improved the look. Otherwise, very nice
work!

Yeah, its a pretty good article.

It seems to me that we could well use the Java 2 API libraries straight
off.  This all depends on the license we decide on though.  It may be worth
trying out the Sun source code on the JVMs / Kernels we are building at
some point.  From reading the kernel mailing lists there certainly seems to
be some positive progress there.

Anyway, thats my 2p.

As I'm the creator of this Wiki and know it rather well therefore, I
think
that maybe doing this with frames is the better idea. Otherwise the
navigation
box maybe interferes with the Wiki content and I do not want that
somebody
accidently damages the navigation bar with his Wiki page.

OK.  I've actually been working on it using php and postgresql but if you 
can think of a nice way to integrate it directly into Wiki that would be 
cool too.  To avoid redundant work, we should coordinate efforts.  
Speaking of Wiki:

1. I've noticed the Wiki pages are set up for revisions of pages but its 
not actually being done.  Any plans on getting this implemented? Or is 
it and I'm just not seeing it?

2. Helmut has noticed that the Wiki is a processor hog.  I've noticed 
that there are typically < 10 changes a day to the wiki.  Perhaps 
instead of doing the processing everytime a page is displayed (which 
presumably happens often) we do the normal "view" processing for a 
page everytime a page is changed (and unfortunately update all the 
pages everytime any page is added/deleted (can a page be deleted 
through the wiki?) which presumably happens even less often).  So Wiki 
basically only runs when a change or add/delete are done.  It generates 
static pages that are used whenever a wiki page is viewed.  The 
algorithm you'd have to develop to scan/update all pages when a new 
wiki page is created (to update links) could also be used to auto-
generate a comprehensive wiki index which is sorely needed.  Also a 
Wiki search?

3. The wiki seems inherently hard to organize because its basically a 
one layer deep, extremely bushy tree.  We basically have 6 braches:
[JOS] [KAFFE] [KORE] [JAS] [RTEMS] [PSI] 
with jos having the vast lion's share of pages 

Branch: Page Count
==============
JOS           1249
KAFFE       7
KORE        3
RTEMS      3
PSI            3
JAS           8

Can you think of anyway for us to define "parent" page(s) for each page 
so that they will show up in a heirarchy?  I suppose wiki could simply 
move each file to a subdirectory when moved in the wiki system.  And 
then at the top of each wiki page could be a "navigation line" similar to 
the one they use on big sites like Yahoo.com (i.e.  
"Location:  JOS -> WorkingGroups -> KernelGroup -> MicroKernel"
with each step in the list being a link to the appropriate page).

4.  Do you (Markus) have time to hack Wiki or should I help?  Since you 
wrote wiki you can probably make these changes really fast but if you 
don't have time I can help.

Not if its static (which I think is a "good idea").  It should only point to 
major "stable" sections of the wiki to be useful so I don't see a problem 
with putting it into the template.  Check out:

http://jos.org/wiki/view/test/main

Where I've hacked a pre-existing template to include a navigation bar.  If 
we use SSI instead of hard coding it in like I've done there, we can 
simply edit one "master" navigation bar code fragment and it will show 
up in all wiki templates... and hence all wiki pages.  I was thinking of 
doing it for the "static" front end web pages anyhow.

(for test purposes only, that section of the wiki will be up and down and 
deleted so don't put things you want to keep there).

Subject: [JOS] O'Reilly editorial on Java OS's

Greetings all,

Well I read the article, it was pretty light and fluffy and overlooked many facets of OS responsibilities and capabilities but what could you really expect from a single page of text. 

A small snippet of the text tells us:

"Once the OS is irrelevant, you might as well remove it entirely
  as a distinct entity. Instead, why not fold the OS and the Java
  environment together? Right now, the Java environment runs
  as a process inside some OS. An OS with a built-in JVM can
  make much more efficient use of memory and processing
   power to run Java applications."

To me the OS will never be irrelevant. JOS (as I understand it, please correct me if i'm wrong) will still have to provide system resources coherently and securely for the Java Applications that it will execute.

The way I currently see JOS is as a small platform dependant microkernel which maps the physical system resources available into the platform independant JOS kernel which in turn provides all the necessary OS services (reliability,restartability,security,filesystems etc etc) to the many independant Java applications that execute.

Am I off the track?  Comments?

Cheers
Geoff O'Callaghan

Check out OpenPortal; it is like a Wiki but has nestable categories so
that pages can contain pages.  So for example in Wiki a Wikiname might be
MostRecentChanges, but in OpenPortal you could have a Wiki name such as
/JOS/Projects/Kernel/Most Recent Changes (names can have spaces in
OpenPortal).  Link services will automatically hyperlink to this page.  In
OpenPortal pages can also return output, so that one page can 'call'
another page as if it were a function and it could return output.  See
www.openportal.org for the user interface templates.  OpenPortal will be
released in June under the GPL, and is in 100% Pure Java using servlets.

Hmmm. I'm not sure about this, but doesn't the RFC that defines the URL
explicitly forbid spaces in URLs? If so, one would have to remember to not
use that feature of OpenPortal to maintain maximum compatibility.

The space simply must be converted to %20 - actually all characters can
be present in URLs as long as they are encoded that way. JOS handles
spaces, too,
by the way (it was actually the first wiki to do so ) - but you have to
explicitely create the link with a special command - and that way you
lose
much of what wiki is about.

Looks great!  I had wondered what you disappeared to do.  :)  So, 
should we simply wait until OpenPortal is ready to go (and just hack the 
current Wiki to hold us over)?  :)

Seriously, I have some concerns regarding it:

It appears to have all the new features we've been discussing.  However, 
does it have all the old features?  For instance, in Wiki you simply write 
a WikiName and its automatically linked (or a link to a potential new 
page is generated).

Does it have facilities for easily creating FAQ's and project  
news/updates/status reports?  Or are those planned?  This was one of 
the "new" things I had wanted to add to JOS's web site.

Does it support versioning of pages (or is this planned)?

I know you're still building the first prototype so things are a bit shakey 
and you probably have a long wish list too.  Just wanted to get as much 
info as possible.  I'd hate to do a lot of work on the current JOS web site 
now only to have the effort become redundant in two months.  :)

I second the motion.  All in favor?  Unless there are serious objections 
I'll do this on Thursday, April 22 when I migrate the new jos front page in.

Agreed.  If I roll all the other wiki's into the main jos wiki, the bottom 
horz nav bar will go away.  (maybe to be replaced by links to major 
working group pages but initially just removed).

Agreed.  Plus, I'd like to auto generate the "glossary" and call it an 
"index".  The glossary should be an annotated index (but if the index is 
autogenerated we'd need to come up with a specialized method of 
annotating it so that the annotations "stick" between re-gen).

Yes.  The first crude prototype is available for review at 

http://www.jos.org/test/

It obviously needs more content but its available now to see if the 
structure is what we're looking for.

When converted to URLs the spaces are turned into + (pluses), which is
appropriate to the RFC spec.  So the above url would be
/JOS/Projects/Kernel/Most+Recent+Changes

Yes.  OpenPortal has extensive automagic linking services, which is what I
call the Wiki names in Wiki.  OpenPortal has something called Easy Command
Language (ECL), which let's you do some cool stuff.  The simplest example
would be ["Main Page"], where the brackets indicate to the system that
this is an ECL phrase.  This would be typed into a textarea box while
editing a page.  The quotes say that this is the name of a page (this
replaces the Wiki name idea.  So the system would automatically turn the
phrase ["Main Page"] into a hyperlink that links to the page with the name
"Main Page".

Here's another example of ECL.  To make your own menu along the side of a
page in OpenPortal, you would enter the following in the html through an
edit box or in a template file:

Menu
----
[Edit this Page]
[Delete this Page]
[Clone this Page]
[Send Email to Author of this Page]

OpenPortal's automagic system would automatically turn these into the
correct hyperlinks to tell the openportal system to initiate these
commands when clicked on by the user.

Another cool ECL command is to put your email address between brackets at
the bottom of an OpenPortal page, such as [bkn3@columbia.edu].  What this
does is that every time the page is edited the OpenPortal system scans
the page and sends email to anyone who has their email address in brackets
on the system.  [bkn3@columbia.edu] is shorthand Easy Command Language for
[on change bkn3@columbia.edu].

One more cool ECL phrase is that you can use ownership terms instead of
exact web page names.  So I could type the following into an edit form:

Make sure to check out [My Home Page]

and the system will convert it into the special form using whoever was
the user who entered the MY part into the edit form:

Make sure to check out [My {Brad Neuberg} Home Page]

The sentence would print out on the screen as

Make sure to check out _My Home Page_

where the underscores are a hyperlink.  Anything between the {}s are not
printed out.

Yes.  OpenPortal supports something called weblets, which are sorta like
server-side javabeans.  An example weblet would be a business card.  A
weblet is a data-object that has data for certain properties, so for the
business card this would be a Name, Organization, Phonenumber, etc.  A
weblet also provides facilities to edit and change this data-object
through a web interface, so that the weblet would provide an html form to
change this data object.  One can add a new weblet to a page by using Easy
Command Language.  To add a business card to a page I could type the
following in the edit box:

Make sure to check out my [BusinessCard].

When I saved the page the page would reload with a blank business card
embedded as html into the openportal page, with a tiny edit button next to
it.  When I hit the edit button I would get a form with fields for the
name, organization, phone number, etc.  One can have as many weblets on a
page as they want:

Everyone, please check out the [Schedule].  Also make sure to append your
contact cards here:

  [Brad Neuberg's Contact Card]
  [Ward Cunningham's Contact Card]
  [Markus Peter's Contact Card]

Please read the FAQ below:

[FAQ]

Since weblets can be any sort of structured data, a FAQ Weblet could also
be created.  Weblets are really just JavaBeans with a web interface to
display and edit them.

> Does it support versioning of pages (or is this planned)?

Not right now.  Eventually CVS integration is planned (this would be
OpenPortal 3).  OpenPortal 2 is what is being released at the end of June.

Subject: [JOS] Command Line idea

Greetings.

I had an idea as to how to implement commands in the command line
interface of JOS. Why not have a centric registry with all the available
commands, and then use this registry to map the command function to a
specific class that implements org.jos.command.Command or something?

Example:

CD=org.jos.command.commands.CD
MKDIR=org.jos.command.commands.MKDIR

etc.?

The command interface could be:

public void processCommand(CommandLineSession session, String command,
String[] parameters);

and CommandLineSession can give access to the IN and OUT of the session
(screen, port, server, etc.) and other things, like current directory,
command history list, etc.

This way, users can implement their own commands, possibly download
remote registries of commands on the fly, or write their own commands
without the need to reimplement the entire command line sub system of
JOS. Even native commands can then be added by distributors, for
example, a server machine may want to have commands for direct access to
the fan and cooling system, or the UPS; the admin won't have to open a
special program to send the commands.

What do you think?

I like the idea of command mapping but, wanting JOS to be more accesible, I dont like the idea of making it be JOS specific. Personally Im with the pro-true-multiple-process-environment people so I
assume the System and stuff like that would be given its own process, and while that would make its own mess of problems solving them makes JOS more usable and more WORA then the JOS-specific
stick-to-the-way-sun-did-it-for-the-JVM.

Just my two cents

Sounds like a very good idea. 

One thing though that I haven't seen mentioned before with respect to the
standard commands.

What do you guys think of "the bash way of doing things"? That is, the command
line is just an easy way to execute scripts line by line. I think JOS should
adopt that strategy.

I just wanted to mention that, because if you guys agree, then one might have
to take a somewhat different approach when designing/implementing the
specifics. I just think it's *so* great, the way things are done in bash.

For those of you who aren't familir with Unix, bash is the (or at least one of
the) defacto standard shells. It, along with other shells, is basically an
applications that executes shell scripts. The "command line" is then just a
special case of shell script execution. So you can execute loops, if/else
statements and things like that on the command line, just as if it was part of
a script on file.

PS.
        How about even making the JOS shell compatible with bash, only
implemented in a different way? I know some things might be inheretedly (sp?)
hard to "fit" into JOS, in which case it can be skipped, but I think the syntax
of bash scripts make sense. Unless we want an object oriented shell that is.
And making it (largely) compatible, would 1) attract Unix people, and 2) make
some script-based applications/utilities easier to port.

Hmmm.

Of course, I give you that; but A) the CLI is part of the UI (JADE) and not part of JOS and B) one of the goals of JOS, in my opinion at least, is to minimize the system specfic junk to things that
would be truly impossoble to do any other way (and those designed so you dont need to rewrite the whole thing to change every little thing)

It may be a little harder for us to do it that way, but its better it be hard to make then hard to use I always say (well thats the first time I said that, but hey)

Ok I think we had the "lets not make it UNIX, we want other people to be able to use it too" argument, but if you want to get on the UI mailng list we could always design a BASH PUI (plug UI) after we
get JADE designed and beat.

In what why does *supporting* bash commands make it harder to use? Is it more
difficult to type "cd <directory>" in Unix than in DOS? 

I don't think I'm the only one who wants to see a *powerful* CLI (the DOS
command line does not qualify). But just because the features are there, it
doesn't mean you have to use them. I've followed the discussion on the UI
mailinglist, but from them I certainly haven't got the impression that a
non-powerful leight-weight not-really-usable CLI is what people want.

We *do* want to support scripts, right? Then why limit the command line by not
allowing the same syntax there as in script files? One can easily add dir, del,
ren etc commands to that shell if that's easier to use (not my opinion).

I really like this idea.  In fact, I've been thinking about this sort of
'scripting' for some time.

One thing I would like however, is to be able to pass not only String
objects on the command line, but any kind of Object.

Let's give an example,

> The command interface could be:
> 
> public void processCommand(CommandLineSession session, String command,
> String[] parameters);
> 

I propose something like:

public void commandMethod(CommandLineSession session, String command,
                          Object[] parameters);

If I suppose that words starting with a dollar sign ($) are variables, I
could now do things like:

$files = DIR
$sorted = SORT $files

With the DIR and SORT commands being defined somewhat the way you
said:

DIR=org.freeware.Filesystem.dirCommand
SORT=org.openproject.TextUtil.quickSortCommand

The only difference is that I go even further as to specify the method
name (we can do that pretty easily with the introspection API).  The
method signature for all "commandMethods" would be the same.

What we're really getting into is some sort of intepreted 'shell
programming language'...

Let's make another, more interesting example:

$receivedFaxes = com.faxcompany.FaxQueue.received()
$fax = Enumeration($receivedFaxes) {
  com.imagecompany.PrintUtils.printfax($fax)
  com.faxcompany.FaxQueue.delete($fax)
}

I don't necessarily propose this syntax/semantic, I just want to highlight
that we could deal with any kind of objects within the script.  All this
without having to deal with temporary files and all the problems they
bring. (We could also get polymorphism directly from the command line!)

Regards,
Alex Boisvert

Yes, sure, but an OS has certain OS-specific things, such as a registry,
a control panel, a GUI loader, etc. I am just proposing that software
developers can add functionality to a JOS system (workstation or server)
by not having to re-implement entire subsystems, rather, that JOS by
default be extensible in the command line aspect too.

I see what you mean... This would mean that there must be a storage for
such variables. What if this could be integrated with the JOS registry
(the version of the JOS registry I created supports Objects as well as
Blobs and the rest)? What if the command line is really a singe line
script, such as JavaScript, that runs on an engine that provides access
to the entire JOS system? Security would not be a concern, since the
script can be treated as "on the fly" byte code.


People?

I never said we couldnt support bash, I even mentioned that JADE could easily have a bash CLI; and where did DOS come from?

The UI group is trying to make JADE, thats not a UI but a socket to plug any UI into. from a bash-ish CLI to a X-window-ish GUI to a whatever else. and frankly, most people dont want a CLI (Im talking
non-programmers here, I want one m'self)

Yes, we do want scripts. Yes, we do want a powerful CLI. We dont want *one* though. I reccomend you look at the JADE page via Wiki.

(also: Im trying to get everyone to stick to the defs on UserInterfaceDefinitions, we've had alot of confusion over stuff like that)

Not generally enough, IMHO. Use RMI or similar and bind a new command to
an RMI URL. Let the command plugin modules decide for themselves what
kind of parameters (with implicit verification by the RMI object serializer)
they want to see, and how they want to get called.

Hello all.

Just thought I'd give a bit of input on the new style wiki pages.  I think
they look really good.  Easy to read and pretty easy to navigate around.  I
can't remember who is responsible for them (hence mailing here) but well
done.

Any thoughts on producing a frame based version at some point?  I know this
produces a few issues.  Actually, if you need any help on the page
re-design / update then let me know.

Anyway - good stuff,

Tim.

- From the darkest corners of my mind... There seems to have been a
misunderstanding on my part. When you commented about the lack of ease of use, I
thought you were refereing to bash in the context of CLI:s. Judging by your
response, you meant just generally that a CLI is hard to use.

I'm certainly not saying that JOS should be CLI based, but rather, as I
believe has been discussed, both a GUI and CLI based system - that is, you can
choose whichever one you like and use it to configure the system without
limitations. And this pluggability would be part of what JADE is all about. 

As a result, there is bound to be a default CLI (even if the CLI is fully
pluggable). And making that one, or one of the, in case of multiple default
CLIs (selected upon installation for example), bash:ish is what I propose.

ditto; personally, though, I want the four virtual desktops of X with the first being a CLI that you launch the programs with but hopefully that will be easy to do with JADE

Hmm, well if we do it right theoretically one wouldnt need a CLI period (for those used to iMacs and other electronics in custom colors ;). Again, personally, I think the best thing we can do is
create all the little components so that people can build whatever they want to (just had a flashback to using legos) and a net.installer for the first time user that lets you select the configuration
then just download the required stuff (obviosly this would be a low priority, but one nessecary for mass appeal).

I hope that made sense to everyone, because I dont think it made sense to me (up for two days, praise caffine, you see)

>blah blah

What seems to be  missing from this discussion is how you are going to 
plug different CLI's into the System. 

The shell does quite a lot of low-level work, for example bash expands 
arguments with wildcards for the local filesystem (*.wav becomes 1.wav 
2.wav 3.wav etc), it also controls where input and output are attached 
to (you can redirect input and output with >,<). Then it also adds its 
scripting language.

There needs to be an interface for shells to access the OS services, 
preferably one that allows multiple shells to be developed easily. It 
might even be possible to have a visual scripting environment (with a 
visual language). 

As far as the need for a scripting language goes, it will be extremely 
beneficial to include a bash-compatible shell, as this is a defacto 
standard. It will probably also be useful in other areas (eg Linux uses 
scripts to control what happens during startup).

My 3cents worth

Definitley, I think we should define a language independent scripting interface so we could implememtn different script langs (although ECMA should be standard, agreed) without having to recode all
the system hooks and such. This would make it easier to script system stuff (and for scriptlangs already written you'd just need to code a few proxy classes)

I propose that we include JavaScript as a standard scripting language in
JOS, for a few reasons. First of all, because we decided to do that a
few months ago. Second, JavaScript can be implemented freely, right?
Then, JavaScript looks a lot like Java, and can access the JVM and
System very easily. And many, many more people know JavaScript than any
other scripting language, or at least are more familiar, since they are
using it in their home pages.

No plans at the present.  There seemed to be quite a few people that 
were violently opposed to frames so I had pretty much removed it from 
consideration in the redesign.  Do you consider it a "must have" feature?

If you have time, I'd really appreciate help reorganizing the Wiki.  The 
project signup page is not organized well.  If you could try and 
reorganize it that would help.  Actually we need a separate wiki page 
that is a nice list of active JOS projects (as a compliment to the working 
groups listing) with a link to each project's wiki page, and perhaps a 
short description.  Right now, its pretty difficult to figure out exactly 
what are the active jos projects...  You know, where actual code is 
being created to create concrete programs (as opposed to the working 
groups where ideas are being discussed and coding is optional).

The main wiki page could use some reorganization, and the jos irc 
meeting announcement should probably be moved to a separate 
JosAnnounce wiki page with only a one liner announcement and a link 
to the times on the main wiki page.  *whew*  

I have been looking over the original wiki site (the site where we got the 
first copy of the wiki) and the way they keep things organized is they 
have several self-appointed wiki organizers that just go around and clean 
up pages, create "meta-pages" that basically summarize groups of 
pages and provide links to them, and organize the links between pages 
to make sense.  We (jos wiki) only seem to have people that create the 
"leaf" pages of the wiki.  We're missing the self-appointed organizers 
that help to organize, summarize and arrange the wiki pages.   So if you 
could, whenever you have the time, just start organizing when you see a 
need, it would help a ton.  I think many members are reluctant to edit 
other people's pages or create summaries which basically leaves a ton 
of pages "stranded" with only a few links to them buried deep inside the 
bodies of other pages...

Sorry for the rant.  Just trying to be a cheerleader for some self-
appointed wiki organizers to emerge and start aggressively organizing 
the wiki.  :)

Hi all!

I know we've been discussing using BeanShell many times before, but I felt like
argumenting for it now.
I peeped Pat's site (http://www.ooi.com/beanshell/) today, and dl:ed the latest
version (0.96 beta). It's so great. I can't understand why it's still pretty
unknown. Maybe it isn't. =P

It's GPL'ed now.
You can call any java class from inside of it, you can run it in interpreter
mode, console mode and server mode. The server mode is waay cool. You just
specify a port, and it launches a tiny httpd. When you connect to it with a

There is a freeware ECMAscript implemented in Java. Maybe the
developer would be interested in sharing the code.

Hi everybody

This is just a notice to say that there will be an IRC meetings this 
Sunday the 2nd May 1999, at 17:00 GMT for two hours (i will be there 
for longer).  This meeting will taking place on the Undernet IRC 
Network, to find a local server have a look at this page 
<URL:http://www.mn.us.undernet.org/servers.html>.

The agenda for this meeting will be as follows (although it's not set 
in stone or anything):

* the new web site; what needs to be done, who should do it, when and 
how should any changes be made
* organizational structure; constitution, etc
* development; kernel, jvm, etc

I haven't discussed this agenda with anybody, so if there are any 
problems with any of it bring it up on the mailing list or at the 
meeting.

I'm also aware that it is a bank holiday weekend in some part of the 
world.  So if you are thinking of joining in the discussion, can you 
send me an email just so I can know the approximate numbers who will 
be attending.

I have already contacted the author, and am testing the app. I assume
you are talking about BeanShell, ne?
