Thanks for the heads up.  Although I'm not a PR person, I've tried 
to post a reasonable followup.

JOS Silently Flourishing... 510000000000600
Posted by Iain Shigeoka, 11 Nov


 Hello,

  First, I'd like to insert a quick disclaimer that I'm speaking for 
myself, and not as a JOS &quot;official&quot;.

From my viewpoint, the JOS Project is silently flourishing. The 
current JOS status can be summarized as follows:

1) A native kernel and JVM is in the late phases of initial 
implementation. It's booting, painting the screen, grabbing
keyboard input, running tests, etc. There are still some very rough 
spots that need to be ironed out and some minor holes in the 
implementation that remain. But its getting very close.

2) The core group is now turning its eye towards porting classpath 
(www.classpath.org) as the new, highest priority task for the 
project. This will create a full Java Platform (as per Sun's definition) 
sans GUI on JOS. Finishing the remaining tasks in 1) and 
completing 2) will provide a full OS and java libraries. Most pure 
java apps should then run on JOS without modification.

As for explaining the lack of news concerning the project, the JOS 
project is IMHO experiencing two simultaneous phenomenon. First, 
we are in the implementation phase of writing a kernel. Second, our 
website has gone through a couple of meltdowns recently and we 
have moved our mailing lists from one server to another.

It would seem natural to me for a project of this type to go through 
at least one large swing in visible activity during kernel 
implementation. In the beggining, JOS was an idea and so heavy 
discussion and brainstorming was the order of the day. A lot of 
documentation was created. This creates a lot of visible activity. 
The core contributors were spending their time developing these 
documents.

Now that we've moved into initial implementation, we're not 
brainstorming as much. The core developers are writing code and 
not producing web documents. So the visible activity has gone way 
down. In addition, other projects (such as the user interface group) 
is basically in a holding pattern waiting for an initial kernel release.

The particulars of kernel code development means that, for quite a 
large portion of code development, there's no real distributable beta 
code that people can try out. So visible progress appears to be 
&quot;stalled&quot;. IMHO, I think this illusion of the project being stalled out, 
will continue until we get the kernel and a base java library 
(classpath) working. Once we can release a beta os and libraries, I 
think you will see a sudden flurry of JOS related activity. We very 
tentatively are targeting a spring beta release.

I should also add that development is going slower than many other 
open source projects because (as far as I'm aware) all the core 
developers are employed or in school full-time. So we don't have a 
group of &quot;super developers&quot; that can contribute 40+ hours a week 
to the project. JOS develompent ramains slow and steady.

The website problems that JOS has suffered recently are due to 
many factors. The end result has been that our collaborative 
document web (the Wiki) has been moved to a temporary server 
(with some links breaking during the move), while the main web 
page, and CVS server remains at the original web server 
(www.jos.org). In addition, early this year, we relocated our mailing 
lists to our main web server which has possibly &quot;stranded&quot; some 
older subscribers. Amid this chaos, its been hard to keep the 
website running, let alone add content.

In fact, as the JOS webmaster, I've been spending all my JOS time 
working on the next generation of the JOS website instead of 
cleaning up the site and adding content. I hope that this effort will 
pay off in increased usability and functionality of the site in the near 
future. Both of which will probably needed when the next rush of 
activity occurs at JOS (hopefully during a spring beta release!). For 
the short term though, its meant reduced information and a hobbled
site.

The JOS project is always looking for volunteers! I highly suggest 
browsing the Wiki, and joining the mailing lists if you're interested. 
There's a decent amount of traffic on the mailing lists, and the wiki 
holds a wealth of information. If you want to help out on the 
website, register for a WikiName, put on a hard hat and help us to 
clean up our Wiki!

Other questions about the JOS project should be sent to the 
general mailing list (<A HREF="mailto:general@jos.org">general@jos.org</A>). Alternatively, you can send 
me a note and I'll try and answer it or pass it on to the appropriate 
person(s).
