<PRE>Hi, all!

I have read JOS mailing lists archives. On UI group there were a thread
some time ago about this. Although I think that making different JDK
releases fully compatible (even if only backward compatible) would be a
very useful thing but I doubt this will happen soon. The bad thing is
that JDK is so monolithic piece of software. It would be much better
IMHO if instead of one JDK we would have separate libraries - eg.
Utility library, AWT library etc. It's just an example and I'm not sure
but security issues of JDK1.2 rather don't affect AWT ;-), am I right?
So why release it in one piece? If it won't happen the whole system
would be more flexible. But these are just my wishes :-(. Even libraries
for languages that are on market for much longer than Java, for example
C++ are undergoing changes, sometimes breaking any compatibility
(libc&lt;-&gt;glibc change in GNU libraries, recent change in C++ specs which
causes many problems with compilers).

These are my thoughts about possible solutions to problem with
incompatible JDK releases:

1. Static linking.
Let's take a look at C++ applications (I'm talking about such basic
things to make me clear). They can be dynamically or statically linked.
Dynamically means that they use some external libraries, in fact a
specific version of these libraries. They are smaller than statically
linked versions but suffer from possible incompatibility problems.
Statically linked applications does not use external libraries - they
have all of them compiled into executable file.
In Java, all applications are 'dynamically linked'. Possible solution is
to package classes it uses with program. But this is not possible for
native classes and doesn't solve VM incompatibility problems.

2. JDK for JOS (much better solution)
Some people think that JOS should mimic JDK. I think it should not (at
least not its core). I think that JOS core should provide VM to run
bytecode and its own hardwired system classes (jos.org.* and below?) -
that's all. This way it would be possible to run applications compiled
for different JDKs (even ancient ones) without any problems. Which JDK
to run under could be choosen from some property panel or detected at
runtime(?).

Incompatibility problem can be breaked into two smaller problems:
- VM incompatibility.
As VM functionality is provided by system, system should have
possibility to run applications in different VM versions. It would not
be a problem since VM changes should be very rare (I hope :-)
- Core classes incompatibility.
As JDKs are mostly backward compatible, providing older class library
would require substituting incompatible classes only. Say, application
was compiled for JDK 1.1 and current standard JOS classpath is 1.2. So
an imaginary classpath would look like:
./application.jar:/classpath/ver1.1.jar:/classpath/ver1.2.jar
As JOS is a _Java_ OS I think that native classes problem would go away,
too, as they could be implemented as JOS system calls in Java.
Easy enough, I think. And very flexible. If user doesn't want to run any
older applications, he does not install compatibility libraries. But he
may do so at any time.

These are just my thoughts, so let people criticise (or express awe ;-)

Bye,
Max
