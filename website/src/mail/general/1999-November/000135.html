Subject: [JOS] JDK incompatibility solutions
[...]
&gt;<i> 2. JDK for JOS (much better solution)
</I>&gt;<i> Some people think that JOS should mimic JDK. I think it should not (at
</I>&gt;<i> least not its core). I think that JOS core should provide VM to run
</I>&gt;<i> bytecode and its own hardwired system classes (jos.org.* and below?) -
</I>&gt;<i> that's all. This way it would be possible to run applications compiled
</I>&gt;<i> for different JDKs (even ancient ones) without any problems. Which JDK
</I>&gt;<i> to run under could be choosen from some property panel or detected at
</I>&gt;<i> runtime(?).
</I>

I afrad I don't agree here... I think the JOS should be as close to the
standard implementation as possible...
It just means that *anything* would run on it, including 1.1 &amp; 1.2 code.

This also makes it much simpler for the guys writing the kernel... in this
case, all they have to do is provide the basic windowing systems, and hook
the AWT components into their peers. With a model like this, we then have
the OS... and anyone can implement an environment that works for them...
needless to say, JOS would come with one or two default environments, but
would wouldn't need to use them.
This also means that the kernel guys can focus on making the native side as
fast and stable as posible, and not have to worry about the L&amp;F of the rest
of the thing.

All it has to do, is boot to a basic graphical environment... once done, the
rest of the system can take any form it wishes.

&gt;<i> Incompatibility problem can be breaked into two smaller problems:
</I>[...]
&gt;<i> Easy enough, I think. And very flexible. If user doesn't want to run any
</I>&gt;<i> older applications, he does not install compatibility libraries. But he
</I>&gt;<i> may do so at any time.
</I>
So why not allow the choice to the application. Let each application choose
a namespace (sandbox?), and allow the system to be configured, so that an
application can be set to run in a 1.1 VM, or a 1.2 VM... in that case, it
will require a little creativity on the part of the kernel people... but its
doable i think.
Obviously it would be best is the OS and its applications ran in the same
VM... that would make maximum usage of memory, and runtime performance...
however, I can see instance where running in separate VMs would be
beneficial... i.e. for stability (separation of process)...
Anyway, this is fancy stuff... that can be dreamed up later... you would
need a special VM Factory that could create the different VMs, but still
allow the applications to access one another (as in the instance of
Singleton classes, such as a file system, or security manager).

Personally, all I want right now, is a working kernel, with the JVM
implemented... once I get my hands on that, we can start on the rest of the
system.
