<PRE>Hi everybody

This is just a notice to say that there will be an IRC meetings this 
Sunday the 2nd May 1999, at 17:00 GMT for two hours (i will be there 
for longer).  This meeting will taking place on the Undernet IRC 
Network, to find a local server have a look at this page 
&lt;URL:<A HREF="http://www.mn.us.undernet.org/servers.html">http://www.mn.us.undernet.org/servers.html</A>&gt;.

The agenda for this meeting will be as follows (although it's not set 
in stone or anything):

* the new web site; what needs to be done, who should do it, when and 
how should any changes be made
* organizational structure; constitution, etc
* development; kernel, jvm, etc

I haven't discussed this agenda with anybody, so if there are any 
problems with any of it bring it up on the mailing list or at the 
meeting.

I'm also aware that it is a bank holiday weekend in some part of the 
world.  So if you are thinking of joining in the discussion, can you 
send me an email just so I can know the approximate numbers who will 
be attending.
