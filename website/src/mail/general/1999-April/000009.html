Original Text from &quot;Iain Shigeoka&quot;

&gt;&gt;<i> 1)  how do I setup the system?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It's in a &quot;pre-beta&quot; stage right now.  You can join the kernel development 
</I>&gt;<i>team and help.
</I>That's not likely.  I can test what you've got, but I won't be much good for actual coding.  I can't get
my text-based computer game in C to compile.  But I have a Micro$oftless machine with Linux 
2.0.something and FreeDOS installed.  I can also probably get some buddies to install as well.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2)  How exactly does the system work?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Its still being built!  If you'd like to help, you can help to determine that 
</I>&gt;<i>exact question.
</I>What I meant was:  Are you planning on making this system plain Command line, a GUI, or a 
DOSSHELL like in-between command system?  Any plans on making a bash-like command shell
with linux-like features.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3)  What kind of executable is used (simlpe bytecodes?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Native micro kernel (machine dependent assembly), with java 
</I>&gt;<i>(bytecodes) for everything else.
</I>What do you mean by this?

&gt;&gt;<i> 6)  Is the project site going to be reorganized?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'm working on it.  If you'd like to help I could use some!  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I don't have any skill with wiki-web, but I've got some HTML I could help you with.

I would like to learn to code in JAVA.  The only problem is every book I find details the fine points of
coding net applets.  I know enough C to be able to handle the syntax of JAVA.  Any documentation 
on the system API?  Does anyone have any good books on prorgamming in the whole JAVA
language, not just what's used for a MSIE 4.0 or Navigator Gold setup.
