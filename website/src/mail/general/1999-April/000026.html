It will be available in June under the GPL in 100% Pure Java.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It appears to have all the new features we've been discussing.  However, 
</I>&gt;<i> does it have all the old features?  For instance, in Wiki you simply write

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yes.  OpenPortal has extensive automagic linking services, which is what I
call the Wiki names in Wiki.  OpenPortal has something called Easy Command
Language (ECL), which let's you do some cool stuff.  The simplest example
would be [&quot;Main Page&quot;], where the brackets indicate to the system that
this is an ECL phrase.  This would be typed into a textarea box while
editing a page.  The quotes say that this is the name of a page (this
replaces the Wiki name idea.  So the system would automatically turn the
phrase [&quot;Main Page&quot;] into a hyperlink that links to the page with the name
&quot;Main Page&quot;.

Here's another example of ECL.  To make your own menu along the side of a
page in OpenPortal, you would enter the following in the html through an
edit box or in a template file:

Menu
----
[Edit this Page]
[Delete this Page]
[Clone this Page]
[Send Email to Author of this Page]

OpenPortal's automagic system would automatically turn these into the
correct hyperlinks to tell the openportal system to initiate these
commands when clicked on by the user.

Another cool ECL command is to put your email address between brackets at
the bottom of an OpenPortal page, such as [<A HREF="mailto:bkn3@columbia.edu">bkn3@columbia.edu</A>].  What this
does is that every time the page is edited the OpenPortal system scans
the page and sends email to anyone who has their email address in brackets
on the system.  [<A HREF="mailto:bkn3@columbia.edu">bkn3@columbia.edu</A>] is shorthand Easy Command Language for
[on change <A HREF="mailto:bkn3@columbia.edu">bkn3@columbia.edu</A>].

One more cool ECL phrase is that you can use ownership terms instead of
exact web page names.  So I could type the following into an edit form:

Make sure to check out [My Home Page]

and the system will convert it into the special form using whoever was
the user who entered the MY part into the edit form:

Make sure to check out [My {Brad Neuberg} Home Page]

The sentence would print out on the screen as

Make sure to check out _My Home Page_

where the underscores are a hyperlink.  Anything between the {}s are not
printed out.

&gt;<i> Does it have facilities for easily creating FAQ's and project  
</I>&gt;<i> news/updates/status reports?  Or are those planned?  This was one of 
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;new&quot; things I had wanted to add to JOS's web site.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yes.  OpenPortal supports something called weblets, which are sorta like
server-side javabeans.  An example weblet would be a business card.  A
weblet is a data-object that has data for certain properties, so for the
business card this would be a Name, Organization, Phonenumber, etc.  A
weblet also provides facilities to edit and change this data-object
through a web interface, so that the weblet would provide an html form to
change this data object.  One can add a new weblet to a page by using Easy
Command Language.  To add a business card to a page I could type the
following in the edit box:

Make sure to check out my [BusinessCard].

When I saved the page the page would reload with a blank business card
embedded as html into the openportal page, with a tiny edit button next to
it.  When I hit the edit button I would get a form with fields for the
name, organization, phone number, etc.  One can have as many weblets on a
page as they want:

Everyone, please check out the [Schedule].  Also make sure to append your
contact cards here:

  [Brad Neuberg's Contact Card]
  [Ward Cunningham's Contact Card]
  [Markus Peter's Contact Card]

Please read the FAQ below:

[FAQ]

Since weblets can be any sort of structured data, a FAQ Weblet could also
be created.  Weblets are really just JavaBeans with a web interface to
display and edit them.

&gt;<i> Does it support versioning of pages (or is this planned)?
</I>
Not right now.  Eventually CVS integration is planned (this would be
OpenPortal 3).  OpenPortal 2 is what is being released at the end of June.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know you're still building the first prototype so things are a bit shakey 
</I>&gt;<i> and you probably have a long wish list too.  Just wanted to get as much 
</I>&gt;<i> info as possible.  I'd hate to do a lot of work on the current JOS web site 
</I>&gt;<i> now only to have the effort become redundant in two months.  :)
