<PRE>Greetings all,

Well I read the article, it was pretty light and fluffy and overlooked many facets of OS responsibilities and capabilities but what could you really expect from a single page of text. 

A small snippet of the text tells us:

&quot;Once the OS is irrelevant, you might as well remove it entirely
  as a distinct entity. Instead, why not fold the OS and the Java
  environment together? Right now, the Java environment runs
  as a process inside some OS. An OS with a built-in JVM can
  make much more efficient use of memory and processing
   power to run Java applications.&quot;

To me the OS will never be irrelevant. JOS (as I understand it, please correct me if i'm wrong) will still have to provide system resources coherently and securely for the Java Applications that it will execute.

The way I currently see JOS is as a small platform dependant microkernel which maps the physical system resources available into the platform independant JOS kernel which in turn provides all the necessary OS services (reliability,restartability,security,filesystems etc etc) to the many independant Java applications that execute.

Am I off the track?  Comments?

Cheers
Geoff O'Callaghan

JOSers:

There is a new editorial in the Bite Size Java column on O'Reilly's site
that laments about the lack of a good Java Operating System.  We are
mentioned as heading in the right direction but not far enough along and too
slow developing.  He makes some good points about the memory savings and
advantages that can be gained from a Java OS with an integrated kernel/jvm.
(See <A HREF="http://jos.org/wiki/view/main/WhyMultiProcessJVM">http://jos.org/wiki/view/main/WhyMultiProcessJVM</A> for my take on that.)

It is at: <A HREF="http://java.oreilly.com/news/newos_0499.html">http://java.oreilly.com/news/newos_0499.html</A>

Take a look, it is a good read.  Then write back here and let us all know
what YOU think!

Avery J. Regier
