<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 2)  How exactly does the system work?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Its still being built!  If you'd like to help, you can help to determine that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;exact question.
</I>&gt;<i> What I meant was:  Are you planning on making this system plain Command line, a GUI, or a
</I>&gt;<i> DOSSHELL like in-between command system?  Any plans on making a bash-like command shell
</I>&gt;<i> with linux-like features.
</I>
It can be any and all, were designing a pluggable UI system on the UI mailing list

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 3)  What kind of executable is used (simlpe bytecodes?)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Native micro kernel (machine dependent assembly), with java
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(bytecodes) for everything else.
</I>&gt;<i> What do you mean by this?
</I>The kernel/JVM is written in C/asm and ported to different chips, as much as possible would be in Java bytecode

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
