<PRE>Hi all,

This is to announce that the <A HREF="mailto:vote-info@jos.org">vote-info@jos.org</A> list is now available.

Why do you care?
	Well, if you are or plan to be an active participant in the JOS project 
and wish for your vote to count in important organizational issues, then 
you need to subscribe!  By subscribing to the vote-info list now you become 
registered to vote in the upcoming question on whether or not to accept the 
proposed JOS Constitution.  If the proposed Constitution is ratified, then 
the vote-info list will officially be the list of voting JOS members.  If 
you are not on this list, then your vote does not count.  This list is 
meant to be a very-low traffic list.  The ONLY posts which should be put 
onto this list are Calls For Votes and announcements of vote results.  All 
other discussion of upcoming votes should take place on other @jos.org 
lists as appropriate.  For instance, discussion about the Constitutional 
vote is taking place on the <A HREF="mailto:biz@jos.org">biz@jos.org</A> list.

What does the proposed Constitution define?
	The only thing that the Constitution defines is a voting procedure by 
which we can make binding decisions as an organization.  We need this in 
order to do such things as decide on a license.  This voting procedure is 
the exact same one that we will use to ratify the Constitution.  To get 
more information on the proposed Constitution (and the procedure we will 
use to ratify it) see: <A HREF="http://jos.org/wiki/view/main/Constitution">http://jos.org/wiki/view/main/Constitution</A> .  There 
are links there to the proposed Constitution, the accompanying PolicyBook, 
and a FAQ detailing the rationale behind the Constitution.

We will allow two months for members to register to vote by subscribing to 
the vote-info list before bringing the ratification of the proposed 
Constitution to a vote.

To subscribe to vote-info, please go to: 
<A HREF="http://jos.org/mailman/listinfo/vote-info">http://jos.org/mailman/listinfo/vote-info</A>

Also, the <A HREF="mailto:biz@jos.org">biz@jos.org</A> list is now available.  This list is specifically for 
JOS organizational discussions such as constitutional &amp; policy issues and 
our quarterly licensing discussions.  It is NOT for discussing coding 
issues of any kind, web site administration issues, or public relations 
issues.  There are other lists for those purposes.

To subscribe to biz, please go to: <A HREF="http://jos.org/mailman/listinfo/biz">http://jos.org/mailman/listinfo/biz</A>

Happy JOSing!
Avery J. Regier
