<PRE>Hi everybody

Ok these are a little bit late, ok really late ;).

On the 28th of March, I was taking to ThierryMallard about why the 
project is taking such a long time to get going.  I also talked with 
adric about the current status of the project, and about Java2/Linux 
and vmware <A HREF="http://www.vmware.com/,">http://www.vmware.com/,</A> I tried this and it looks good 
(also look out for <A HREF="http://www.freemware.org/">http://www.freemware.org/</A>).

On the 4th of April, I was taking ClarkEvans and MartinezG a little.  
I had a good talk with MattAlbrecht about drivers, ever body should 
read and comment on Matts device architecture document 
<A HREF="http://jos.org/wiki/view/main/DeviceArchitecture.">http://jos.org/wiki/view/main/DeviceArchitecture.</A>  I was also talking 
to BlaSteD a long time lurker of the wiki web site, I asked him what 
was need to make the project better (it's basically what we are 
trying to do now).

I would like to find out how many people are looking just at the wiki 
web site (like BlaSteD).  So I would like somebody to setup a pole on 
the web site, something like the on the JavaLobby site 
(<A HREF="http://www.javalobby.org/">http://www.javalobby.org/</A>), volunteers?

My logs of these meetings are available at 
<A HREF="http://jos.org/~robfitz/jos-19990404.zip">http://jos.org/~robfitz/jos-19990404.zip</A> (7 kb) and
