I never said we couldnt support bash, I even mentioned that JADE could easily have a bash CLI; and where did DOS come from?

</I>
The UI group is trying to make JADE, thats not a UI but a socket to plug any UI into. from a bash-ish CLI to a X-window-ish GUI to a whatever else. and frankly, most people dont want a CLI (Im talking
non-programmers here, I want one m'self)
 
&gt;<i> We *do* want to support scripts, right? Then why limit the command line by not
</I>&gt;<i> allowing the same syntax there as in script files? One can easily add dir, del,
</I>&gt;<i> ren etc commands to that shell if that's easier to use (not my opinion).
</I>
Yes, we do want scripts. Yes, we do want a powerful CLI. We dont want *one* though. I reccomend you look at the JADE page via Wiki.

(also: Im trying to get everyone to stick to the defs on UserInterfaceDefinitions, we've had alot of confusion over stuff like that)

	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial

	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
