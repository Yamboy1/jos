What seems to be  missing from this discussion is how you are going to 
plug different CLI's into the System. 

The shell does quite a lot of low-level work, for example bash expands 
arguments with wildcards for the local filesystem (*.wav becomes 1.wav 
2.wav 3.wav etc), it also controls where input and output are attached 
to (you can redirect input and output with &gt;,&lt;). Then it also adds its 
scripting language.

There needs to be an interface for shells to access the OS services, 
preferably one that allows multiple shells to be developed easily. It 
might even be possible to have a visual scripting environment (with a 
visual language). 

As far as the need for a scripting language goes, it will be extremely 
beneficial to include a bash-compatible shell, as this is a defacto 
standard. It will probably also be useful in other areas (eg Linux uses 
scripts to control what happens during startup).

My 3cents worth
John
