Definitley, I think we should define a language independent scripting interface so we could implememtn different script langs (although ECMA should be standard, agreed) without having to recode all
the system hooks and such. This would make it easier to script system stuff (and for scriptlangs already written you'd just need to code a few proxy classes)

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
