Exactly (all though my mom still hasnt figured out doubleclick vs. rightclick so I doubt she'd call it easy :)

ditto; personally, though, I want the four virtual desktops of X with the first being a CLI that you launch the programs with but hopefully that will be easy to do with JADE

Hmm, well if we do it right theoretically one wouldnt need a CLI period (for those used to iMacs and other electronics in custom colors ;). Again, personally, I think the best thing we can do is
create all the little components so that people can build whatever they want to (just had a flashback to using legos) and a net.installer for the first time user that lets you select the configuration
then just download the required stuff (obviosly this would be a low priority, but one nessecary for mass appeal).

I hope that made sense to everyone, because I dont think it made sense to me (up for two days, praise caffine, you see)

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
