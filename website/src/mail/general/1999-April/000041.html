That would be for the UI mailing list
 
&gt;<i> The shell does quite a lot of low-level work, for example bash expands

</I>&gt;<i> 2.wav 3.wav etc), it also controls where input and output are attached

</I>&gt;<i> scripting language.
</I>
preferebly alot of this would be done in JADE associates libraries (again, UI)
 
&gt;<i> There needs to be an interface for shells to access the OS services,
</I>&gt;<i> preferably one that allows multiple shells to be developed easily. It
</I>&gt;<i> might even be possible to have a visual scripting environment (with a
</I>&gt;<i> visual language).
</I>
A) see UserInterfaceDefinitions B) thats what JADE *is* more or less
 
&gt;<i> As far as the need for a scripting language goes, it will be extremely
</I>&gt;<i> beneficial to include a bash-compatible shell, as this is a defacto
</I>&gt;<i> standard. It will probably also be useful in other areas (eg Linux uses
</I>&gt;<i> scripts to control what happens during startup).
</I>
Ive always agreed with that (although personally Id like to use a modified Lua)

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
