<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; The other is that we hope to add database functionality to make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; things like news and status reports easier to do than with Wiki.  What
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do you think?  Discussion should be carried out on the general jos
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm. The Wiki could be improved to handle this things nicely. I'll think
</I>&gt;<i> about it.
</I>
OK.  I've actually been working on it using php and postgresql but if you 
can think of a nice way to integrate it directly into Wiki that would be 
cool too.  To avoid redundant work, we should coordinate efforts.  
Speaking of Wiki:

1. I've noticed the Wiki pages are set up for revisions of pages but its 
not actually being done.  Any plans on getting this implemented? Or is 
it and I'm just not seeing it?

2. Helmut has noticed that the Wiki is a processor hog.  I've noticed 
that there are typically &lt; 10 changes a day to the wiki.  Perhaps 
instead of doing the processing everytime a page is displayed (which 
presumably happens often) we do the normal &quot;view&quot; processing for a 
page everytime a page is changed (and unfortunately update all the 
pages everytime any page is added/deleted (can a page be deleted 
through the wiki?) which presumably happens even less often).  So Wiki 
basically only runs when a change or add/delete are done.  It generates 
static pages that are used whenever a wiki page is viewed.  The 
algorithm you'd have to develop to scan/update all pages when a new 
wiki page is created (to update links) could also be used to auto-
generate a comprehensive wiki index which is sorely needed.  Also a 
Wiki search?

3. The wiki seems inherently hard to organize because its basically a 
one layer deep, extremely bushy tree.  We basically have 6 braches:
[JOS] [KAFFE] [KORE] [JAS] [RTEMS] [PSI] 
with jos having the vast lion's share of pages 

Branch: Page Count
==============
JOS           1249
KAFFE       7
KORE        3
RTEMS      3
PSI            3
JAS           8

Can you think of anyway for us to define &quot;parent&quot; page(s) for each page 
so that they will show up in a heirarchy?  I suppose wiki could simply 
move each file to a subdirectory when moved in the wiki system.  And 
then at the top of each wiki page could be a &quot;navigation line&quot; similar to 
the one they use on big sites like Yahoo.com (i.e.  
&quot;Location:  JOS -&gt; WorkingGroups -&gt; KernelGroup -&gt; MicroKernel&quot;
with each step in the list being a link to the appropriate page).

4.  Do you (Markus) have time to hack Wiki or should I help?  Since you 
wrote wiki you can probably make these changes really fast but if you 
don't have time I can help.

&gt;<i> &gt; What do people think about me adding the navigation box at the left to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the wiki templates so it appears in all wiki pages?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I'm the creator of this Wiki and know it rather well therefore, I think
</I>&gt;<i> that maybe doing this with frames is the better idea. Otherwise the navigation
</I>&gt;<i> box maybe interferes with the Wiki content and I do not want that somebody
</I>&gt;<i> accidently damages the navigation bar with his Wiki page.
</I>
Not if its static (which I think is a &quot;good idea&quot;).  It should only point to 
major &quot;stable&quot; sections of the wiki to be useful so I don't see a problem 
with putting it into the template.  Check out:

<A HREF="http://jos.org/wiki/view/test/main">http://jos.org/wiki/view/test/main</A>

Where I've hacked a pre-existing template to include a navigation bar.  If 
we use SSI instead of hard coding it in like I've done there, we can 
simply edit one &quot;master&quot; navigation bar code fragment and it will show 
up in all wiki templates... and hence all wiki pages.  I was thinking of 
doing it for the &quot;static&quot; front end web pages anyhow.

(for test purposes only, that section of the wiki will be up and down and 
deleted so don't put things you want to keep there).
