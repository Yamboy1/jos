&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>
Sounds like a very good idea. 

One thing though that I haven't seen mentioned before with respect to the
standard commands.

What do you guys think of &quot;the bash way of doing things&quot;? That is, the command
line is just an easy way to execute scripts line by line. I think JOS should
adopt that strategy.

I just wanted to mention that, because if you guys agree, then one might have
to take a somewhat different approach when designing/implementing the
specifics. I just think it's *so* great, the way things are done in bash.

For those of you who aren't familir with Unix, bash is the (or at least one of
the) defacto standard shells. It, along with other shells, is basically an
applications that executes shell scripts. The &quot;command line&quot; is then just a
special case of shell script execution. So you can execute loops, if/else
statements and things like that on the command line, just as if it was part of
a script on file.

PS.
        How about even making the JOS shell compatible with bash, only
implemented in a different way? I know some things might be inheretedly (sp?)
hard to &quot;fit&quot; into JOS, in which case it can be skipped, but I think the syntax
of bash scripts make sense. Unless we want an object oriented shell that is.
And making it (largely) compatible, would 1) attract Unix people, and 2) make
some script-based applications/utilities easier to port.

Hmmm.

(new FileList(new FileName(&quot;*&quot;)).list(); // ??? :)
