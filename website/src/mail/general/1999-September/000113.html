its good they fixed those things, I havent downloaded or installed it
(and frankly Im burned out on downloading so its going to have to wait
awhile) but from reading the article the most useful thing to JOS is the
Runtime.setHook(Thread hook); (I'm doing that from memory, could be
wrong) that lets you make a Thread to start executing when the VM is
shutdown. Other then saving time in workarounds with System.exit() (that
wouldnt work if someone went to restart their computer anyway) this
offers us a chance to avoid yet another &quot;system event&quot;.

Cheers,
DigiGod

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
