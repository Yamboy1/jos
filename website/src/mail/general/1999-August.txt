This is a reminder that this is the last day that you can register to vote

Evidently we had a Wiki based service denial attack
_or_ the Wiki was in a hard loop.  Also, I guess someone 
else was logged in as me on the server at the time.
We need to get ssh2 installed on the server...

Subject: [JOS] RE: Problem with registering as JOS member

Max,

The Games group is not doing much of anything right now, but don't let that
fool you into thinking that JOS is dead.  In fact, JOS is about as alive now
as it has ever been, if not more so.  The current state of affairs is that a
lot of work is going on in the kernel, JVM, and drivers areas.  Just this
week, we saw the completion of our first VGA driver.  There is also
significant work going on defining core JOS services, such as JADE (a
command shell framework) and the Registry.  If you want to see how 'alive'
JOS is, subscribe to the 'arch', 'kernel' and 'ui' mailing lists.  With your
graphics interests, you might be suited to help write graphics drivers.  For
tech details, I strongly suggest subscribing to the 'kernel' list.  The
kernel writers are putting out status reports to that list every week or so.

Iain or Clark:  Could you make sure that Max has a wiki account?

Regards,
Avery J. Regier

http://www.software.ibm.com/developer/library/license.html

read this article, its on making money on opensource software; before
you say anything Im not sugggesting we do this with JOS. I am
suggesting, however, that once we get a JOS release we write an article
like this but JOS specific. whether people use it to sell apps for JOS
or redistribute it (like redhat linux) its going to mean increased
circulation for JOS... 

Cheers,
DigiGod

Subject: [JOS] Wiki temporarily relocated

Hello all,

The JOSWiki has been down for the past two weeks and due to a variety
of reasons (most related to my being out of town on vacation) it has
not been fixed.  Basically the wiki needs to be relocated to another
server.  My first attempts to move it to Clark's machine have not
worked.  I have therefore, temporarily relocated it to my server:

http://www.metamech.com/wiki

This is a highly temporary relocation until I can get it on Clark's
machine so don't bookmark pages or do anything that would get the bots
and search engines banging on the site.  I've taken this "emergency"
measure since I won't have time to work on this for another week at
least and we have gone far too long without the wiki.  Please check the
main jos web page

http://www.jos.org

for announcements regarding future relocation of the site.  Comments
and questions should be sent to me or the admin list.  

DO NOT continue this thread on the general or info lists!!! All
followups should go to the admin list or directly to me.

Subject: [JOS] JOS Constitution Vote Passes

The JOS Constitution Vote passed!

   * Title:  Ratification of Proposed JOS 
             Constitution and Policy Book
   * Type: Extraordinary
   * Proposer: Avery J. Regier 
               [ ajregier@earthlink.net ]
   * Seconder:  Robert Fitzsimons 
               [ robfitz@geocities.com ]
   * Administrator: Iain Shigeoka 
               [ iainshigeoka@yahoo.com ]

--------

Vote Results

   * 13 Votes placed
   * 46 possible Voters
   * 12 vote quorum ("extraordinary" vote (25%))
   * 12 Yes vote(s) (Passes if yes >= 66%)
   *  1 Abstain vote(s)
   *  0 No vote(s)

There were a total of 13 Votes placed during the voting period out of a
total of 46 voters subscribed to vote-info on August 2, 1999.  The 46
voter total required an ("extraordinary" vote) quorum of 12 votes
(25%).  This was met by the 13 total votes.  Of the 13 votes, 12 were
"Yes", 1 was "Abstain".  This created a greater than 66% Yes vote to
pass the Constitution.

My apologies for the late report.  Any questions regarding the vote
itself should be sent directly to me, iainshigeoka@yahoo.com.  Any
discussions regarding this result should be made to the appropriate
mailing list (do not reply to all three lists in this crosspost).

Java 1.3 is up for beta, its still called Java 2 to aid confusion;
anyway, here's the JW article that gives you the gist of the situation:
