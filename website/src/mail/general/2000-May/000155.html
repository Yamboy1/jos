Here's my write-up. It's a bit higher level than your bit. It starts off
by talking about the basic architecture: kernel -&gt; JVM -&gt; Java layer.
I've created my javalobby account so I can post it whenever (the sooner
the better since our story is scrolling off the front page already).

In addition to Robert's introduction, I would like to give a brief
overview of the parts of JOS which I have been working on. An important
goal of JOS is to provide a highly efficient kernel so that most of the
operating system code can be written in the Java language itself. I use
the term kernel to refer collectively to the actual kernel and the JVM.
Our JVM is written by _Quinn (Todd Miller) and is currently built on top
of the JJOS kernel, written by John Morrison.

My focus is on the Java layer of JOS which implements the user/security
model and much of the process architecture, including inter-process
communication. My research so far has mainly revolved around how to
implement multiple processes, how to save memory when different
processes are using the same class files (without violating the spec),
and how to support inter-process communication using object sharing as a
primitive. My original proposal, which is old but still relevant, is at:

	<A HREF="http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/jos/java_processes.txt">http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/jos/java_processes.txt</A>

_Quinn (a major participant in the brainstorming phase) will give a more
up to date perspective on processes as it relates to his Virtual
Machine.

Since all people ask is &quot;show me the code!&quot;, yes, I do have some code
available. rheise.os (name change pending :-) is a multiple process Java
execution environment designed to handle processes on top of _Quinn's
JVM, but based on a flexible architecture that also supports execution
on top of a standard JVM (to the extent that is possible). A screenshot
of the next release is available at:

	<A HREF="http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/projects/rheise.os/rheise.os-0.1.4-pre1-screenshot.gif">http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/projects/rheise.os/rheise.os-0.1.4-pre1-screenshot.gif</A>

Yes, that's a pure Java window manager (replacement AWT Toolkit using
Swing as its backend). I have not yet released the code to this version
(wait 'till the weekend), but the current version is available at:

	<A HREF="http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/projects/rheise.os/">http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/projects/rheise.os/</A>

Be warned that it is only known to work on JDK 1.1.x for Linux with
Swing 1.1.x. If you notice anything not working in release 0.1.3,
version 0.1.4 will be a vast improvement (for instance, SwingToolkit
(the replacement AWT Toolkit) actually sort of works in 0.1.4, as
demonstrated in the screenshot).
