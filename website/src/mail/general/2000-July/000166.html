Why not use one of those methods?  Is there any reason to avoid this

</I>
Sounds like the perfect place to use RMI Activation as provided
for by rmid.  It's especially well suite to daemon processes as
you describe.  I personally would use Jini with Activation to
provide dynamic, loosely coupled, &quot;federations&quot; of services.

&gt;<i> Or does JOS provide another environment where apps are running in?
</I>
JOS is not ready for such use.  When it is, we plan on supporting
the entire standard java platform which includes rmi, tcpip, and
on top of it, activation and Jini.
