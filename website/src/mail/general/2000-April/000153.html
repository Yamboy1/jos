<PRE>After a fascinating discussion on the <A HREF="mailto:arch@jos.org">arch@jos.org</A> list about how to
support multiple processes and IPC in JOS, I have finally put together
what could become a foundation for the Java layer of JOS:

...
rheise.os is a multiple process Java execution environment that can run
on top of a standard JVM (with limited support) or on top of a Java
Operating System kernel with native hooks to support multiple processes.
It is intended to be used with the JOS kernel, in which case the
rheise.os package prefix may be changed to jos.

rheise.os provides an API for managing processes, users and security in
a Java Operating System. This functionality is supported both when
running on a host JVM and when running on a native kernel, thus allowing
JOS developers to work on the upper layers of the operating system
architecture before the kernel is complete.
...

Currently you can run multiple process in separate namespaces on a
standard JVM. There is a sample program that demonstrates the security
model employed. In addition, I have included a simple window manager and
desktop environment based on swing's JDesktopPane. This only half works,
so contributors are welcome.

Please forgive the lack of docs, and lack of comments, and lack of code
in some parts :-) It's late Sunday night over in this part of the world
(Australia) so this release is sort of a rush job before the work week
starts...

I hope we will start to see some more programming activity on the JOS
architecture from here on.

Please direct follow-up posts to <A HREF="mailto:arch@jos.org">arch@jos.org</A> only.
