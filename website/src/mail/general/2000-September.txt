Subject: [JOS] Privacy and Security on JOS

I have been a member of project JOS for nearly two years, and have
witnessed many conversations (either through these mailing lists or on
the wiki) regarding security on JOS; platform security, higher-level
security, cryptography and authentication, and other details.

Many times someone has argued that JOS is an OS targeted at end users.
This means that someone can use JOS without having to be a developer.
Taken on a further step, JOS has to be developed *and* supported in such
a way that these end users can feel comfortable installing it.

It is obvious that installation, runtime and upgrade must be easy, and
very automated, so that they can be accomplished by people that do not
know how JOS works, nor can find out how it works by looking at the
source code (or looking at it in general, for that matter).

Apart from that, I would like to bring to your attention another matter
that should interest end users, and that's his (her) on-line privacy. By
privacy, at least at an OS level, I would mean the capability of a user
choosing who will have what access to the resources on his JOS system.

I have knowledge of two basic OS's which fail, at various levels, to
accomplish this: Linux and Windows.

Linux is very often found on a multi-user system, which means that a
user is at risk of attacks he cannot know about, and cannot counter. A
user on a remote Linux system is as vulnerable as his administrator is,
which is not secure enough: he does not control the security of his
system. On JOS, given the use of Java, virtual little sandboxes can be
created, so that each user can control the security of his own
resources, no matter what mistakes someone else might make.

Windows generally sucks, and being an NT user (not my choice) I have had
to install tens of components to secure (really?) my ports, disks, keys,
etc. That is unacceptable for an OS: security should be controlled by
the OS' security subsystem, not by user applications filling up ports
and holes here and there.

That is why I wish to point out the importance of "advertising" JOS as
not only a secure OS, but a very private one. The workstation, server,
distributed network node and game machine tend to co-exist in systems,
and I can't see why they will cease in the future; thus, it is best that
a user knows he is - and feels - that his privacy is respected by the OS
and the network it is connected to.

Very interesting.  Can you elaborate or is there a wiki article on how jos 
could be used to create such a private computing environment?  I think I 
know what you're talking about but can't be sure.

Unfortunately I have not created a Wiki page as I do not have the time
to maintain it. I will, though, try to elaborate a little:

1) The system part should be different from the administration part
which should be different from the user part. This means that there are
a few things that only the system can do, such as create security
sandboxes, flag code as privileged, have direct access to memory, etc.
The administration part can set security policies and run processes that
stay alive after a user has logged off. The users can only play around
with their own stuff, even if that is code being executed inside the
same VM as the system code (which is an obvious case in JOS).

2) All communication through any port must support various levels of
security, such as having the JOS system start with a pre-defined local
proxy server and firewall, so administrators and users can set their
incoming *and* outgoing policies for all ports of communication.

3) Encryption should not be facilitated by third party software, but
should be an integral part of JOS, at, say, filesystem level. Each user
follows an authentication method based on PKI, and disks are encrypted
with conventional encryption based on each user's preferences.

A basic idea is this:

Each user has a user id (string) and a password (string-hashed). The
system also stores a UID (string) and a system UID (string). It also
generates a temporary ID called, say, temporary (string). Authentication
is like this:

LOGON

Gather credentials:

password + user-uid + user-name + system-uid + temporary

Use credentials to create PBE cipher for DESede.

Use cipher to decrypt user's private DH/DSS key.

Create PKI cipher with private DH/DSS key.

Use cipher to decrypt user's symmetric DESede key.

Use symmetric DESede key to decrypt user's profile information.

Begin session.


LOGOFF

Encrypt user's profile directory with symmetric key.

Create new temporary UID and write to disk.

Gather credentials from memory but with updated temporary UID.

Create symmetric DESede cipher with above via PBE.

Encrypt with above cipher the private DH/DSS key.

Store encrypted private key to disk.

Empty stored credentials, private and symmetric keys from memory.

End session.


As you can see, this way eliminates the danger of others brute forcing
into the system (PKI can be DSS 4096 bits and symmetric can be DESede
128 bit), nobody can recover with private key without knowledge of
password.

If user uses the same password in many accounts throughout the Internet,
the system UID and the user UID will obfuscate the hash.

Also, the temporary UID which is random will give an attacker as much
time to brute force as the user needs to log in again. A new encryption
key is generated upon the termination of each session, which would mean
nobody would even think of starting a brute force attack.


Even if the user's password was compromised, there is still a little
safety, as the only way to obtain the system UID and the temporary UID
is by having physical access to the JOS box (assuming a Java VM or VM
with no pointers).

Temporary UID's will be generated by very good sources of entropy, too,
as nobody will know when the user terminates his session, nor the
parameters of the entropy sources at that instant. Deleting old keys and
the UID's by wiping them multiple times helps prevent their recovery and
statistical attacks on the system. The private key is re-written to disk
in enciphered state every time the user logs off, so recovery even by
means of physical access should be impossible. Otherwise the private key
remains *ONLY* in JOS memory space with absolutely no access to anything
but the system security module. Let's say these private keys are only
for decrypting the symmetric key used to protect the user's files, then
it can be generated by the system, and the user won't even have access
to it, which enhances its security. And since the user can't use it
outside of the specific JOS box, no clear text attacks can be performed.
There you go.


Don't you think the above system is quite protective for most users?
Please let me stress the word "users" as I cannot speak for truly strong
security without having an implementation of JOS to play around with.
Yet.

Yes, this is very interesting.  It's always been my opinion that, 
practically speaking, user security beyond a very simple scheme will always 
fall prey to poor password choice and other user failings long before the 
need to resort to attacks on the security system itself.  It's amazing how 
many people will send you their password if you just send them an email 
asking for it.  That being said, the OS should provide the best user 
security possible so that users that are security savvy will be 
protected.  The concept of a user in java though is also a new concept 
(java-wise) that needs to be worked out in JOS.

While I agree with what you're saying, I'd just like to point out what I
believe to be a  flaw in the kind of profile management you seem to be
proposing (whether by intent or not - it doesn't matter, I think this issue
should be brought up in any case).

Am I correct in thinking that the idea is that upon login, the profile
(applications settings, etc - something like the user specific registry info
on Windows?) gets loaded, possible changed by running programs, and then
stored again on disk when one logs out?

The problem with this is that it interferes with multiple logins. This is a
problem one sees in a Windows environment with roaming profiles. When a
person logs onto a NT box, the client will get update it's local profile
with that on the server. When you log out, the server profile is
synchronized with the client-side one. This obviously creates huge problems
with regards to being logged in multiple times from different locations (and
then there's the problem of re-transfering a 500 mail file on the net
everytime it changes... but that's besides the point).

So while the idea of sessions is obviously a requirement (and a great thing
if you make them persistent across logins), I believe any "profile" data
should be accessed directly on disk (or wherever the "authorative" copy resides).

You are quite correct in guessing what I had in mind. After developing
the Registry API (inverted tree like structure) I thought of this
scheme. The registry supports merging and synchronization, and it can
run seamlessly in distributed applications, or many concurrent user
sessions.

> The problem with this is that it interferes with multiple logins.

Not really... As long as there is at least one active session, no
encryption and saving to the disk will be made (unless, of course, for
matters of caching, buffering, etc., etc.). When all sessions of a
specific user have been terminated or died (network time-out, for
example), then the user's profile is considered "inactive" and will be
securely stored to disk (or whatever other medium).

> <snip> I believe any "profile" data should be accessed directly on

Indeed, and with my model it will be so, just that there will exist a
transparent layer between user application and user profile data on
disk: secure encryption. That is part of the system, and as I suggested
in my original e-mail, I would be happy if this was done at file system
level - system core at the most. Not even administrators should have
access to this, on the VM and the JOS security monitor.

Ah okay; with one single "shared" profile (shared as in shared between
active sessions) my argument is indeed void. Thanks for clearing that up for
me.

Hello

The log for todays meeting is a available at
<URL:http://www.metamech.com/wiki/view/Main/Logs>.

There was a small technical discussion about JJOS/decaf, what class
libraries it could use, and the use of native code.  Quinn gave and
status update on sfWiki and decaf.  I also talked a little about my JVM
and asked if it would be worth starting again on a combined effort to
create a JVM.

Iain investigated what was needed to setup a non-profit entity, and we
talked about the issues involved.  We felt that in the short term there
isn't that great a need for a non-profit entity, but we will keep doing
some investigation.

We are planing to have a meeting every two weeks for the next month or
two to work on some organization issues.  The next meeting will be on
Sunday the 17th of September, 2000 at 17:00 UTC, in the jos channel on
the Undernet IRC Network.

Subject: [JOS] The JOS Project?

Hi everybody

Around this time of the year three years ago on the old JavaLobby
forums, the idea of creating an operating system based on the Java
programming language was discussed, out of this discussion the JOS
project started.

Now over those years the JOS project has remained quite small with the
number of active contributes staying about the same.  But interest is
still quite high with new people joining all the time, but there has
been just as many leaving as joining.  I believe this is because there
has been very little progress as a group, although some individuals have
made quite a bit of progress.

Now I have always promoted the idea of there being multiple
implementation of every component.  With the best being chosen by
natural selection, but this hasn't worked each component is too strong
and just won't die.  The problem with this is that the whole project
will die off because new members don't know where to start and then
leave.

So far each developer has worked on there own project with little help
from other developers, and nobody wants to give up there project and
work on someone else's.

Now for this to change we need to all stop working on our own projects
and work together on a new unified project.  We should treat all the
current project as prototypes and leave them behind, and just bring all
the good ideas with us on the new unified project.

For this to succeed we need to jump into the deep-end, new mailing
lists, web site, cvs server.  We can keep the old stuff around but only
for reference.

So what do we all think, comments, flames, ideas, are all welcomed.

Hi,

I am someone who probably fits the picture you paint. I found the project a
few years ago and have been half monitoring bits of it here and there. I
was put off by a number of things and eventually gave up - so maybe my
thoughts may be of interest

At 03:00  18/9/00 -0400, you wrote:

I have always disliked this approach segregation of projects is rarely a
good idea. So much more can be learnt by cooperating and building together.
Sometimes it is impossible to fix the old version and you have to change
from evolution to revolution. In many cases the new project will fall short
or die out but sometimes it survives and is actually better.

At apache we allow a seperate proposal to be active in the CVS tree and
different people can talk over the second bit (or alternatively the
branch). Sometimes parts of the proposal will be merged into main trunk and
sometimes proposal branch will just be an ideas testing fround. Interesting
approach and seems to work. It also creates a lot less friction if multiple
developers want to work in same area.

I am usually also deadly opposed to people including their own names into
projects (ie rheise-os or whatever it was called) because it implies less a
group. It is a better idea to come up with code-names.

>So far each developer has worked on there own project with little help

One thing I noticed here is that there is faaaaar to much re-invention of
the wheel. I saw a lot of projects mentioned that were started but never
finished but were almost 100% identical to external projects. 

You should standardise as much across the projects using external tools if
neccesary. Theres a build tool here when there is the far superior Ant
(jakarta.apache.org) or you have rewritten scripting tools when there is
already a large number of java scripting languages around (BSF includes
javascript, python, lisp, tcl etc).

Internally you should restructure to all work together and ideally work
with external teams. I am not sure how much of code can be shared between
the VMs here and other VMs but it is worth looking and trying to shared
code at least.

+1

thats always a good thing - it mean frictions at the start but in long run
maybe better.

Another thing to consider is making consistency across all the projects.
Currently copyright is assigned to various people and licensing is
different etc. It is much better to assign copyright to a non-profit
organisation as that means if the owner of code leaves the rest of team are
not screwed. You could look for a sponsor group if you don't want problems
of setting up jos.org - there are a few around.

Another thing to consider carefully is copyright. GPL and LGPL are
extremely bad for java programmers - because of javas linking model
LGPL==GPL and that is why many gnu java libraries have modified LGPL. 

Another thing with the licensing is that it will determine who can and will
work with you. For instance GPL means that many commercial bodies will
simply not be able to touch it - unless it is a complete product because
they have too much to loose. BSD-like licenses however see a lot of input
from commercial people. At apache (which uses APL a BSD-like license) there
are some projects where 3-4 or more of the people are payed to work on the
projects part time. This does great things for code - and also some bad
things. Sometimes the commercial guys try and do hacky things because have
a deadline looming. Of course you have to have some strong willed people to
keep you on trac aka Design Nazis :P.

So unless you want to be product complete before you try and get people
payed to work on it then some of the other licenses should be considered
before L/GPL

It may also be worth drawing up a project guidelines on how projects are
run like http://jakarta.apache.org/guidelines/index.html. 

Also another thing that I would consider important is homogenizing
web-pages. It is damn near impossible to find anything as it is currently
setup - and if you stumble across the page - you are not sure if it is up
to date or obsolete or even used anymore.

Another good idea would be to standardize layout of directories in each
project and seperate projects out into seperate well explained modules. 

Personally I don't think a Wiki approach is the *right* approach - at least
not for this. It is too damn hard to maintain, manage, navigate and
standardize. 

If you were to do this sort of thing I would gladly join up. FWIW I am
currently working on Avalon Server framework at apache. Currently there is
only a few applications built on top of it but soon many of other Avalon
projects will switch to it. 

In the future I plan to finish a MessageServer (NNTP/SMTP/IMAP4/POP3),
start a FileServer (FTP/Free-net style/ Revision control in built) and
write a simple DNS resolver + dns server.

This I hope will be completed by March - at least that when I pencilled in
deadline and I will be getting payed to dev this stuff. I als have a lot of
stuff like echo/discard/other minor protocols during testing ideas on
Avalon. If you were to offer support for multiple users I would also gladly
do an ident server :P

Of course this is all under APL so it would have to be compatable with
whatever license you choose. I guess if I was in your position I would
force all non-native-VM stuff to be something either Mozilla or BSD like
but thats up to you :P

Theres my thoughts - hope I didn't offend anyone too much :P

BTW if you are standardising projects structure you may want to wait until
end of november as I am trying to get a standard layout that all projects
conform to defined at Apache. If that is the case then it will slowly
trickle out - many of the other java projects rely on Apache tools and will
gradually conform. 


Cheers,

Pete

Sun has a nice system for managing parts of the Java platform: expert
groups. My suggestion is that we use something like the JSR's and form
expert groups, and have their proposals voted upon by members of JOS,
and thus accept or decline proposals. Once the proposals have been
accepted, the expert group will interact closely with a general
coordinating group who will see that all components can be integrated
and follow common specification (from namespaces to coding style).

We should form a group of people who are determined to make JOS succeed,
and who have the *general* knowledge and skills to put together an OS.
Then, other groups can form their own expert groups to create the
components that will ultimately form JOS.

This is quite very true. Personally, I have kept e-mails of over five
people who had volunteered to help me with the system registry API. Two
of them actually downloaded the API (version 1.0.0 beta) but none have
ever responded since... I developed the initial API with the hopes that
people would help me with their expertise in fields not so familiar to
me (distribution, for instance) but one have come forth yet. On the
mailing lists, so many people had suggestions and showed interest...
This either means that a) we don't really have that many motivated
developers on the mailing lists, or b) nobody dares to speak of JOS in
the holistic view and try to see how components can be integrated.

Even when we had a prototype process manager, and the registry and file
system components could be very well integrated, that attempt also
failed.

Again, I hope everyone can see how a JSR mechanism can help here. If all
ideas are formulated and posted within the boundaries of a common
proposal template, then it will be easy to read, understand, vote and
monitor ideas.

This is a good idea. The Wiki is useful, but there is no real
organization strength behind it. The versioning must be made where and
when it is useful. A hierarchy of information must be created. We need
to separate news, discussion, reading material and implementation. The
Wiki seems a bit too chaotic to serve such a huge project as an OS.

Regarding leaving all behind, I would just like to point out that all
user-level applications should not be left out, but continue being
listed. User-level applications do not hinder the development of the
underlying OS, nor do they complicate the API's (they are not API's -
you see).




I hope this message will help JOS, if not at least incite something that
will eventually help the project.

I think its a great approach but too much work for us.  We're having 
trouble keeping people involved without any more over head.  If JOS 
actually had a functional system, then I can see how this organization 
would really help.  And I think we really should be actively thinking about 
how to set this up.  But practically speaking I don't think we have the 
number of developers needed to really need this.

In all honesty, I think we really just need a few really bull-headed people 
to take this thing by the horns and set a direction for the group.  The 
number one problem seems to be lack of ownership.  The project started out 
as a committee idea and so no one person is "THE DESIGNER".  And most of us 
are a bit too polite and cautious to really just take the reigns.  I'd 
really like to see someone just say, I'm officially JOS Desktop and I say 
JOS is linux + Xwindows + kaffe + JOS Desktop (a java window manager) and 
then design it, recruit helpers, and build it.  And someone else to say, 
I'm officially JOS Kernel and I say JOS is decaf + jjos + classpath.  In 
addition, I think we have people that could and would do that already, but 
most of them are just too busy with other things to be able to be that person.

Yes.  This is part of the web update suggestion already in the queue.  I 
think its already been "approved" in that we discussed in during the jos 
meetings and everyone gave it a +1.  The task should naturally fall on me 
but I've been very busy at work and spending all my limited spare time 
trying to stay away from the computer!  :)

I promise to address it soon though.

Agreed.  The current tactic I would propose is to tell every one to create 
separate SourceForge projects, that link back to JOS.  JOS's website will 
create a link directory going back to the individual sourceforge 
projects.  Sound reasonable?

Agreed.  This particular case came about because no-one could come up with 
a name.  ;)  And now rheise.os has really split from jos so it further 
complicates the issue.

Agreed again.  Much of JOS was started in the hurly-burly days when java 
was really going crazy.  Most of the time, there were a dozen alternatives 
with the same functionality and jos seemed to absorb one from each for each 
major function point.  The lack of focus at jos I think made the more 
focused, stand-alone competitors more appealing for both developers and users.

it's high time to do the rounds and try and collaborate again though.

Yup.  Copyright has always been a problem with JOS.  I've always leaned 
towards a BSD license but we could never agree on anything.  Once again, 
this is probably mostly a matter of biting the bullet and doing 
this.  There are core developers that will get pissed off and leave no 
matter what decision is made though which is why the decision has never 
been made.

That's great.  Can you ping the list when that's ready so we can eval it?

The only problem/question being that its going to take a big effort to 
really kick start a restart (or a throw away of the throw away 
prototype).  Do we have the manpower for that right now?  I personally am 
stretched a bit thin currently so don't know how much I can give to the effort.

This idea might necessitate a "junta" to pull off, but maybe that's
something to think about. Let's just elect a president. Maybe a six-month
stint? It doesn't have to be time consuming if the prez is willing to lose
a few people for the sake of a strong backbone. So? People will always
flock to a group with a backbone, people want and need direction, so the
few losers who want to leave are probably part of the problem anyways. Adios!

I think there should be a benevolent monarchy, supported by a benevolent
senate. Call 'em a prez so it doesn't ruffle feathers. It doesn't take a
LOT of work, or time, to make decisions. You just have to think what's best
for the group and then say that's what it will be. Oh ... Joe's messaging
queue architecture is better, faster, and small than Pete's. Hmmm. Joe
wins, we implement it his way. Sorry Pete, let's talk about where else your
design might make sense.

What's that? It doesn't fit the current constitution? Benevolent
Revolution. Put up a new set of rules.

And you've got amazing coders walking away or languishing because of noisy
talkers. Why people don't tell each other to be quiet amazes me. There is a
strong arguement that says "politeness" is either a myth or a subtle form
of arrogance. Take your pick.

The lesson comes from ancient greece. When Sparta and Athens were at war,
Athens had JUST kicked off the "experiment" they called "democracy". It was
only 50 years old. So they all got out on the battle field and did what?
Elect Generals for the Day. Every day they'd have a different general,
seven per week, you had to be fair, and the big tent in the middle of the
compound was where all the Generals went to to haggle about which Spartan
that Johny should spear so they could make recommendations, and second
them. But ... they were getting creamed bad.


So what did Athens do to save democracy. (This really is history folks!)
They remembered things were LESS FAIR, but MORE EFFICIENT under a monarchy.
So they elected a General they liked whose duration of command would be the
whole length of engagement, or until they decided to properly replace him
with another. The guy they picked as mediocre, but had general support, and
he won the defense of Athens quite dramatically.

The point is that democracy is good for raising taxes and building roads,
but in some places it HURTS. Liike big software projects. For all the talk
of how the bazar is so super-duper, Linus and Larry Wall prove centralized
command is what seperates the mobs from the organized development projects.
Someone needs to be "point".

Let's take licensing ...

Many many moons ago I stopped working with JOS because I became exhausted
over the licensing thing, which kept coming up, and up, and up. And still
keeps coming up. Etc.

JUST ADOPT THE LGPL, THE GLP, THE NLP, THE MPL, OR WHATEVER.

Just say "its going to be this way." Period. If it makes the monarch's job
any easier, they can feel better ask the three or four guys who's code they
respect the best: hey, should we go GPL or LGPL or what? And then RESPECT
their opinion. And then just put your foot down and say its going to be
this way or that. Discussion? Okay. Two days of discussion and THEN I make
the overruling binding decision. Everyone speak up. Personally, if I don't
like the way licensing works I'll go somewhere I do. Fine. If you want tons
of people choose LGPL. Just CHOOSE.

But the way it is now, so much non-coding talk talk talk surrounds dump
decisions that you could make in five minutes, you drive guys like me away.
And you've got the loudest squeekers getting all the attention and getting
their way, who produce no code. A president or monarch could just make any
old random choice ... like "I choose A for JOS" ... and if it turns out it
should have been B ... "Oops. We are now changing from A to B. Only do B
from now on."  At least you end up knowing SOMETHING.,

This is much better than "Maybe GPL", "no GPL sucks I can prove it", "how
about LGPL", "My brother tried it and it failed", "How about JOS-PL?",
"Nah, its proprietary." "That won't work" whine whine whine for year after
year after year. Jeez.

Anyone who doesn't like it will leave. Fine. Those who stay will have the
comfort of strong decision.

This is all old-fashioned leadership stuff. Some one person needs to stand
up and take charge.

I nominate Iain Shigeoka for President. Why not? Where's my bumper sticker?

OB

Even though I am more observer than anything, I agree wholeheartedly !
Next month JOS will be 3 years old and proof that sandbox politics don't
produce the results that we envisioned.

As we have seen, they don't evoke loyalty either. Most likely there
would be fewer good people leaving even if the elected scapegoat was an
arrogant tyrant, and with a decent president things would finally solidify.

Ian has been around long enough, and I believe he has earned enough
respect that he could carry it off as the first elected president of JOS.
If Ian is willing to stand for it, I second the motion.

Theres a certain amount of consolidating occuring at Jakarta apache
project. They are slowly aquiring projects that should fulfill all your
java orientated building needs.

Currently it has a build tool (Ant), they are moving JUnit to it (Unit
testing framework), as well as a logging framework (either log4j or one of
a few other potentials), they have general regular expression libs (both
ORO and regexp) etc. They are still missing a few tools (code
formatter/beautifier, installshield) but mostly they will aquire them
eventually. Combine that with the Bean Scripting Framework (OSS from IBM
that acts as interface engine for some of javascript, python interpreters)
and you have a complete build envionment. They also have all tools to build
documentaion from XML sources.

So they are good places to at least start looking also look at
www.jpython.org and www.mozilla.org for nice scipt engines.

I guess you will always loose people but you will also gain people by
consolidating. It may even be worth having a split license - GPL/LGPL for
jvm/os/classlibraries. BSD for execution environment and the rest - this
will allow you the most reuse as most JVMc/classlibraries are GPL and most
other stuff on top of that isn't.

We don't, but if we use the JSR mechanism as a standard way of
presentation, then more people can easily join later on. See, the expert
group could be just one person, the submitter. When more people come,
the group will be larger. Anyway, we have documents like JSR's on the
Wiki, and a single name as the owner of the project (I remember making a
page for the registry myself, but am not very sure). Let's make these
formal, along with the process of standardizing the JOS website.

Quite true... Maybe there is something we could do about this. Let's
assume that JOS does not belong to anyone, and it belongs to everyone.
Let's also assume that people who are already members (their name
appears in the member list on the Wiki) have priority over future
members or those who are not in the member list. Now, let's compile a
list of people who believe they are capable of being bull-headed and
grasping the thing by the horns, but are too polite to do that. Let this
list be available on the Wiki, and let anyone who already has his name
on the member list put his name (regular Wiki editing procedure).

Let this list be on public display for a month or two, and then lock it.
Then keep it in display, and request a veto from anyone who has his name
on the member list. If, after two or three months this list is up nobody
claims that he does not like the people who are on the list, then let
these people be the "owners" or at least the people who can take the big
decision in JOS.

Although this is not the most democratic procedure, at least its
initialization seems very fair. Everyone will have a chance to be one of
those people, and everyone will have a chance to object. After that, the
group will be responsible for admitting more people.

The owner of jos.org (I guess we should consider you, as you do the
HTML, right?) must be in this group. Apart from that, I hope Gilbert
will be on it (he has made the CD distributions, after all). Also, I
think it would be reasonable that the few people who contribute very
regularly to general@jos.org should be on this list, as they have had
more experience in working with each other (well, at least discussing
with each other).


What do you think people?

I understand how time hinders everyone, on a personal level.
Standardizing something three years after its creation and three years
of web chaos can be hard. I will volunteer to help, if you wish, and I
would also like to make a public call to anyone with good designing
skills to also help. Maybe if each of us created a sample of the
organization and design of a new JOS website, and then formed a small
group that worked to implement it, things would be faster and easier for
you.

It sure does. And it does not have to be a SourceForge project, it can
be anything. The JOS website should only contain things related to JOS,
no separate projects (except for a few links, of course). Just because
the JOS distribution may contain certain Java applications, it does not
mean that these applications should be confused with JOS. Let's keep JOS
pure and make sure that all we do is an operating system. If someone
wishes to make a JOS distribution along with other applications, then
let's think about that only *after* JOS starts existing.

We'll have to simply start, even if it means only one person working.
Even if one HTML page is written per day, it is better than naught.
Unfortunately I can see that there has been little pressure to finish
work, on programming and website level, so the only way is to get
"slowly but gradually". IMO, at least.

ug - anything but a single head. I have seen sooo many projects die off
because the head decides they are bored with project or has too little time
to give to it. It is necessary for leadership but it should a group of some
sort whether its a senate, a council, a cabal or whatever - just people
whos main concern is the good of jos. People can step down from it or get
nominated to ascend but only if they have good of project in mind.

You should make sure that the council can always "close" a vote - ie don't
have an even number of people - make sure in cases of equality that the
absenting voters are forced to vote - or are allowed to propose another take.

Not stand up and take charge - hopefully a group elected by those here that
are committers. Say you have a council of 3 - make sure the votes are taken
and these three are given power to enact any changes - ie make them able to
make everyone GPL or MPL or BSD or X or Y. Make them able to decide where
copyright should be assigned etc

Subject: [JOS] JOS President

Hello all,

OK.  I think we have somewhat of a consensus that JOS the organization "as 
it is" is broken.  At least, a bunch of yea's and no nay's.  I agree with 
everyone that the best new tactic will probably be a benevolent dictator or 
small cabal to provide much more focus and to get the ball rolling once again.

For the long term, I agree that a cabal is the best solution to avoid a 
variety of problems.  For the near term, just to "make things happen" and 
to really break from committee mode, it may not be a bad idea to actually 
target going with a transitional "president" who will act as the leader 
(delegating of course) for a defined and limited time period.  6 months 
seems reasonable.  As they say, there's nothing like having a dictator for 
gettin things done.  The end of that period will see a formal election of a 
cabal to replace the president (with a chairman so people can point fingers 
when someone says, "who's in charge").

I am flattered that I've gotten votes to be the president.  And I will be 
willing to fill that role.  However, I think such a drastic change should 
at least be discussed as widely as possible amongst the jos membership to 
see if there is disagreement.  In addition, there should be a process for 
people to nominate other people as president candidates (including 
themselves).  Gee.  On the other hand, that sounds exactly like the process 
that is currently bogging down JOS in inactivity and loss of 
developers.  I'm a bit torn between "fair" and having things move 
expeditiously.

As far as the website and JSR's I think both are an excellent idea.  And 
they're critical to the re-org of JOS.  I'm currently looking for a new 
website home with an EJB server so we can do EJB/servlet development so the 
website can exploit all these java programmers we have!  :)

So the current big question is: should we be fair and go through a process, 
or just elect someone amongst us on the mailing list, and start making 
changes?  I'm currently leaning towards electing someone as a transitional 
"president" for 6 months to just get a "shakedown" going and reshape JOS as 
best as we can.  If this causes a problem (we get a large negative reaction 
from the membership) we go back and do it with the normal JOS voting 
procedure (a 2 month process as I recall).

So, votes for electing a 6 month transitional president: (+1 yes, 0 
abstain, -1 no)

My vote: +1

Yeah, prez! Do we at least get bumper-stickers or something?

... something that might help: if you call for a "two-week general

this would essentially constitute a general election, but would get it done
faster, since those who snooze would lose.

I do agree that we need a short term project leader (president), but I
would make the term only three months.  I think three months is plenty
of time to turn start turning the project around, and start the process
of voting for a real board.

Even still, one yes vote.

Not saying that we'd need a Linus Torvalds, but some kind of leader of
some sort. A president sounds good.

Now, I've been on this list for over two years, made a couple of shy
attempts to engage myself in the projects, without much success. So please
send me where most of the help is needed, I have 5 years of experience in
Java, mostly doing server-side work like designing and writing application
servers (where notions like processes are implemented). But if more help
is needed in the low-level arena, my C isn't too rusty and I am familiar
with the requirements of an operating system. So someone please put me to
work! :)

I don't really mind who will be the president (as long as he is from
this list and contributes, and we all know who are the people that
contribute - and if not, we can run a statistical analysis on the
archives of the list). Also, if there will be a group that has control
over JOS, I would be interested in the responsibility myself (but not
president or anything close to as high).


May I point out a few things that I think we should do?


1) Find a procedure that will enable us in the immediate future
(something like, say, two weeks?) to select who will be the ultimate
ruler of JOS right now.

2) Find a procedure that will enable us in the near future (how about
two months?) to select a team that will be the rulers of JOS.

3) Use this team to establish JOS policy in all aspects.

4) Create an all new web site for JOS.

5) For groups, delegate works and start producing and integrating.

As I was instrumental in getting our Constitution set up, I have a certain
feeling that we shouldn't try to contravent it so easily.  It was set up so
that there is a clear procedure for settling disagreements and ratifying
binding decisions.  Such a drastic change as this, should at least
reasonably abide by the Constitution.

According to the Constitution, the minimum that we could have an elected
President would be 17 days.  7 days to advertise the vote and 10 days for
the actual voting to take place.  That is if we define this as an 'ordinary'
vote that doesn't change the Constitution.  This will settle point 1 below.
We can then figure out how we want to change the Constitution to set up the
'cabal'.  That vote will require 14+20 days.

The biggest problem with such a vote are points 4.10-12 of the Constitution.
They state that there can only be three possible votes:  yes, no, and
neither.

In order to reasonably keep this vote within the Constitution, I propose to
word the vote as follows:
	The JOS Project shall be led by a President.  The President shall
have the power to: [whatever powers we wish to grant]
	Please vote [yes/no/neither]:

	Reason for Neither vote:


	If this vote passes with a 'yes' vote, I elect the following person
to the position of President: 
	A> Iain
	B> Someone else.
	C> etc.

The nominations for President can take place on the vote-info list during
the 7 day advertisement period.

In order for this to happen, we need a neutral administrator of the vote, a
person to propose the vote, and a seconder.  All of the above people need to
be members of the vote-info list.  If we figure out what powers the
President should have, we can start the procedure immediately and have a
President within 20 or so days.

What is above is the qualification on my +1.

Regards,
Avery J. Regier

	3) Use this team to establish JOS policy in all aspects.

	4) Create an all new web site for JOS.

	5) For groups, delegate works and start producing and integrating.

OK!

It sounds like this is a go then.  I know its a rush so people away from 
their desks for a few days will probably dislike the haste but I feel its 
important to keep the momentum going.  In this spirit, we should definitely 
get this president issue concluded.  I agree that we can and should use the 
constitution since 2 weeks is fast enough (I forgot about ordinary votes 
which are so much shorter).

For those of you who aren't, subscribe to vote-info.  I'm going to whip up 
a vote proposal (on VoteInfo in the wiki) and post it to the wiki asap and 
officially start the voting procedure.  7 days from today, we'll hold the 
vote.  10 days after, we'll hopefully have a president and roadmap for the 
future.  Note, as is usual, the initial vote proposal is just that, a 
proposal and I hope very much that people will comment and help to tweak it 
before voting on it goes forward.

Would you be interested in helping re-org our website?  I'm currently 
negotiating to get us web hosting with an ejb provider.  If that goes 
through, I was thinking of possibly redoing the jos site using jetspeed 
(java.apache.org - look at the jetspeed project).  That would get us back 
to java programming even for the website.  And it may make it much easier 
to expand the site since anyone can propose and submit new "portlets" to 
extend the site without requiring major site changes or access to the 
internals of the site.

Obviously a wiki portlet, news portlet (slashdot-ish), and documentation 
portlet (similar to php.net's annotated manual) would be the place to 
start.  After that, official member list/directory portlet, package name 
reservation system, JSR system, working group management portlets, etc, etc.

If you're not interested because its too close to what you do at work 
that's totally understandable!

Al, you totally miss the point.
We are NOT looking for an ultimate ruler, but a president.
The job of the president will be to be coach, referee, scapegoat, janitor,
and scout for the next president.
Since JOS is a volunteer effort, the "RULING" is more an arbitrating and 
tie breaking and refereeing than dictating.

Regier, we won't blame you for the constitution that did not work,
if you stop mentioning it.

Let's try not to to handicap the revolution with mistakes of the past.
Once we get the truck unstuck and out of the mud, and get some
momentum again, then some effort could be diverted towards stuff like
researching which parts of the old constitution can be salvaged and
upgraded, and which parts should be quietly flushed.

For now though, please don't invalidate YOUR vote for the voting in progress
by attaching conditions to YOUR vote. You can only vote +1, 0, -1, not
+11/16th. It's all metric now ;-)

Helmut,

sigh.

Getting agreement on anything in this organization, even a voting procedure,
is a major accomplishment.  In my mind, what the informal vote is on is
simply whether it is worth taking a formal vote.  Why throw away an
established and binding voting procedure (which is all the Contstitution
really is) in favor of something else when the scope of this decision is
this big?  

Taking this vote as prescribed by the Constitution adds two important
properties:
*	It is binding.  Once the vote is taken and it is valid, it can't be
undone except by another vote.
*	People can't claim it is invalid, and therefore take away from the
power we are trying to give our interim President.  I don't want to
undermine the President's authority from the very start.

My vote is +1.  I just want us to do it the right way.

Regards,
Avery J. Regier

Just a warning her - unless you have had a lot of experience with Jetspeed
it can cost you a ***lot*** of time. It is not the most easiest thing to
setup and maintain. It would take a huuuge amount of time to setup and you
would have to assess if it is worth it - when the 60 hours spent instead on
a simpler website and JOS would do more benefit.

I am not saying don't use it - just think about it before you decide to. It
takes a lot of effort and knowledge to maintain so consider yourself warned
:P. 

Thou as an Apache guy and friends with Kevin (the guy who wrote it) I say
use it - if it is really what you want :P

Cheers,

Pete

Eww.  OK.  I'd actually like to use it especially because its an apache 
project and it looks like it has a lot of potential.  However, I'm short on 
time and speed is of the essence.  So maybe jetspeed should be a website 
2.0 thing and we should try something else... a custom portal based on 
enhydra perhaps.  Any suggestions for the quickest servlet based portal 
solution?

I'm mostly interested in a system that allows us to quickly and easily put 
up an ordered set of documentation with the concept of multiple "authors" 
and "editors".  This is similar to midgard but in java.

Hello,

For those of you who don't know, please see my vote proposal at VoteInfo in 
the jos wiki.  I need someone to second it (edit the page and put yourself 
in) and ping the list.  I'd also like to have someone volunteer to be the 
vote administrator who is not interested in being interim President (it 
would seem a little suspicious to have the vote admin be a candidate).  In 
any case, if we could get the ball rolling on this....  :)

Hi there,

Well, I have installed jetspeed and it runs fine, I have never used it 
before, so I guess I will look at the
samples that are included in the distribution.. but I agree that it looks 
powerful, and not too trivial to configure
the right way.
I'll just mess around with it, tie it to a MySQL database, and get back to 
you as soon as I have something
to show ;-) (If that's still what we want to do)

Even though I am more interested in being involved in JOS 'itself' in the 
long run, but one has to start
somewhere!

Sounds great.  Right now we haven't settled on anything so if you can get 
jetspeed working and ready to accept our custom portlets (which still need 
to be spec'd and built) then we'll probably pursue that.

No kidding.  Between admin and the website I haven't done any real coding

Hi all

After thinking about it I think we need to stop this vote.  I think
we're rushing it, we need to do this right.  We need to turn the project
around, but lets not do it too fast, people need time to adjust.

I don't think we need a president to change things, we just need someone
to help guides us in the right direction.  Think of how Iain and myself
have run the IRC meetings, we set an agenda, the discuss the topics, if
the discussion goes off-topic we try and bring it back on topic.  Almost
always the out come of the meeting has been good, with most of the
issues getting solved.

There is nothing in the responsibilities that needs the extraordinary
powers we want to grant (thought I don't think Iain would abuse them),
so lets not give them out.

Maybe JOS should be split in two,
"jos" (just organizational stuff) for one group to debate organizational 
and constitutional and political stuff for the next few hundred years,
and
"JOS"  (Java Operating System) to try to code a Java Operating System 
before Java is put on the same shelf as Pascal.

This is a smart-ass remark and NOT meant to take back my +1 vote for an 
immediate election of an Emergency Dictator or President to get JOS unstuck 
and moving.

Many academic organizations in Europe have a scheme of control that
could possibly assist us. Let me explain:


Council - 3 members - the Council is the "top" in the hierarchy, but is
only there to decide *general* policy, make public relations and (in the
case of funding) manage funds. They can agree or vote for decisions.

Senate - n members - the Senate is made up of JOS developers - they have
to be people who know about code and right code. These are the people
who, under the general guidelines of the council, take the technical and
implementation decisions for the project. They always vote for
decisions.

Court - everyone - everyone involved in project JOS that has the right
to access information regarding the development of JOS, propose ideas,
challenge proposals, comment, etc., but does not have the authoritative
power to change any decisions made by the Senate. People from the Court
can become members of the Senate in a way defined by us.


When we manage to define the aforementioned way, this scheme could work,
because we would have a "head" that guides the project on general, but
the actual decisions are made by the developers. The Council cannot
overrule a decision made by the Senate, but the Senate must work in
accordance to the general guidelines set by the Council.


Thoughts?

For org details, it says we do need authoritarian methods.  This is simply 
because, for some things like writing checks or answering questions during 
interviews, someone has to actually do it on behalf of jos without a vote 
and every member participating.  ;)

I agree that dictatorships leave a lot of room for oppression.  But the 
question has come up if we can tolerate the inefficiencies of a true 
democracy or do we risk a dictatorship (which is much more efficient).  The 
hope is always that you get a "benevolent dictatorship" but its at the risk 
that you get a bad one which, being more efficient, can do a lot more damage.

The original discussion on the general mailing list essentially boiled down 
to: "JOS, the organization, is broken and we should take some drastic 
measures to try and fix it.  The fix is an interim President."  (my 
interpretation)

Now, I'm getting the vibe that the mood is swinging back to: "JOS, the 
organization, is broken but we can fix it without taking drastic measures 
like an interim President." (my interpretation)

I'm just a quiet outside observer who once joined the JOS mailing list
because I am interested in java, and like the idea of a java operating
system. 

For what my humble opinion is worth, the organisational problems JOS
appears to be having do not appear to be unique. Perhaps it might be
useful to (re-) read the standard text on running an open source projects
by ESR called "The Cathedral and the Bazar" and perhaps also the follow-on
texts.

No, not the mood, just the expected few reactionaries who would prefer 
endless sandbox politics to real action. That in itself is a further 
indication why it takes a focused president who will keep the cart going 
forward and not stop to chat or go off course every time somebody hears a

I agree with the views of CntB.  And of course, jos as it was founded and 
as it stands violates most of its tenants for a successful open source 
project which is probably why we're having so much trouble:

<Quote 
href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/x285.html">

9. Necessary Preconditions for the Bazaar Style

It's fairly clear that one cannot code from the ground up in bazaar style 
[IN]. One can test, debug and improve in bazaar style, but it would be very 
hard to originate a project in bazaar mode. Linus didn't try it. I didn't 
either. Your nascent developer community needs to have something runnable 
and testable to
play with.

When you start community-building, what you need to be able to present is a 
plausible promise. Your program doesn't have to work particularly well. It 
can be crude, buggy, incomplete, and poorly documented. What it must not 
fail to do is (a) run, and (b) convince potential co-developers that it can 
be evolved into something really neat in the foreseeable future.

</Quote>

JOS began in bazaar mode and even worse in committee mode with the bazaar 
development model.  And the project didn't have anything that ran, and 
thus, doesn't show much potential for being something neat in the 
foreseeable future.  Not that it couldn't be neat in the future.  Just not 
in the _foreseeable_ future.  For reasons given in both CntB and 
Homesteading in the Noosphere 
(http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/) this 
approach is almost doomed to failure.  The lure of JOS is that the project 
itself meets with the CntB requirements for a great open source project, 
especially #1: Every good work of software starts by scratching a 
developer's personal itch.

Everyone working on/in/under/around java wants a JOS!

My current position is that jos, because of its start, is doomed to never 
get going.  Homesteading the Noosphere really makes it clear (if you accept 
his tenants) that JOS is going to have inherent problems the way we've 
structured it.  Readers should carefully read: 
http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/x349.html 
Section 16. Project Structures and Ownership.

Now I'm not saying that ESR is completely right and that I agree with 
everything he has to say but I think he does offer interesting things to 
think about.

As far as JOS goes, I think the way the project is organized needs to be 
rethought.  Sorta like a software "throw away" prototype.  Once you learn 
all you're going to learn from it, you throw it away and start fresh.  We 
tried it, we learned, now we need to do it all over from the ground up.

 From the way the current discussions are going, I have the feeling that 
many core members (as measured by activity both on the lists and in 
development) are not interested in throwing away the current jos 
organization structure.  This is an inherently dangerous situation as some 
"active" members do want to go through a restructuring and so its hard to 
make those that want to throw out the old rules follow the old rules.  ;)

Just look at my effort to go through an interim President vote.  Something 
that should obviously be an "extraordinary" vote but I'm only willing at 
the slowest to put through a "normal" vote.

So, at this point, its very important to establish how many people feel 
that we need to keep jos as is (or at least work legitimately following our 
constitution to make changes).

VOTE:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
So can I get an inpromptu vote:  How many people want to keep JOS as-is 
and/or feel that any changes must be made through the processes outlined in 
the constitution.  (+1 yes, +/-0 abstain, -1 no).

-1
Obviously
I think we need to do a full shakeup including tossing the constitution.  I 
voted in the constitution but now find it much too burdensome and the jos 
org structure poor for getting an open source jos built.

-iain

ps - If enough people do want to keep to the status quo I think that is 
perfectly understandable.  The rabble (including myself) that wants to 
throw away the old JOS and restart can just do that under a new name as a 
new project.  I'm sure we'll be able to collaborate (I don't see why it 
needs to be an unfriendly parting).

The mission of the AHCC 2000 consists of the following major objectives:

1) To draft a recommendation for an extraordinary change to the JOS
Constitution, Section 5, JOS Governance Procedures.
2) To review the recommendations with the JOS Membership in order to take
into account all issues brought forth.
3) To edit the recommendations with regards to the input received.
4) To advertise the recommendation under the extraordinary rules for a vote
by JOS Membership.
5) To further steward the recommendation through the JOS voting procedures.

Once these five major objectives have been me the AHCC 2000 will dissolve
with no further ado.

No qualifications for Section 5 membership have been determined at this time.

The contents of the recommendation that Section 5 is drafting would
include, but not be delimited to:

1) The institutionalization of a temporary Constitutional President (CP),
who would hold office six months out of the year.
2) The definition of the CP's roles, responsibilities, powers, constraints,
etc.
3) The institutionalization of a temporary Presidential Oversight Committee
(POC), which would balance and check the power and control of the
Constitutional President, but would operate year round.
4) The definition of the POC's roles, responsibilities, powers,
constraints, etc.
5) The rules and procedures by which the POC oversees the executive power
of the CP.

I do not offer the actual text of the Section 5 recommendation ... I think
this should be a group process, and recommend we continue further
discussions on Section 5 on general@jos.org. I encourage all members to
participate, and provide their valuable input in a timely manner. I
recommend Section 5 discussion end in a timely manner, and the matter drawn
up and advertised for a full vote.

For your convenience, some relevant sections of the JOS Constitution
concerning the extraordinary nature of this measure.

The first is decaf it should be documented on the JOS website and

The problem isn't with the current rules [1], it's with the lack of focus
and direction.  Now we don't need a president to to give us this focus,
this was the change of heart on my part.

What we need to do is treat this mailing list like a IRC meeting, we
need to set the agenda items, discuss them, and make decisions.  Any
decisions that are too important will need to be voted on and
constitution updated, etc.

The hard part will be to keep the discussion going and on-topic, but
thats not too hard when there are a number of people involved.

So here are my agenda items:
* Mailing list reorganization
* Web site reorganization
* Produce a status report
* How we develop code
* Chose a license for JOS
* Which organizational structure
* Setting up a non-profit entity
* Anything else I've left out

So add you agenda items.  I don't really mind the order we discuss
these in, but doing the easiest first would probably be the best.

Hi everybody

It has been discussed on the UI mailing list a little and it's been
something I want to discuss for a few week now.  We currently have
eleven mailing list and only three of them have been used frequently in
the last few months.

So the proposal is too reduce the number so that the discussions can be
more easily followed. 

So these would be the mailing lists:
announce -  Used to announce project status, releases, etc.
            Same as current mailing list.
vote-info - Used to organize votes as required by Policy Book.
            Same as current mailing list.
developer - Used to discuss all issuse related to developement.
            A combination of all the previous mailing lists.

I've left out the admin mailing list.  Do we need it?  Can we not just
use the developer mailing list?

I think we need a "general" or "user" list for anything that isn't 
development related.  Typically, because the developers are the voters, 
most projects seem to break it up as:

announce
dev
general/user

with votes occuring on the dev list.  I'd prefer to vote on a change to the 
policy book to get voting onto the dev list and break it up this way (3 
lists really is enough).

I disagree (that we don't need a much more focused group to provide new 
focus) but I'll play it out this way and see what happens if this is what 
poeple want.

>So here are my agenda items:
>* Mailing list reorganization

As covered in another article, I think we should change to the following:

jos-announce - low traffic (twice a month or once a week) Major 
announcements only
jos-dev - developers and voting occur here
jos-user - general discussions, user issues, etc

This requires changing the Policy book to point to the jos-dev list instead 
of the vote-info list.  I don't think this requires a vote.  It's 
administrative minutia.

We should make an announcement of the fact that a change has occured though 
on the announce list when that's in place.  I also recommend that we put 
all lists together (right now announce is still at spin isn't it?)  In 
addition, the archives from all old lists (and they're scattered all over 
the place) should be consolidated and put into an archive on our website.

Finally, since we're changing the list names, I also suggest hosting the 
lists on sourceforge.  One less piece of net infrastructure to maintain, 
fix, update, and backup.

>* Web site reorganization

I have just gotten the agreement from http://www.ejip.net/ to donate web 
hosting for us!  Servlets and ejb's and a jdbc database are now usable to 
build our website.  We just need to give them the word and we can have an 
account activated for us.

As soon as feasible, I'd really appreciate it if people could suggest 
approaches to take here.  Now that its java, I'm hoping to get more help 
with constructing the website... :)  Jetspeed and Enhydra is still my 
leading options but I'm willing to hear alternative suggestions for 
technology.  I'll be posting my outline of the new website (features, etc) 
later this week or early next week.

>* Produce a status report

This should probably be done once the change is in progress?  I was writing 
up one of the current state but there really wasn't much to put in it.

>* How we develop code
>* Chose a license for JOS
>* Which organizational structure

For these three, should we just put up a proposal and then let people tweak it?

>* Setting up a non-profit entity

I think this is a bit more overhead than we can handle right now.  Of 
course if someone has the time and inclination, we'd love to get this 
process started but I can't really start this now and I haven't heard 
anyone else volunteer to do this.  I propose putting this on the backburner 
until all the other major issues are taken care of.

Iain,

I have to disagree on this.  One of the properties of vote-info is that a
single person is only to be signed up once to this list.  It is this list
that enables us to have an accurate count of official 'membership'.  

A 'dev' list on the other hand, many people will want and need to be signed
up to more than once (like with both work and home email addresses) and this
wreaks havoc with vote counting.

Also, a change to the Policy Book for this would require an ordinary vote.
I don't think it is worth it.

Hmm.  I was trying to model it after the apache org which only has 
developers voting so everyone on dev (the developers) don't need an extra 
vote.  I can see letting everyone (users and general interest) vote with 
full vote privileges can be a big problem but it is how we're currently 
setup.  As far vote counting, jos is setup to do voting by directly 
emailing the vote admin.  The vote-info is only for vote announcements, and 
vote discussion.  I'm a bit unclear why we can't do vote announcements on 
announce, and vote discussion on general (if not dev).

>Also, a change to the Policy Book for this would require an ordinary vote.
>I don't think it is worth it.

I think its worth it.  I want to clean up the mailing list org and am 
willing to go through the pain.  IMHO, if voting is so difficult that doing 
things correctly is sacrificed simply to avoid voting, then voting should 
be made simpler/easier so we vote more often.  I personally think that 
ordinary voting is much too difficult and should be switched over to normal 
lazy voting ala apache's (+1, 0, -1 ping the list, get consensus).

Do we really need a user mailing list?  I don't think it is needed, at
least until we have made a alpha or beta release.  Simplest question to
ask yourself is, has there been any real discussions on a mailing list
which hasn't been development related, and if we do reach a stage that
there are to many user questions we can just start a new user mailing
list.

I think this is one of the problems with the way JOS is run. You choose to
undertake an action that will isolate members who can't attend. Why not
have discussions on the mailing lists instead ? This way it is archived
better and allows more people to participate. 


Cheers,

Pete

Yes, the votes take place by directly emailing the vote admin.  However, the
total number or 'registered' voters is taken from the roll of the vote-info
list.  This number of registered voters is the basis for finding out if a
vote passed.  This is why it is important that a single person be on the
vote-info not more than once.

	I think its worth it.  I want to clean up the mailing list org and
am 
	willing to go through the pain.  IMHO, if voting is so difficult
that doing 
	things correctly is sacrificed simply to avoid voting, then voting
should 
	be made simpler/easier so we vote more often.  I personally think
that 
	ordinary voting is much too difficult and should be switched over to
normal 
	lazy voting ala apache's (+1, 0, -1 ping the list, get consensus).

I don't think it is worth going through the pain because:
1) I don't believe such a reorganization of the voting procedure is in our
best interest.  In your scenario, in order for us to count votes correctly
(according to the constitution), I could only be subscribed to the 'dev'
list once.  That is very inconvenient for me and I'm sure for many others.
The voting designed in the Constitution is for making votes binding and
official.  The 'dev' list doesn't accomplish that.
2) If all you want to do is find a consensus of active developers, without
making a vote binding or official, then you can use the +1 type vote on the
'dev' list for that without going through an official Constitutional vote.
The Constitution doesn't prevent that.

Correct.  But as far as making that a membership quality it seems pretty 
lame.  I can see people wanting to be members that don't want to be on the 
list and the other way around.  I think membership should be a web 
database.  Part of the new site.  So you fill out a form, and you are 
entered as member.  Another removes you from being a member.

As my above comment states.  I think mailing lists and membership need to 
be separate things for exactly this reason amongst others.

So that means developers will need to be politicians and that once JOS has 
enough members (people interested in it by say using it) you'll never be 
able to make a decision.  Say developers want to rewrite the kernel in 
cobol.  They'd have to have everyone (or the majority in any case) that's a 
JOS member approve.  This starts to look unwieldy if we had a membership 
the size of say Java Lobby...

My personal opinion is that mailing list discussions tend to take too long 
and go off on threads too easily.  The chat meetings usually are nice in 
that they get decisions made much quicker.  I do sympathize with your 
position though.  Perhaps it would be best to do these things over the 
mailing list if we can figure out a way to make it move quicker.  Any 
suggestions?

ps - I think it will go faster if we use the simple developer voting scheme 
I've been pushing.  I've seen small and large decisions made quickly on 
lists that use that technique.

Hi Peter

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you on this.

Sure, an IRC meeting is not the best way to involve most of the JOS
membership, but it is a really good way to cover a number of topics in a
short space of time.  I'm currently trying to have some more discussions
on the mailing list.
