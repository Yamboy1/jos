I have a feeling that it will be difficult to logically decide what's in 
and what's out.  How about the following suggestion instead: We 
start with one big project which is everything in existing JOS CVS 
and the pre-existing mailing lists.  Everyone that's willing to work 
with the core kernel developers to check in files remains in the core 
JOS project as far as SourceForge goes (I think if we keep the core 
developer list to 5-10 (which I think its at now) it should work out 
fine).  

When someone wants to work on a related project but wants their 
own CVS access, they can break away from the core project, form 
a new SourceForge project (for CVS and bug list usage), and we'll 
integrate them into the JOS project through our website and wiki 
(they point their source forge web page to the jos web page).  That 
way, the core project will stay focused, and new projects can grow 
&quot;organically&quot; without waiting for architectural decisions to be made.

&gt;<i> Ok.  So anybody who would like to discusse a licence for the JOS Project
</I>&gt;<i> should subscribe to the <A HREF="mailto:biz@jos.org">biz@jos.org</A> mailing list, and start work on it.
</I>
I've started another thread for this discussion.
