<PRE>Hi Iain

&gt;<i> How much time do you think is reasonable?  
</I>
I was thinking until we have the project structure worked out, ie, do
we have lots of smaller SourceForge projects, or one big one.

&gt;<i> I was actually thinking of making the move gradually.  First set up 
</I>&gt;<i> the jos project account at SourceForge and turning on the features 
</I>&gt;<i> we don't have. Make an announcement, links on the web pages 
</I>&gt;<i> and let that settle in.  Then moving CVS to SourceForge.  Then 
</I>&gt;<i> moving mailing lists to SourceForge.  Should it all be done at once?
</I>
I don't mind, which ever is the easiest in the long run.  I'm not sure
what has to be moved, cvs, wiki web, mailing lists.  Of these I think the
wiki web would be the hardest to move over.

&gt;<i> I agree.  Although, the entire discussion of a JOS source license 
</I>&gt;<i> was postponed to avoid distracting the core developers from getting 
</I>&gt;<i> the first kernel out.  Is now the time to bring this up (and probably 
</I>&gt;<i> slow down development while the issue is discussed)?  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think we might as well just get it over with (no time like the 
</I>&gt;<i> present).  Especially now that we have a voting mechanism in 
</I>&gt;<i> place for major project decisions.
</I>
Ok.  So anybody who would like to discusse a licence for the JOS Project
should subscribe to the <A HREF="mailto:biz@jos.org">biz@jos.org</A> mailing list, and start work on it.
