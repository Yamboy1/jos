<PRE>Hi everybody

I've been very quite on the mailing lists and wiki lately, but i'm going
to try and changed that. :)

So far I don't have any problem with moving over to SourceForge, but I
think we should give it a little more time, just to make sure it's right.

&gt;<i> I agree that we definitely want to allow Windows users to 
</I>&gt;<i> participate.  I do believe that the sourceforge structure is designed 
</I>&gt;<i> to try and keep projects as small and focused as possible.  For 
</I>&gt;<i> example, there is only one list of developers per project.  You 
</I>&gt;<i> either have commit access to the cvs tree or you don't.  We don't 
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily want the people working on a driver to have commit 
</I>&gt;<i> access to the kernel right?  So, it would seem logical that each 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;product&quot; (which comes down to source that a single &quot;cvs commit 
</I>&gt;<i> group&quot; should have access too) should be broken up into a 
</I>&gt;<i> separate sourceforge project.  We'll then tie all the separate 
</I>&gt;<i> sourceforge projects into the overall jos project through our website 
</I>&gt;<i> and the wiki.
</I>
I don't like the idea of setting up lot's of separate sourceforge
projects for the core parts of JOS (kernel, jvm, drivers, class
libraries, etc), I don't mind so much for applications thought.

Anyway I wouldn't imagine there being a big problem adding the access list
functionality, we are currently using with cvs to the sourceforge cvs.

Another thing I noticed in the site FAQ was this.

   Who can host with SourceForge?
   We're trying to keep it simple, and chose to rely on the work of a very
   talented group, the Open Source Initiative.  If your software utilizes
   one of the OSI's approved licenses, we'd love to offer you hosting at
   SourceForge.  Software that falls under other licenses will require
   further scrutiny, but is not altogether ruled out.  In the end, we're
   looking to further Open Source software development, and will approve
   projects accordingly.

We currently don't have a project wide license, I think this is something
we should work on before moving over.
