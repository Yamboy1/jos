<PRE>All,

I want to remind everyone that the upcoming vote on our proposed
Constitution is less than a month away!  Remember that in order for you to
be an eligable voter you must subscribe to the <A HREF="mailto:vote-info@jos.org">vote-info@jos.org</A> mail list.
So far only 29 people have registered to vote.  I have found it interesting
that some of our most active developers have not found the time to register
themselves to vote.  

You can register to vote at <A HREF="http://jos.org/mailman/listinfo/vote-info">http://jos.org/mailman/listinfo/vote-info</A>
Links to the proposed Constitution and PolicyBook are on the wiki at:
<A HREF="http://jos.org/wiki/view/main/Constitution">http://jos.org/wiki/view/main/Constitution</A>  Please go there and look it
over.  There were a few misconceptions about it at the IRC meeting, and it
would do everyone good to read and understand it and its immediate purpose.
Please also look at the FAQ that we have put together which should answer
most of your questions about the proposal.  If you have any further
concerns, please sign up to the <A HREF="mailto:biz@jos.org">biz@jos.org</A> mail list and discuss them!

In order for the vote to take place, I need a volunteer to be a neutral vote
administrator as defined by section 4.3 of the proposed Constitution.  For
this vote, the vote administrator needs to be willing and able to do the
following things:
*  Join the <A HREF="mailto:biz@jos.org">biz@jos.org</A> mailing list where voting issues will be discussed.
*  Take votes via email for 20 days.
*  Tabulate the votes in the manner prescribed by the Constitution and
advertise the results of the vote within three days of the end of voting.
*  Be willing to be scrutinized as to whether or not you are neutral in this
vote.

Also, I suggest that the administrator for this vote be someone who:
*  Has not been greatly involved in the defining and wording of the
Constitution.  This rules out myself, Matt Caswell, and Scott Miller.
*  Someone who has been involved in the project for at least a year.

Thanks!
Avery J. Regier
