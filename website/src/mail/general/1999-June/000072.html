My implementation of a registry has nothing to do with the JOS system's
behaviour overall. That is, I am not supplying an
installation/deinstallation API with the registry, I am just making a
distributed (RMI), OO registry, that looks a lot like an inverted tree
file system, and can do things like move, replace, merge, retain, link,
update from remote, etc..

The registry is under org.jos.registry (I also made a Wiki page!) and
can be used by any application. If the JOS system decides to use a
central registry (instead of a temp directory), then applications
written for JOS will probably be able to write to a global registry. The
good thing with the registry is that it runs as a server, and it also
has replication capabilities (working on them now), which means that it
assists in the development of a truly distributed JOS system.

I've also included a lot of functionality in the addressing mechanism of
the registry. That is, to access an entry, you do something like this:

Address address = new Address(&quot;//dir/dir/dir/entry&quot;);

This address object though could have a URI pointing to a specific RMI
registry on any system, so functions like:

registry.copy(local_address, remote_address)

would have the registry copy entries from a registry in any part of the
world...

I will also start working on the security of the registry, which will
work in a way similar to Java's security overall - that is, a CodeBase
object is the group, a Class is the user, etc.
