<PRE>Greetings,


Although I have posted about the registry before, and nobody replied or
looked at the source code, I am posting again, because I made several
big changes (new features). Maybe this time a few people will look into
it...

The registry is an inverted tree, which uses binary search for
insertion, addition and deletion. It supports unlimited number of
entries (leafs) and directories (nodes), utilizing the LinkedList class
(which I wrote for JOS a year ago).

I implemented merging support, and made it implementation neutral. That
is, no matter how the interfaces and abstract classes for the registry
are implemented, the merging can occur between different implementations
of the registry API.

Finally, I made it RMI. There is a new class, called RegistryServer that
starts an RMI server for the registry. I have tested it and it seems to
work find (and fast). Since this is my first serious RMI application, I
would appreciate if any RMI gurus out there could test it and comment.

I have not posted it on the CVS or the source server because I have not
written the license for JOS in the files yet. You can find a copy of the
source code, the binaries and the skel/stubs at the following URL:

[http://www.outworld.org/temp/working/jos/Registry.jar]
Just unjar it.

Thanks in advance, everyone!
