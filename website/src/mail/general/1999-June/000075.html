Not a problem really, just a concern... JOS appears to have so many
members, and it is true that many work behind the scenes (I myself, for
instance), but there are so many people in the members lists who have
not yet posted a single thing on the lists, the wiki, the CVS or the
source server.

Maybe, by asking for help, we should make it clear that we really have
little code, and that we want people with extensive knowledge to help us
build the *basis* of JOS, its foundations. We need people the know not
only how to make a kernel and a JVM, but also integrate everything
together.

I think this point should be stressed out, just that.
