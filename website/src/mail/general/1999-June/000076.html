<PRE>Hello everybody

I'm currently working on writing the Kernel Interface, which is a 
platform independent interface/api between the kernel and the rest of 
the system.

Now the problem i'm having is that i've had very little feedback on 
what i'm doing.  This could be because i'm going in the right 
direction, or i'm going in the completely wrong direction (and nobody 
wants to tell me).  Also even thought English is my first language, 
writing in it's one of my talents (for example this email has taken 
me more then an hour to write so far).  So this means i'm spending a 
lot more time writing, which would be better spent programing, which 
i'm better at.

So what I need is a group of people who can help by giving me 
feedback or by writing some parts of the documentation for or with 
me.  You don't need to be a kernel expert (i'm not) to help, it's 
just common sense.

So any volunteers?
