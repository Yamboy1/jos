Games are definitely something we'll need for JOS.  However, 
unless you think you'll need os specific calls, you should be able 
to code your game using straight java, and it will work on JOS.  So 
you can use Java3D on another platform, program your game now, 
and when JOS gets to that stage, you can be one of the first 
games on JOS!
