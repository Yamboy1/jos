<PRE>&gt;<i> Sean,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am already familiar with Swing and its design. I was thinking of something 
</I>&gt;<i> skin based (like NeoPlanet and WinAmp) and cool looking like the Mac OS X 
</I>&gt;<i> Aqua interface or Stardock's Object Desktop for Windows 2000.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I could start working on a design.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does this plaf need to be based on Swing? The one thing I don't like about 
</I>&gt;<i> Swing is its deep object hierarchy (for backward compatibility) and its poor 
</I>&gt;<i> performance (which supposedly has been improved in JDK 1.3). I was more 
</I>&gt;<i> impressed by the design of IFC. Simple, clean, and fast.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>

That's excellent.  In fact, there had been discussion of making the PLAF a
lower-level function, i.e. plugging them into the AWT-peer level.  This
will allow users to pick the look of their favorite L&amp;F in all apps, not
just Swing ones.  Ryan Heise had created something called SwingToolkit
that used Swing components to replace AWT peers (but ultimately it relied
on native Component peers and bridged the native toolkit).  I dabbled in
something like that myself, but found it too resource intensive.  If we
can develop an interface for L&amp;F's at the peer level, we can allow anyone
with any graphics hardware and applications to use the L&amp;F's.
&quot;Skinnability&quot; (technical term :) is an ultimate goal of mine too.

I personally haven't seen the IFC design, but anything would be more
lightweight than Swing :).  Ultimately, for compatibility reasons, we
should port our new L&amp;F to Swing -- this also allows non-JOS users to try
out our L&amp;F.

Sean
