Principles and Practice, 2nd ed/ (J.D. Foley) has very detailed information

Abrash's /Zen of Graphics Programming/ is a great source for optimized
graphics on the x86 platform (it is also in his compilation work /Graphics
Programming Black Book/).  I wrote a graphics library in C a long while
back, but it was for VESA SVGA modes using 256 colors.  It's technique was
to have an in-memory buffer which was later copied to the screen.  I can
e-mail it to you if you want to see how the basic algorithms worked.

I think it would help us in the long run to follow the Java2D architecture
for the underlying graphics.  Of course, we would only need to support the
functionality that JDK 1.1 supports initially.  This would cut down on a
lot of code overhead, and graphics techniques that are a bit of a headache.

Jeff Trent: And every word of it's true, too.
Colonel Edwards: That's the fantastic part of it.
