&gt;<i> Another good reason to build on Java2D is its support of the Graphic Driver
</I>&gt;<i> classes.  It has already established a class model for graphics drivers and
</I>&gt;<i> multiple display modes.  I did a tad bit of work on this when decaf was in
</I>&gt;<i> its infancy (before case statements were supported!).  This is a good
</I>&gt;<i> starting point.  We may not need to support *everything* Java2D has to
</I>&gt;<i> start with, though.  Alpha colors in 16-bit VGA mode are a little
</I>&gt;<i> rediculous :-)
</I>
Does Java2D have primitives implemented?  What I mean is, given a
primitive graphics command, can it produce a raster format?  This would be
a great help in implementing the Graphics class.  For now, I'd like to
keep everything 1.1-compliant, and the footprint small, so if Java2D is
big, we may have to leave it out.  Once our VM &amp; class library are
approaching 1.2 compliancy, we could fully integrate it.  If Java2D
doesn't provide the vector-to-raster translation though, I may be looking
for someone who is geometrically/graphically inclined to help implement
primitives.

Here's my current plan for the VGA AWT:
1) Make a bare-bones implementation of the toolkit and a simple peer
(Canvas or the like) and graphics contexts. Draw some random primitives on
the screen.
2) Implement off-screen images.(a lot bigger task than it sounds) Draw
onto an image, then blit it on the screen.

Others to follow (in no particular order):
* Implement some raster fonts, draw onto a component.
* Implement other simple components, e.g. Button.
* Implement windows (frames, dialogs, etc).
* Implement the rest of the AWT!!

Anyone who is interested please feel free to help.  At this point, I'm not
too picky about clean implementation, as long as it's readable and
understandable.  However, efficiency is a must - we know the VGA driver is
slow, so we have to keep our code to a minimum.
