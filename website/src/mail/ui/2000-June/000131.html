<PRE>&gt;<i> Making the plaf a lower level function is an interesting idea but 
</I>&gt;<i> how would 
</I>&gt;<i> that affect all applications? If an application is built on Swing, for 
</I>&gt;<i> instance, how would any intervention at the AWT peer level change 
</I>&gt;<i> the look 
</I>&gt;<i> of the Swing components, since Swing uses peers as a resource for
</I>drawing 
&gt;<i> and some events? I do believe this kind of intervention would 
</I>&gt;<i> affect all AWT 
</I>&gt;<i> based applications.
</I>
The intervention at the AWT Peer level would only affect Swing in ways
that AWT does on a normal system, i.e. Window and Frame would be affected.
However, as I said in my previous message, we could design our L&amp;F so that
it is easily ported to (or from) Swing, in which case we could make Swing
apps look the similar to AWT-based ones and vice versa.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do have many other questions but I need to nail down my 
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts first. I 
</I>&gt;<i> have written this email over and over. I will need to write you later.
</I>
Keep them coming!  It's been a long time since anyone has really discussed
UI on the JOS project.
