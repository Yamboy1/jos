Iain Shigeoka has a good plan to reduce the number of active JOS-related
mailing lists down to just four.  The UI mailing list has been inactive; it
might be better served by the apps@jos.org list or kernel@jos.org list.

I'd like to hear peoples thoughts before anything is seriously considered.

Cheers,
DigiGod

	I'm not opposed.  When UI becomes a high-traffic topic (again), we
can form a new list for it, if necessary.

Sounds like a good idea; althought apps@jos.org would probably fit the
category better than kernel@jos.org, IMO.

+1

Obviously I'm on the bandwagon for this.

Hi All

I want to write a CLI for an SNMP manager. Can any body suggest me how
to start? Can anybody suggest if there are any tutorials/books
available?

Thanks in advance

There should be nothing special about a CLI for any program.  Simply read 
the args in the main function for your startup class.  Most introduction to 
programming java books will begin with programs that use CLI so any 
beginners tutorial and any "learning java" book should be sufficient to learn.
