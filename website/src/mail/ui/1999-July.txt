Hi,

I'm a regular visitor to the JOS web page.  I have interests in GUI and
networking and kernel issues.  I noticed you were a regular commenter on
GUI issues and I didn't want to bother registering yet so I thought I
might send you an email.

After noticing some of your comments in the Traditional GUI group,
specifically under the Task Widget section, an epiphany came to me.  The
real challenge of creating a standard graphical user interface for JOS
will be porting the java.awt.peer package to the platform.  In some of
the other discussions, people commented on what they liked and didn't
like from other operating systems.  The whole idea of Swing's pluggable
look & feel architecture is to allow users to customize their
environment to suit them.  I propose that it may be possible to map the
required AWT "peers" into the Swing package, creating the ability to
completely customize even standard AWT components.  The implementation
of the peers would only require a Component peer and maybe a Container
and Lightweight peer.  All the other peers could be mapped to
lightweight components in the Swing package.  This would save a lot of
brain-racking native implementation.  But wait, you say, what about the
heavyweight components in Swing? How would you create a frame (AWT Frame
or JFrame or otherwise)?  The FramePeer could be mapped to
JInternalFrame, allowing them to be customizable as well.  Then the only
thing required is a customized JDesktopPane as the root container in the
GUI, under which all windows could be opened.  Additionally, a
lightweight component could be created to mimic the behavior of the
WindowPeer.  After all this is complete, the user could replace the
entire L&F of his GUI just by specifying the L&F class.  Pretty cool,
huh?

Anyway, that's my idea.  Please comment/criticize/etc, and post to the
JOS server or appropriate mailing list if you can.  Thanks.

I've spent some time inside it, yes. (mostly trying to figure out why what I was trying to wasn't working, obscenities may have been involved) And after I fwd'ed that message to the mailing list I
thought of another idea that may be more feasible: creating AWT peers that use the componentUI classes directly, replacing the M instead of the VC for once; what I know of Swing and AWT make this seem
like a good idea, but I've been wrong before.

UI readers,

I am starting a project that will create pluggable look-and-feels for
JOS.  I would like people to help out as much as possible.  I have
created a Wiki page called OrgJosPlaf and proposed a package:
org.jos.plaf (see the similarity :) Please send me an email or direct
your discussion at the OrgJosPlaf wiki page.  Thanks.

Subject: [JOS-UI] New project

Malini -

I just recently joined JOS, although I had followed it for a while
before joining.

I guess the first thing to do is set some goals for the project, so
here's my ideas:

The overall goal is to create a Pluggable Look and Feel for JOS.  This
is basically a 
set of Java classes that define the appearance and behavior of
Swing-style GUI widgets.

Subgoals:
1) The PL&F should be configurable using themes, i.e. color themes,
sound themes,
   behavior themes, whatever we can come up with.  We might also provide
some mini-
   applications that allow the user to configure these themes.

2) Make the appearance and behavior distinctively JOS, but incorporate
behaviors from 
   other UIs that we like and disclude "features" that we dislike.  For
example, I 
   like the appearance of a Windows-style GUI, but I would rather it
work like Motif
   (although the CDE is horridly ugly).

In addition to creating a JOS L&F, we might also create some emulations
of other UIs, but I've been told we will have to be careful of copyright
infringement.  It might be good to have someone responsible for
investigating this issue.

For an example of PL&F, look in the Java 1.2 API spec under the
javax.swing.plaf.* packages (the default
look and feel is in the javax.swing.plaf.metal package).  Also read some
of the pages at 
the Swing Connection: http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/,
specifically the PLAF papers and a link
I have put on the OrgJosPlaf page.

As far as development requirements, you have all you need, although I
would recommend a good development environment. Hope this helps.

The page is pretty much standalone.  I guess the project should be part
of the TraditionalGUIGroup,
but I'm not sure how it would fit in yet, as I don't administer that
group.  There's also no special
mailing list as of yet.  Does that answer your questions?

Please explain, I'm not familiar with LFBC.  I suppose you're referring
to a basic windowing system,
but it shouldn't be hard to design one ourselves.  Besides, if we are
able to create peers that map into
Swing, then we won't have to worry to much about low-level windowing
issues.

It would probably fit in the periphery since it has absolutley nothing to do anything with the other projects but kinda something to do with it. And this is the mailing list for it, projects dont get
their own lists as of yet.

That would be part of JADE (see Wiki: JADE)

Be careful about this, creating a L&F and peer/UI mapping are two seperate things a different project might be less confusing and add some order allowing these two goals to be reached more rapidly.

You're right.  The AWT peers definitely belong in a different project. 
I was just speaking in general about the (hopefully) design of the GUI. 
L&F's are a simpler and completely JOS-independent project.

One advantage of having the L&F's designed before JOS debuts is that we
can produce pre-release screenshots without having to run the actual
OS.  Someone can simply create a program that mimics the proposed UI,
use the JOS L&F in the program, and produce a screenshot.

I have changed the OrgJosPlaf page over the course of today.  Check it
out.

the entire concept of the UI for JOS is, but I know what you mean.

Im going to look into the peer-UI mappings tonight actually, tell you all what I find out.

Also instead of Apps, the plaf configurers make small JavaBeans (like JColorChooser) that can be run as apps so its easy to embed them in other apps, and I keep telling myself Im going to do that (but
will see).

Subject: [JOS-UI] peer-ui mappings

On the UI mailing list SeanCribbs brought up the idea of mapping Swing to AWT peers. the peers wouldn't point to JComponents but the ComponentUI's that draw them. this idea has complications:

After some research I am going to declare it feasible, of course its not simple (why cant it ever be simple?) its only one facet of making JOS graphic-able. Of course we must do it, and we might as
well do it right.

I want every UI and graphics person interested to do some reasearch and get together, on the UI list, to discuss what needs to be done and how to do it.

The keystone in all of this is the java.awt.Toolkit class, its easily replacable, but we need to do it carefuly and its going to have to tie into so many other things, the peer-ui maps being but a
tiny facet of that. Stuff like graphics and printing and clipboards and more are all there too.

I think to do this right we need to define some classes like Screen (the monitor or LCD where everythings shown) and JOSWindow that arent really part of the AWT or Swing and would only be used
internally (or by people who like to show off) one of the cool things about this is we can make the titlebar on frame swappable with the rest of the UI (on non-JOS computers and non-JOS L&F's it would
be ignored) and of course we could just pass Screen's graphics2D to the screensavers (which would mean you could do anything with a JOSsaver as any other screensaver in anyother OS).

Well Im starting to ramble, always a good sign that I should stop writing. viva la org.jos.ui.JOSToolkit!

I just downloaded it and am going to take a look at it, although from the readme on your website I can tell we're going to have to do somethings differently.

the jos package is for things that require native code and the like, so lets put it in org.jos.ui.core[.peers?]

Subject: [JOS-UI] Smart Factory: Components

I wonder. Isn't possible to create a smart factory (see SmartAPIPages) for
AWT components, AWT peers, and Swing components. Why do we want to use a
toolkit without a smart factory? The "toolkit" does not use separate
controllers for each component, so your stuck with a factory, not a smart
factory.

Imagine that the toolkit _uses_ a smart factory. The smart factory is
configured with controllers for _all_ of the AWT and Swing components on
your computer. Not just components that come with standard Java. I mean
_all_ of your components.

If we had a smart factory for components--all components--we would be able
to mix and match the peers behind AWT and Swing. I'm thinking that a smart
factory for components would use the JOS Registry API (see RegistryAPI) to
configure the list of component controllers.

This extends the idea of look and feel, I think. When you combine a
powerful smart factory to the GUI, you can get a button without knowing the
name of a specific button class. A smart factory should be able to create a
button with a caption, an image, a caption and image, in both AWT _and_
Swing. A smart factory should be able to creaet a sticky button in both AWT
_and_ Swing.

What else? A smart factory can support Java 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 (1.2) and the
next version of Java, too. We can look forward to being the first operating
system to support Java 3.

I don't know if you can apply a smart factory to /everything/ it has its place in many things but I think this area is to abstract for it and would just make it harder to make good UI's (its way to
easy to create bad ones already)

There are a few behind the scenes places it could be used in the lower level stuff Id imagine, and if their is it will be used. design is about picking the best pattern for the job, not your favorite
(my favorite happens to be the "you do it, I'll watch" pattern :)

exactly, although I think window is the only one that should have to talk to the graphics device directly, the way AWT/Swing draws that would be the only thing nessecary. also, and Ive said it before,
we should have swappable titlebars (that is a Swing FrameComponentUI) in our quasicomponent/peer for the frame class (since not all plafs would support this we should have it change to the default
(that is JOS) L&F's titlebar so you dont have something like a window titlebar on a mac window (because you know they'd just get into a fight)).

But maybe the window quasicomponent/peer shouldnt talk directly to the graphics device but instead to a handy abstraction called Screen, this would encaps. the Screen (duh), provide stuff like the
colorModel and screensize to the toolkit. it could handle stuff like window drawing (all that boring redraw crap no one wants to do) via a "default" child (DesktopScreen?). And as I said before the
screensaver would be passed this directly so it could play with the desktop.

Another point of buisness, all this stuff is lowlevel JADE (if you dont know what Im talking about see JADE on the Wiki) and JADE, being the UI, isnt really part of the OS so should it be in org.jos?
I dont think so, org.jade would be more appropriate since it is a JOS-only app and it would be a pretty big, no point getting it all mixed up with JOS (its easier for everyone this way)

JADE will probably interface directly to org.jos.core.*, does that mean
it /has/ to be in org.jos.ui.jade.*? 
I wrote a program that used javax.swing.*, does that mean I have to put
it in javax.swing.myapp.*? JADE will be an integral part of JOS'es
succes, but I think the ability for it to be /not/ part of JOS is just
as important. it is an application, an ambassador between the human the
computer, one that can change shape to best communicate. if JOS were
running off the onboard of a small robot in someones basement it wouldnt
need JADE, JADE would be a hinderance, adding extra weight to its
fragile alluminum legs. this same robot might have a remote connection
to jon q. hackers PC, which does have JADE and a small app for sending
data to the robot, that would be the best way to communicate in this
case. Thats why we want JADE to be flexible, so we can have the best way
to communicate with JOS at all times, part of realizing that is
realizing sometimes the best way is without JADE.

I'll take the opportunity here to disagree.  JADE should go directly into
the org.jos.ui.jade.* tree.  It should not go into its own org.jade package
because it is going to be directly interfacing with org.jos.core.* for such
things as the registry and for starting new processes, etc.  JADE will be as
much an integral part of JOS as anything else is.

Hi,

    As what u said, I think once u want to write any UI Interface that

just my 2c:
JADE will be developed and maintained by the JOS-Project. Therefore
the classes should be located somewhere in the org.jos tree and the
appropiate subtree for it is ui.

Then there should be a subsection for all plafs that will be
implemented.

So I'd like to create the packages as follows:

org.jos.ui.plaf          - everything that has to implemented for all
l&fs 
                           (If there is something needed outside the 
                           java.swing and java.swing.plaf packages)
org.jos.ui.plaf.default  - a default JOS l&f 

org.jos.ui.jade          - like the p&f a package containing
everything for all UI-Managers
org.jos.ui.jade.default  - the default Application handler.

The used jade-package should always use the UI which is set as the
"System Look and Feel", this should be just an entry in the registry,
so it's easy to change. (Of course the jade-manager should be set in
the same manner)

With this, it's quite easy for everybody outside JOS to write and
install their own jades using some methods like
(JadeManager.installJade(packageName) ) and the JOS-System has some
default-values it can rely on...

Just some thoughts about it...

Its not a system look&feel, its a UI. JADE is a neutral platform upon
which UI's are placed, it can also simultaneosly be thought of as a
toolkit for making them. The default would be TGUI and/or CLI so there
would be extra support for these two.

its not writing and installing your own JADE's it's writing and
installing your own UI's; JADE is an application, a socket in which UI's
are plugged into.

Ok, I was thinking of a default l&f to be used by a TGUI so you can change
the l&f independently from the GUI. Maybe that wasn't clear.

Hmm. As a newbie to JOS some questions now stirr up, which I wasn't able to
solve by reading the WIKI-Pages. (Maybe I just haven't found them)
What are the proposals of this socket? The whole System-IO things will be
done in jos.ui and org.jos.io and the API is already done in the
java-classes so you should be able to write an ui with that or did I miss
something obvious?

Thanks for answering these ones.

Thomas.

If by that you mean we have an API hammered out AND written AND compiled
AND tested. um, no. it seems everybodys waiting for something else,
something else thats waiting for something else also, generally. If you

I meant the java-api. (I think I'll have to reread my mail more properly
bevore sending ;-) )
It has everything you need to make a UI (except the specialities of a
TextScreen or a Screen-Object which should be located somewhere in the
jos.ui - things in native code...
My Question is just, what JADE will provide and if it needs some native-code.

Thomas.

JADE is a JOS-only App that will require no native code of its own
(although it will reference some a few degrees away in the graphics
devices and such). It will be a scaffolding that other programmers place
their objects on to make a UI; it doesnt care what the UI is. its job is
to let the user talk to JOS via an abstraction. It should provide a
super-generic base for building anytype of UI (XUI's) and some libraries
and frameworks for building the more common CLI's and TGUI's (via
JFC/swing) (see:
http://www.jos.org/wiki/view/main/UserInterfaceDefinitions, for more
exact definitions)

Subject: [JOS-UI] peer-ui mappings

UI'ers:

I've reached an intermediate completion point.  All of the peers and the
toolkit compile, however, there are runtime errors.  In digging through
Sun's source, I have realized the java.awt.Toolkit class maintains a
pointer to the first initialized toolkit.  Therefore, any changes to the
awt.toolkit property are ignored after the first toolkit is created. 
(@#$%&^*&^!!!!) If you run the JOSTKtest class I have included, you can
see everything fine.  However, if you specify the awt.toolkit property
to be org.jos.ui.core.JOSToolkit on the command line, it doesn't work. 
I would like some help with this if anyone has time.  Additionally, some
of the peers won't pass back all the appropriate events.  I believe List
and Scrollbar are a few. The Component and Container peers are still
skeletons, until I can get a well-defined interface with graphics
hardware (most likely using JADE). I suppose posting attachments on this
list is not desirable, so I will put a jar file at:

http://www.ens.utulsa.edu/~scribbs/jostkpeers.jar

It will contain all of the compiled classes in their proper directories,
plus the source in a src/ directory.  The main class of the jar will be
JOSTKtest, so you can just run "java -jar jostkpeers.jar" if you want.

Sean,

I tried running your code, and it comes up, but doesn't ever seem to call
any Swing widgets.  Could you put some out.println's in the Toolkit so that
we at least know when it is working?

What JDK are you using?
platform?

On the issues with initializing to the proper toolkit, I think Ryan Heise
has solved some of those problems.  See:

How does this "Screen" abstraction differ from Java2D's
GraphicsConfiguration, GraphicsDevice, and GraphicsEnvironment classes?  It
seems to me that these contain all the information/fuctionality needed for a
Screen.  We just need a way to have the Toolkit use our current
GraphicsDevice instance for the given system's hardware.

I haven't looked too deeply into this, but I think this may be a good place
to start.

Well in JOS it wont matter since it will be the default toolkit for one
thing.

also Id like to say this is part of JADE, and should be in something
like org.jos.experimental.seancribbs.ui.jade.awt.JOSToolkit.

cant component, container, frame and all that just be lightweight and
have all the graphics stuff in Window?(since thats where it all comes
from) and that just use the Screen (or whatever).

well I dont know anything about Graphics2D yet (other then that its 2D)
but the screen abstract class would be a container for the frames and
toolbars and all that other desktop stuff (probably via a subclass,
DesktopScreen) maybe it would use those classes though. we should look
into it.

As far as I can tell the Screen I proposed does more then the Java2D
stuff and some differnent things AND as far as I can tell there's no
reason why it wouldnt use them

Subject: [JOS-UI] Graphics2D &Screen

excerpt from
http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/2d/spec/j2d-bookTOC.doc.html

     The Java 2D API defines three levels of configuration information
that are maintained to support the conversion from
     user space to device space. This information is encapsulated by
three classes:

          GraphicsEnvironment 
          GraphicsDevice 
          GraphicsConfiguration 

     The GraphicsEnvironment describes the collection of rendering
devices visible to a Java application on a
     particular platform. Rendering devices include screens, printers,
and image buffers. The GraphicsEnvironment
     also includes a lis t of all of the available fonts on the
platform. 

     A GraphicsDevice describes an application-visible rendering device,
such as a screen or printer. Each possible
     configuration of the device is represented by a
GraphicsConfiguration. For example, an SVGA display device
     can operate in several modes: 640x480x16 colors, 640x480x256
colors, and 800x600x256 colors. The SVGA screen is
     represented by a GraphicsDevice object and each of the modes is
represented by a GraphicsConfiguration
     object.

     A GraphicsEnvironment can contain one or more GraphicsDevices; in
turn, each GraphicsDevice can have
     one or more GraphicsConfigurations.

     Between them, the GraphicsEnvironment, GraphicsDevice, and
GraphicsConfiguration represent all of
     the information necessary for locating a rendering device or font
on the Java platform and for converting coordinates
     from u ser space to device space. An application can access this
information, but does not need to perform any
     transformations between user space and device space. 


---

these classes describe the graphics equpiment and scuh, Screen would be
an abstraction of only the screen for the purpose of containging the
desktop.

more on this after I finish reading.

Subject: [JOS-UI] PowerController, SystemEvent and JADE

Modern computers can be shutdown via the OS, JOS as a modern OS needs to
support this. A PowerController class would be a singelton that
interfaced to the kernel that lets you turn off the computer, reboot it,
put it in sleep mode, et al. the UI would have a shutdown action that
called the shutdownDialog that just called the PowerController. The OS
would have to tell every process, via a SystemEvent? (or a PowerEvent?)
to close. JADE would send a windowClosing event to all its frames, the
various components in JOS would shutdown (and serialize if applicable)
and then the computer would be told to shutdown

since PowerController dosent know what is in JOS (some of it being
dynamic, some of it being add ons or whatever) there should be a
[System|Power]Event of some sort that is sent to all its componenent and
applications (non-JOS stuff will have the legacy equiv. called by its
parent system (an app told to exit via its process).

basically the idea is PowerController is called by UI or other, it sends
events, stuff shutdown. computer goes night-night.

I see you have reached the heart of the problem:  The toolkit cannot be
changed once one has been loaded.  It's an issue with Sun's code that I
don't know how to deal with.  I can post a snippet of where the problem
exists in java.awt.Toolkit, if it's legal to post.(?)

I have Heise's code.   It doesn't work on the new JDK.

I am running JDK1.2.1 on Solaris 2.6.

OK, whatever.  In my opinion, the package location is trivial at this
point.  That's the easiest thing to change, and can be done on a
moment's notice.  Since I'm not posting on CVS or SourceServer, why does
it matter right now?

Well, I figured that because Window and Frame are similar in standard
AWT, then if one is lightweight, both should be.  Besides, it's not good
practice to make each component or container a Window.  You set yourself
up for circular references because the AWT hierarchy specifies that
Window is a Container.  IMO, component and container are the only
heavyweight peers needed.  In looking at the API, apparently Container
has no peer of its own.  The ContainerPeer interface is only so a base
class can be provided for Panel, Window and their descendents.  The
Container class uses a ComponentPeer, which means that lightweight
containers handle all their containees themselves.  Therefore we only
need to override ComponentPeer and LightweightPeer to interface with the
graphics guts.

Sean

it is trivial at this point but we might as well get used to doing it
this way, just as a good practice. the experimental.wikiname part is the
most important part IMO.

Technically Window would be lightweight in that scenario to, its kinda
impossible to have a traditional heavyweight component the way were
doing it. But I meant the Window should be the only one that interfaces
to the screen since everything else either has to go into it
(Components, Container...) or descends from it (Frame).

OK, I see what you mean.  But maybe we could just create some
Toolkit-level entity that does the work of a traditional heavyweight
window.  Right now, we have to have a heavyweight window to hold the
top-level JDesktopPane, but maybe in the future a JOSDesktop or
something of the sort could do the work of the current kludge.

I just looked at the JOSToolkit peers done by sean cribbs, currently the
way its set up its like this:

(Component)-[peer]--(JComponent)-[ui]

which is good for now, but I think the optimal setup is making the peer
a quasicomponent that lets the swing ui class plug directly into it,
like:

(Component)-[peer]-[ui]

At the very least it would take up less memory and probably be a tad
faster.

I agree that a direct ui connection would be much faster, however, I
chose to create them the first way for several reasons:

1) We don't have to implement the peer-level functionality of each
component, we only have to make wrappers to the already-implemented
functionality of the Swing-level component.
2) If the user decides to change the look and feel, the peers would have
to be notified in some way so that they don't maintain links to the old
UI delegates.
3) Wrapping Swing components into the peers is easier than using the
delegates (i.e. I'm lazy).  Besides, when a UI is asked to draw, it
requires a JComponent to be passed.  Why not just leave all of the
complications to Swing?

Anyway, that's my 2c in my defense.

Later,

Sean

That shouldnt be to hard, we'd just need to copy how they do in Swing...

well thats fine for now, but Im saying eventually we should redo it the
better way and we might as well figure out how to do it now.

Either it runs all of the old code or it doesn't. People want code that
works. They don't want excuses. They want to hear that your code still
works. And it will survive the next half-dozen upgrades.

I'm sorry the old code doesn't work. I don't want this kind of thing to
happen each time we upgrade to a new version of JOS. Sun Microsystems
believes that the new JDK is compatible enough to run all of the old code.
And then, they have a long, long list of exceptions.

The old code I wrote doesn't work on the new JDK. I believe that this is a
threat to an open source project. Why should we write a bunch of code for
Java 2.0 (1.2) code if it isn't going to work on Java 3.0?

It stings. It hurts. It's rude. Sun Microsystems should be ashamed of
themselves. They use a practice that doesn't work. It doesn't have to be
that way.

That's why we should not immitate Sun Microsystems when we create a JOS
API. That is why it is so important to try to make long-lasting interfaces
for these JOS-related things.

I don't know what else to do about it. I keep hammering away at the bad
attitudes. It is not acceptable to build reasonable incompatibility.
Reasonable incompatibility means that it doesn't have to work. Heise's code
should work today on a JDK 2.0 just as it did when it was written. Isn't
that what Write Once really means?

When I first read this, I laughed out loud. That's probably the most
rediculous package name I ever did see. I thought for sure it was a _joke_. :)

And then, Sean seems to have take this seriously. Don't do it. Please don't
use such a convoluted and irrelevant package name. And, it is important for
the community to find the right package name as soon as possible.

Since Sean is working on it and we're not quite sure where it fits in the
org.jos packages, you might call it seancribbs.peer_ui for now. Sean, if
you own your own Internet domain, you might call it yourdomain.peer_ui for
now. But don't put it in the org.jos packages. And certainly don't put it
inside the entirely redudant experimental package.

So what if peer_ui uses jade. Since my application uses java.io, should I
put it inside java.io.myapp? What if my application uses both java.io and
java.net? How to I put my app in both java.io.myapp and java.net.myapp?

The longest JOS-related package on my computer is called
com.realignsoft.masterregistry1a.io.test, just 5 packages deep. I can find
no justification to make any package deeper than that. It's more trouble
than it's worth. It just gets in the way. Every time I make deeper packages
I end up in deep trouble.

After a package is built, has been fully tested, and everybody likes it,
you might consider finding a place for it inside the jos or org.jos
namespace. And, you have to be conservative even then.

Subject: [JOS-UI] Swing peers

Hi,

    For the Swing Peers, right now, the model is like that

  AWT -> AWT Peers -> "Swing Peers" --> AWT --> AWT Peers --> Native Peers

That's a very complicated Model that we will have if we use SwingToolkit.
But is that possible to reduce it. I think it can reduce lots of memory and
increase
the speed in both current JVM and future JOS.

Hilary

Hi Sean. When I wrote SwingToolkit, JDK 1.2 was not available for Linux.
And I'm not surprised that it doesn't work considering that it is
incomplete. I really just got it to the stage where I demonstrated that
such a thing could be done, and hoped that other people would finish it.
It's good to see you're aiming to go all the way.

As Regier pointed out, I have solved some of the initialization problems
associated with Toolkits. The README file explains the approach I've
taken. Feel free to take a look.

I will have to read the list archives to get up to speed on this
discussion (I fell off the gui list when we changed list servers, and
I've just rejoined). I will take a look at your source code some time.

There is another Swing based window manager out there called Shark
(available on http://www.gjt.org/). The author has also written his own
native Graphics class to draw directly to the screen rather than reusing
java.awt.Window.

SwingToolkit isn't exactly a 100% pure Java application. The sort of
task SwingToolkit is designed to do requires a lot of trickery and you
can't expect it to work when Sun makes the slightest change to its
libraries. This is the sort of software that needs to be updated
frequently to be compatible with new JVMs. Any code that is close to the
core of JOS is likely to have this same attribute.

I don't expect that standard JOS applications will run into the same
problems. I have certainly not encountered any problems.

> Isn't
> that what Write Once really means?

No. Write Once means that if you write an application against Swing
1.02, it will run on any Java platform that has Swing 1.02 without
having to rewrite it. If a Java platform has Swing 1.1, your application
needs to be upgraded to work with the new Swing. It is possible to have
both versions of Swing installed on your computer and run different
applications against different versions of swing as necessary.

Having two versions of the JDK installed is another thing, though, and
could be difficult to handle in JOS. Luckily, JDK 1.2 is largely
backward compatible with JDK 1.1. One obvious difference is in the
threads API but Java developers have had sufficient warning to stop
calling stop() that there are unlikely to be many problems when
upgrading to JDK 1.2.

you have a point, I agree.

as for a final destination I think we should have an org.jos.jade
package and it be in the subpackage awt (org.jos.jade.awt).

It doesn't use jade, its part of jade (IMO at least). I think we need to
have a sepereation between UI and OS, a UI is just an app used to
communicate with the OS.

Subject: [JOS-UI] Design

Its somewhat well agreed that we should split the design of the overall
OS into several sections:

JOSBox--JOSystem--Apps(including JADE) 

JOSBox is the virtual hardware, it consists of the real hardware, the
picokernel, and the JVM; its where all the native code is. A "windows
JOSBox" or a "linux JOSBox" can be made so JOS can be run on top of
another OS without having to modifiy it.

JOSystem is of two parts, JOSCore which is the absolute minimum required
for (and can be thought of a second, all java, kernel) JOS to be JOS
(including the generic extension mechanism for...) JOSExtensions which
will be grafted to JOS at runtime via JOSCore and will consist of things
that arent part of minimum JOS, but will include very common things too
(ie a file system). JOSCore holds process and security managers and via
its configuration metamechanism loads one predefined process only at
startup, the default for this being JADE (which the user can then launch
more apps from...)
 
Apps are what people use the OS for, the UI is an app. JADE is the UI,
it lets people run and interact with apps, it provides everything needed
for various types of UI's, like an AWT Toolkit for a GUI. JADE handles
the various process cycles of Apps so non-JOS apps dont have to worry
about it (or more importantly, be aware of).

Given that, we need to design the basic structure for these various
sections. we cant really do anything until we have a basic design, a
basic idea of what to do.  We should discuss what we need/want on our
various levels of expertise until we get a basic design to build off of
(JOS starts, it loads this which looks like that and then...)

lets get a crackin'

Could we rewrite ClassLoader so that we can load the AWT Toolkit be4 the
default one ?

Last things, would JOS depends on JDK1.2 or JDK1.1 ? Two JDK's Graphics

Actually, that may not be necessary.  There's an idea brewing in my head

I would hope that JOS will support the latest JDK, whatever version it
will be, when it is released.  For now, I think we should assume JDK1.2
-- it has more functionality and is mostly backwards compatible.

When you build a platform, you must act responsibly. You must not undermine
your own customers. I do expect it to work. I can and should expect it to
work. What gives Sun the right to break all my code? What gives Sun the
right to make even the slightest change to its libraries? There is no
justification for it. We're all worse off because Sun imagines that it's
acceptable. Why do you accept it? It doesn't have to be this way.

>I don't expect that standard JOS applications will run into the same

You need to raise your expectations. Java, with its interface mechanism and
very large namespace, has the potential to maintain perfect compatibility.
Java has this potential even if Sun doesn't see it.

Haven't you suffered poor quality software long enough? It is poor quality
to build a platform that doesn't last. Java 1.1 is a platform. In spite of
what Sun wants, that platform is going to be around for more than two
years. People have invested heavily in Java 1.1. What gives Sun the right
to throw all their customer's code away? Who's code is it anyway?

And I don't want JOS to become obsolete the moment that Java 3.0 is
released by Sun Microsystems. Why should I waste my time?

Think about what you're saying. You're saying that it is acceptable to port
your Java applications from one version of Java to the next...when you
don't have to. I think Write Once means Write Once, without qualification.
It does not mean what Sun Microsystems says it means. It does not write
once per version. There must be no fine print.

I don't want to write once per version. Neither do any of my customers. To
hear that it was possible to write once, and only once, was an inspiration
to us all. It got the whole industry excited again. Sun doesn't mean write
once when they say Write Once. Sun is lost. That doesn't mean that I have
to be lost just like they are.

Largely backward compatible is another way of saying incompatible. It is
either compatible or it's not. If it's mostly compatible, almost
compatible, slightly compatible, it is incompatible. Incompatible is
unacceptable.

Sufficient warning is another way of saying insufficient architecture.
There should be no reason to warn people about added functionality. Warning
implies that there is some kind of threat. How could added functionality be
a threat to you? When you add functionality properly, there is no warning,
only good news. You can do things that you've never been able to do before.
You can do things with less effort than before.

We add functionality all of the time. That is the mainstream of what we do.
That may be all we do. We should not be afraid of adding functionality. It
should not the enemy. If it is, there can be only one conclusion: we are
doing something wrong.

Hello,

IMHO, Java is much to immature for you to expect it to last unchanged
in its current form.  It's going to continue to change in
non-compatible ways for many more years as people uncover problems and
generate fixes.  

Look at any other programming language and you will see similar changes
during its formative years... Even a relatively mature language like
C++ just became standardized and many implementations still need to
change (in non-compatible ways) to support the standard.  And let's not
even start with other languages like fortran that have gone through
MAJOR changes to stay alive.  If java were to not evolve (and radically
so in the beginning) it would remain immature and practically useless.

In addition, as you point out, Java is more than just a language, its a
platform.  So in many ways you must treat it like an operating system. 
No one expects OS's to stay 100% backward compatible between versions. 
And I've yet to see any OS that thought it was so well designed that it
didn't need to make changes that breaks some or all old programs
between versions.  

I would full expect the first full rev of the JVM (when the
implementation goes from 1.x to 2.0) to actually change the VM spec.
using experience gained with the current VM.  Probably something to use
some of those undefined byte codes for optimization or as an escape to
another byte code set for efficiency/speed/etc or introducing some
general purpose "registers"...

IMHO, Java is still very bleeding edge and you need to expect the
ground to constantly shift under you at a moment's notice... If you
like stability, you should probably stick with a more mature technology
like C on unix where changes are much more incremental.  This is
definitely not to say that I don't want you working on JOS.  I just
think your expectations of the technology are a bit high.

I agree.  I also think that while this discussion has its place, we
should concentrate on design and development.  Bashing and flaming don't
get us anywhere.  Besides, this list is about UI details.  The
discussion above might be more appropriate on the general discussion
list.

Gilbert,

That is all fine and dandy, but there is nothing we can do about the
incompatibilities that Sun introduces.  Sun has created a standard, and
whether that standard is flawed or perfect, we are responsible to implement
that standard so that every application behaves like it is running in an
environment exactly compatible with the version of the standard it was
written to.  If we do not implement the standard, and instead try to
'correct' it, we are ourselves introducing incompatibilities into the
platform.  Suddenly someone writing an application on JOS doesn't
automatically get compatibility with Java on Win32.  

The best thing we can do is to work around those incompatibilities.  We can
implement the class libraries once for each version of the JDK.  When we run
an application written to 1.02, we run it with the 1.02 class libraries.
When we run an application written to 1.2, we run it with 1.2 class
libraries.  If an application was written to Swing 1.0.3, then we run it
with Swing 1.0.3.  If the latest and greatest, then we run it with the
latest and greatest.  It means that the user will have to configure what
versions are to be used with what applications.  (using your registry,
perhaps?)  It means that we have to provide mulit-process support in our JVM
so that every application behaves like it is running alone in a seperate
instance of the JDK, because that is the assumption the JDK makes.  This is
the only reasonable thing we can do to solve this problem such that every
application runs robustly as the developer expected it to when he wrote it,
whichever JDK he wrote it for.

In the meantime, we have a technical issue brought about by Sun's decisions.
We don't have the capabliity described above yet, though we will try to work
towards it.  Let the developers do what they need to do in the meantime to
just make it work.

Regards,
Avery J. Regier

Subject: [JOS-UI] Compatibility might be off-topic

Some of you might believe that my concern about compatibility is off-topic
for the user-interface mailing list. You might not see the a connection.
You might not be concerned right now with the run-time compatibility of the
user-interface three to five years down the road. You may be more
interested in these other things.

Yes, we need a place to play. It is just experimental, right? So, it
doesn't have to be compatible with anything. It is just a learning
experience, right? So, there's no reason to be overly concerned at this
point. If we're going to build JADE-UI (or just-another dead-end
user-interface), if we're not going to build on the strenght of the Java
platform, why bother?

How do you maintain your enthusiasm for something you know--for sure--isn't
going to last? Have your given all this, both the user-interface and all
programs that depend on that user-interface, a death sentence?

But I can still see a connection. With Java, it is possible to build a
user-interface subsystem that never becomes obsolete. It is possible to
build a subsystem that looks forward to innovation, embraces change, and
keeps on running all the old code, too. It is possible to give this a
chance to grow, multiply, and live.

Java, the programming language, is a fundamentally different programming
language. It is the first of its kind. There is nothing like it. It is
fundamentally different for these three reasons.

1. It is based exclusively on dynamic linking.
2. It has separate, self-contained interfaces.
3. It has a very large namespace.

It is new. It does not have an architecture like C or C++ at all. It sets a
new standard. You can do things with Java that have never been done before.
With this new standard, we must have new expectations. Before there was
Java, we couldn't build a future-oriented operating system with a
future-oriented user-interface.

People have reached a concensus that you can't build for the future with
COBOL, Visual Basic, Fortran, Pascal, and RPG. It's true. It is not
feasible to build a future-oriented platform with these old languages. Even
Linux is reaching backward into the past.

Sun Microsystems built a new and incompatible abstract windowing toolkit
(called the AWT). They used Java; but, they did not build on the strength
of Java. What then? They built yet another new and incompatible abstract
windowing toolkit (called Swing). They used Java again...and almost found
out what Java can do when you put your mind to it.

What is the point of building yet-another-toolkit? There is untapped
potential here to create a user-interface above and beyond anything the
world has ever seen. We can build a masterpiece.

Imagine this: you can build two, three or four user-interfaces that run
simultaneously on a single machine. You're free to experiment, without
getting yourself into trouble. You can build bridges between the old and
the new. You can run old applications in the latest and greatest
user-interface, without changing a line of code (if that's what you want).

The rules have changed. Java changed the rules. What sounds radical and
impossible on all of the other operating systems may become routine and
taken for granted on JOS.

Give compatibility a chance.

I agree that compatibility is an issue worthwhile discussing. I just
have a few constructive things to add to the discussion:

- Sun give (IMHO) sufficient warning of API changes through the use of
the @deprecated javadoc tag. In this way, if Sun plans to remove a
method from the API, it takes two JDK versions to happen. In the next
version, the method is still there but deprecated. In the version after,
it may be removed.

- Sun appears to have used this tool effectively, except with Swing
which underwent a package renaming. Obviously the @deprecated tool
cannot be used here, and coincidently it was this Swing incompatibility
that fired the discussion off.

I don't see the point in bashing Sun, but I do see that compatibility is
something that we should consider. It is conceivable that Sun could, for
example, change the JVM specification making new JVMs incompatible with
older JVMs, or that they could make incompatible changes to the JDK
libraries. However, call me short-sighted but I just don't think it is
something worth worrying about now -- at this point in the project
timeline. Someone will need to think about these issues in the future.
Actually, you sound quite keen. Why don't you come up with a proposal?

worth worrying about, but on JOS general mailing list please

> Actually, you sound quite keen. Why don't you come up with a proposal?

Gilbert, he is quite correct. maybe you could get JDK 2.0 (or Java 3 or
Java:the next genertation, or whatever Sun decided to call the bloody
thing) to only put the essentials in the java package and the rest in
javax where it should be, maybe you could even talk them into
multiprocess VM's.

But please from now on discuss this is on the JOS general mailing list,
I dont want to remove anyone. last thing I want to be is censor morum
people; this is the *last* warning.

Looks good! So JADE is responsible for initializing the graphics
context? (It appears that way.)  I'm not incredibly familiar with
JavaBeans, but maybe we should make the screen saver a bean, so that it
is easily configurable and could be embedded into applications or the
desktop environment.  There should probably be an option for double
buffering, too.

Maybe something we can work on soon is a taskbar/bean container widget
for the UI.  That would be fun and we could test it right away (I like
things I can get a good grip on!)

I think I'll follow your footsteps and name the tookit-peer package
seancribbs.jade.core. =Þ

Later,

Your absolutley right, what ever I was thinking when I said that is...
well.

What we should do is have a JOSToolkit that provides all the base
functionality, like getSystemClipboard() isnt going to change, then have
various subclasses like SwingToolkit to provide the default
implementations. I think we could use the Toolkit in a CLI anyway for
stuff like beep() and that just throw something akin to a
GraphicsNotSupportedException.

Now that I think about it we could define the default JADE toolkit to
get a HashMap from the registry and create the peers from that... (the
default being the Swing ones)

or we could follow KOH (the DOS virus people intentinally let on their
systems to encrypt all their disks) with extra security of course, and
just for the hell of it encrypt the security section of the registry and
require superuser access just to be asked for the pass phrase (you'd
need a small nuclear weapon to get throught that ;)

exatcly!

system <> JADE <> UI

couldnt have said it better myself

the system is considered with doing... um, system stuff not looking

I imagine this getProgram method to be incredibly complex and Im sure as

JADE uses the system to interact with the user, I can think of know
better example then the graphics context.

Im pretty well versed in JavaBeans and can see no reason to make it a
JavaBean, why embed a screensaver in an application? it configures

Well, I'm just glad it works!  Took long enough to get to this point,
didn't it?

(1) However, I confess I forgot (if I ever knew definitively) who's
doing the keyboard driver, and who's doing the VGA driver.

(2) With respect to drivers, there's the recurring issue of how to get
all this code written by all these different people to play together
nicely.  With the JVM, the interface spec was pretty well-defined (it
was the JVM spec -- not too much room for creativity there!).  Getting
the JVM and the pico/femto (whatever) kernel to play together nicely
only entailed Todd and I working together.  However, with the drivers,
and with the address spaces (etc.), things are pretty nebulous, and
there are a LOT more people involved.

I was thinking we could just reimplement the "JavaOS for Business" APIs,
which seem pretty well thought out to me.  There is a sort of "registry"
(which I know there's been a lot of discussion about on the JOS lists)
which unifies (as near as I can tell from the "Inside JavaOS" book) the
WIndoze-type registry, and the UNIX-type "device" hierarchy, and it
provides a mechanism for booting and device discovery, and even dynamic
device discovery (e.g., removable media), etc.  I'd be interested in
what people on the kernel list have to say about this.

Please be so kind as to open URL:
	http://jos.org/pipermail/admin/1999-July/000110.html
which discusses the issue, and respond to the kernel list.  There was no
response on the admin list.  (I'm also cc-ing the UI folk, because this
touches upon the VGA/SVGA/whatever driver issue, and I'm also cc-ing the
general list, because it's a general issue.)

Thanks,

Point taken (re: JADE/GC).  The reason why I thought the screen saver
should be a bean is so that it could be imbedded in an application or
taskbar and invoked at will.  Perhaps this is not such a great idea. 
Maybe instead, we can have a bean that provides that functionality, but
not necessarily the screen saver be one.  A well defined interface is
good enough for me!

Do you mean you have a taskbar in development, or that you were going to
test the screen saver?

A bean to run the screensaver would be nice I guess, although Id think
the AWT thread for JADE after detecting X minutes of 0-activity tells
JADE to run the scrensaver (if ones set) at which point it handles all
that. a bean would just be an animation using the screensaver as the
painter... hmm, in windows you have that little monitor where you see
the screensaver running in the config dialog I could make a bean that
could be used in our screensaver config pane... (and as the runner for
the testbox (below))

JADE would give the screensaver the entire screen after telling the
other apps to take a rest (not sure how but it would have to do it so
they couldnt paint anymore, possibly take a snap shot of the screen for
the saver to use and set the GC the apps use to an offscreen buffer so
they could continue updating while the screensaver is running...) and
the AWTThread's output would be entirely for JADE and on any activity
the screensaver is shutdown and everythings set back to normal

> Do you mean you have a taskbar in development, or that you were going to

I mean Im going to make a testbox for the screensaver (I'd have done it
by now but I was working on something else).

as far as a taskbar goes thats a bit of a tricky subject, I mean a) we'd
need a way of knowing what tasks there are b) it cant be the only way to
do it (some UI's might not have one) c) what constitutes a TaskBar? do
we include a clock/systemtray thing or is that separate (it should be)?
how do we show the association, beancontext?

we'll need to discuss the general idea of how JADE is going to handle
"standard" components for the TGUI first

I agree.  In my opinion a "taskbar" could mean anything from the Win95
style taskbar, to Apple's Finder, to the CDE Desktop/application bar to
the AfterStep docking/menu bar.  What I mean is a desktop-level widget
that provides convenient ways to launch applications, switch between
virtual desktops, change UI settings, etc.; this widget would be a
central control for navigating and managing the UI.  As far as keeping
track of which tasks are running, it could simply create a new entry for
each application launched from one of its menus or a Run box.

The reason why I think it should be a bean container is so that
applications can "dock" like in the GNOME desktop, or minimize to the
system tray, like in Windows (although I prefer the former).  This way,
applications that do things like display the system clock, play audio or
CDs, download files, etc. can make themselves both accessible and
unobtrusive.

A CLI isnt going to have a taskbar, a XUI might not. JADE cant assume
there is a taskbar, if there was a taskbar its only interaction would be
that it uses JADE to get things like the process manager (to create the
list of tasks) so a taskbar is part of the UI and is part of a JADE
plug-UI but is not part of the core JADE its self. also, what if system
y doesnt have Swing? it would need an AWT taskbar. the answer is all the
desktop widgets must be designed via interface.

public interface Taskbar extends DesktopWidget {
 //bla bla bla
}

Defaults for building the "default JOS UI" will be implemented in Swing
of course. the best part is a single component could take on more then
one widget function like: "X implements TaskBar, Clock".

infact we should make (abstract?) Swing components of more general use
then extend them for the default UI

JOSTaskBar extends GeneralTaskBar

This issue can be easily solved using a Model/View/Controller model. We
explored MVC in some detail about a year ago on this list. The idea of a
process manager matches the concept of a "model", while the taskbar is
an example of a "view". You may have already been aware of the
similarity, but speaking in terms of MVC will probably lead to a clearer
design.

For those who missed the discussion way back then, I think we decided on
a combination of Java Beans and MVC, where model beans maintained data
structures such as process lists and window lists, while view beans
implemented displays or user interfaces of those data structures.

For example, there may be a view that displays the list of open windows
- the user could click on a window item to raise that window on the
desktop (yes, like that significant component of the taskbar). There
could be another "view" of the same window list "model" that shows your
miniature virtual desktops. This view would mirror the exact window
positions of each window on a smaller scale but allow you to select
windows in the same way as the taskbar. The most interesting view is
actually the window manager itself. It should also be a view of the
window list.

"Window list" is not necessarily the best way to divide the model space
but it is enough to demonstrate the concept.

This corresponds to a view. I have no objection to the term "widget",
but you should also think up a term that corresponds to "model". I know
I haven't mentioned "controller" yet. Typically a controller is
responsible for handling a use case in a system. Swing uses a modified
MVC model where the controller is combined with the view. The argument
is that creating a separate controller class for everything can be an
overkill. This is probably the way to go unless we can foresee a
specific need to have controllers separate.

we also decided that virtual windows would be handled by a special JADE
PUI that allows other UI's to plug into it (I know what your saying but
I wanted to remind us)

say the DesktopScreen (extends Screen extends OutputDevice?) has an
inner class WindowManager which does all that nasty window overlap code
(gracefully, of course) this would be the 'M', the TaskbarWidget
(TaskbarController?) would be the 'C' and whatever component implements
that would be the 'V'

so we leave the M up to the OS/JADE to be reperesented as best they can
and put the VC into the widgets (or whatever)?

Graphics handling can get messy if you keep a reference to your own
graphics context. There was once a problem with a Windows JVM where you
could not have open more than 5 or 6 graphics contexts without exceeding
the resource limit. Graphics contexts are intended to be short term
objects. They are also intended to be used from within the AWT thread -
I'm not sure exactly what could go wrong if you don't but I could
imagine swing getting confused. It likes to manage Graphics contexts
itself since most of the graphics handling stuff is written in Java
(instead of native peers).

If you extend Window, you will inherit a similar method. It may sound
like I'm suggesting that you extend Window. I don't actually mind. You
could extend Canvas. You could define an interface with a paint() method
just like Component. Luckily, the screensaver module is isolated enough
that you can easily change your design as many times without breaking
much.

ScreenSaver only extends Object, its not a component

Subject: [JOS-UI] screensaver update

Ive been working on the SSDK (ScreenSaverDevelopmentKit) as I worked on
it I realized I had to make some changes to ScreenSaver (better now then
later) but anyway it consists of:

ScreenSaver                       (abstract)
ScreenSaverUser                   (interface)
SwingScreenSaverUser
PreviewScreenSaver
PreviewScreenSaver.PreviewWindow
JADEScreenSaverConfigurationPanel (name-may-change)

ScreenSaver is the class ScreenSaver's extends from, all they need to
implement is init and paint, but it can greatly extend its
functionality.

ScreenSaverUser is an interface defining a class that uses a
screensaver, it has one method void setScreenSaver(ScreenSaver ss); both
SwingScreenSaverUser and PreviewScreenSaver implement it.

SwingScreenSaverUser is a JComponent that renders the ScreenSaver in its
graphics (needs work)

PreviewScreenSaver is an app that previews a ScreenSaver in a full
screen window (its inner class)

JADEScreenSaverConfigurationPanel is a JPanel that has a list of
screensavers to select from, it uses a small SwingScreenSaverUser to
show a basic idea of it and has a preview button that opens a
PreviewScreenSaver (as it is designed so it doesnt have to run as an app
only)

the SSDK cant be considered "done" until I have a strong registry to
implement the list of available screensavers, it also needs it to make
the configuration persist (Id rather not have it persist then do a
workaround to un workaround later) 

the JADEScreenSaverConfigurationPanel needs a way to tell Jade to use
this screensaver after x minutes, I assume it will also eventually
extend something else like PropertyPage (something else Im working on)

I will only consider this version .5 until I get the registry and then
only .9, having the screensaver being set makes it version 1

Oh, I know.  There will most definitely be many user interfaces, and
each could have (or not) its own taskbar widget.  Certainly a CLI won't
have one.

Good idea!

I wasn't speaking of _THE_ taskbar widget for JOS, just working on a
prototype so that we can figure out what is involved, what APIs need to
be created or modified, etc.

Why not?

Imagine a text-based taskbar in the top of the console.

Ok, but not in the GUI sense. It won't have a component-based
construction, unless someone is willing to tackle a text-based gui and
toolkit and all the fun that goes with that! (believe me, I've tried
with Graphical ones, it's pretty hard)

Ok. It was just a suggestion. Someone will implement it, I'm certain.

Ok so we have

interface Taskbar extends Widget (?)

class Taskbar extends JPanel implements Taskbar

class JOSTaskbar extends Taskbar implements Dockable, Hideable (to side)

so what goes in?

I use widget in a broad sense not tied to either the AWT or Swing.

JADE's widgets should be defined in this broad sense, hence we should
define them first as interfaces create a default set using swing then
extends that to create the "JOS Standard GUI" widgets.

here's all the widgets I can think of

Widget
 |
 +-DesktopWidget
 |
 +-ClockWidget
 |
 +-DockWidget
 |
 +-TaskbarWidget
 |
 +-ToolbarWidget
 |
 +-PropertyPageWidget

Widget is the super interface (it doesnt even have to define any
methods).

DesktopWidget represents the actual desktop and has methods for moving
windows around, adding widgets (like a taskbar) and the like. I see the
class DesktopScreen (extends Screen implements DesktopWidget) being the
default desktop, as extensible and flexible as possible, and using the
default AWT/Swing component model. it would be rare that a different
Desktop would be used (except in the case of no Desktop or a text
desktop for a TUI)

ClockWidget is the system clock with date and time, better name? anyone?

DockWidget is a systemtrayish beandock like we talked about, it accepts
classes implementing Dockable

TaskbarWidget is the taskbar

ToolbarWidget is a toolbar for the desktop, with docking (&locking) to
the sides

PropertyPageWidget is like a "control panel" (in windows it would
encapsulate all the tabs accesed via Properties... in a context menu)
this would most likely be implemented as TabbedPanes but it shouldnt be
required to use it (1 tab looks silly, and if you have enough to create
two rows of panes you should use a JList holding the titles instead)

the standard windows9x taskbar would be implemented via a JWindow that
implements ToolbarWidget and TaskbarWidget (or more likely extends
SimpleToolbarWidget (our swing generic implementation) and implements
TaskbarWidget) and would contain a button/menu for the start menu, the
system tray would be a JPanel that implements ClockWidget and DockWidget
(rhyming unintentional)

The mac pulldown menu thing (I dont remember what its called) would be a
JMenuBar implementing ToolbarWidget (so it could plater itself on to the
desktop like that, it would return false for hideable and draggable (or
not implement those interfaces?))

the discussion to follow should include A) what widgets to include (and
what to name them) and B) what methods to put in them and how it would
be supported in JADE.

everything else (providing the "SimpleXXXWidget"'s) can wait until we
have this framework setup

DigiGod

If you take the MVC approach, the methods in DesktopWidget would not be
at all interesting. In fact DesktopWidget could be defined to have no
methods. Instead, we have the following design:

class DesktopModel
 - showWindow(win)
 - hideWindow(win)
 - selectWindow(win)
 - disposeWindow(win)
 - moveWindow(win, x, y)
 - resizeWindow(win, w, h)

interface DesktopListener
 - windowShown(event)
 - windowHidden(event)
 - windowSelected(event)
 - windowDisposed(event)
 - windowMoved(event)
 - windowResized(event)

Then perhaps:

class SwingDesktopWidget extends JDesktopPane implements Widget
{
	class SwingDesktopListener implements DesktopListener
	{
		public void windowShown(DesktopEvent e)
		{
			findWindow(e.getWindow()).setVisible(true);
		}
	}
}

As you can see, there is no need for a DesktopWidget interface that
defines methods to move windows around. In MVC, you would call
controller.moveWindow(...) to move the window. As a result, all
DesktopListeners will be notified through the windowMoved() method,
which as you can see I have handled with an inner class to prevent
people from calling these methods directly.

I mentioned in another email that you don't really need a separate
controller class, SwingDesktopWidget could interact directly with
DesktopModel to move the window but SwingDesktopWidget itself has no
public methods to move a window. It is not an interface for moving
windows, it is just a view that internally is allowed to move windows.

Now, the class design above was just given to demonstrate MVC. It is not
necessarily the best design. It is possible to divide DesktopModel into
a finer set of model components.

If you go with MVC, the first step is to define the *Model, *Listener
and *Event interfaces. As for the Widget interfaces, I think you will
need only a single Widget interface. The requirements for the view layer
will become clearer later on.

DesktopWidget would also have to handle adding and removing
ToolbarWidgets and Im sure other things but thats slightly offtopic. 

The only point of the widget interface was to act as a parent to the
others. The widget interfaces are supposed to be an abstract way of
defigning the view, the view could be in Swing, AWT, or something else
in all cases it just has to implement the widget type(s).

I think making the desktop a JDesktopPane is the worst way to go, it
requires to many messy hacks to work could cause problems with AWT
components and is somewhat small minded design wise. several times Ive
proposed the use of a Screen.

public abstract class Screen

it handles the different types of screens, graphics and text
(TextScreen, GraphicsScreen) its not hooked to Swing (it does, however,
use many AWT classes; like GraphicsContext getGraphicsContext() and the
like), its better OO a desktop is not a swing container, its a container
but not in that sense.

public class DesktopScreen extends GraphicsScreen implements
DesktopWidget (whatever that entails)

...would be the standard Screen used for any TGUI (especially the JOS
default UI, lets call it GEM, no reason) it would handle the background
(via a pluggable Background class) the Icon Layer (which is optinal and
should be handled by another extension class) it handles window
managment (this while may be done by an inner class doesnt have to be
pluggable, only one way to do it) and at the top it handles "desktop
components" that is ToolbarWidgets (which could include stuff like a
TaskbarWidget/DockWidget/ToolbarWidget implementin' JWindow) it would
also handle the ScreenSaver. it acts as a container/controller for all
these things and it hands down the graphics objects to them.

I think this is the most flexible way to go, I also think this is not
the time to discuss it (Im sorry I brought it up)

we should decide what types of interfaces to design for the views and
what to put in them, we could make a cheap imitation of a Desktop with a
JWindow or even a JDesktopPane to test on, but I doubt will get that far
so soon.

keep the comments/suggestions comin'

Again, removeToolbarWidget() is very similar to disposeWindow(). For the
same reason, I believe it should be a method on the model (and
controller). I think you will find that some widgets (including
DesktopWidget) will need to define /some/ public methods to handle
direct interactions between views (widgets). I have found this
unavoidable, but those methods are subordinate to the methods provided
by the model (and controller). They would be needed, for example, to
allow a ToolbarWidget component to be added (in AWT terms) to its
Container. This is a direct view <-> view interaction that requires
public widget methods.

Yes, JDesktopPane is probably not the best choice.

There is probably very little you can decide about the view interfaces
at this point in time. When you start to consider how the controllers
and models come in to play, your design will probably change completely.
I definately think it is easier to start designing from the model end.
Even then, your design will change a bit when you start to consider how
the view fits into the picture. But at least when you get there, you
will have already thought about the foundations of your MVC system.

Actually, after messing with my peer-toolkit hack for long enough, I'm
inclined to agree.  Mixing AWT and Swing is just too messy.  Of course,
that doesn't mean we have to forgo having PL&F in standard AWT.  I think
using the Swing UI delegates directly won't work, because one way or
another they require a JComponent (and probably typecast to whatever
subclass they are working with).  Instead, I'm going to investigate
making the L&F pluggable at the peer level.  Since our peers will never
make graphics calls directly through native libraries, but instead
through some Screen or GraphicsDevice object, our system is essentially
lightweight.  I think I will botch my old code and start some new stuff,
mimicing Swing's idea of the UIManager-JComponent connection in the
Toolkit-Peer connection.  Unfortunately, this means that the AWT L&F
will be separate from and independent of the Swing L&F, but I see no
reason why we can't create AWT L&F's that look like the Swing versions. 
Then, hypothetically, a user selecting a particular look and feel could
have the two L&F's changed in tandem.  Anyway, those are my ideas for
now.

Later,

Sean Cribbs

what if all your peers subclassed from JComponent? wouldnt that solve
many of the problems. you create a superclass that does the standard
configuration for JComponent (seeting isOpaque to true and the like) you
wouldnt need to change the L&F's in tandem since the peers would be
linked to the UIManager (I think)

just an idea

we could have a very abstract model, it doesnt even need to be aware of
the components its using, we could represent them as Rectangles to it.
all it would have is a view rectangle (the screen) and a stack of
rectangles that it was in charge of z-ordering and the like. the
controller would handle conversion between windows and rectangles and
the view (DesktopScreen) would render accordingly.

this could be reused by many things, even a UI that doesnt use AWT or
Swing to do windowing (for whatever reason). which bring up something
Ive been wondering about it is possible to make text peers for the AWT
but it translates badly, it could be possible for us to design our own
TWT (think about it) for TUI's, it could extend our classes for basic
CLI stuff. is that good or bad though? (eitherway it should be packaged
outside of JADE org.jos.twt)

oh, there should also be a maximize/restore thing in the wherever that
would go since it is different to the OS then having it resized to
screen size and placed so it covers everything.

you may be right, but we could at least get a basic idea of what we need
to put them in, but more importantly (and Ive tried to stress this) of
which ones to include that list I gave was far from complete, and some
of them should have different, more appropriate, names.

we have all sorts of people who have used allsorts of UI's, we can think
of more widgets as part of our ADW package (abstract desktop widgets?
org.jade.adw and the swing ones in org.jade.adw.simple)

I don't quite see the usefulness of this. For example, when you
implement the Swing or AWT widgets, they will handle rectangles and
z-ordering in their own way.

If you were suggesting the idea in response to my observation that there
needs to be some view <-> view interactions, are you trying to eliminate
these interactions? I think when you get around to implementing your
Swing widgets, you will find that the most sensible thing to do is to
have direct view <-> view interactions when they are needed. For
example, when a JComponent needs to be graphically added to a JPanel.
Just keep in mind that these view <-> view methods are internal
implementation methods, and the real methods to add a ToolbarWidget to a
DesktopWidget are in the controller and model classes.

That's reasonable. Ok,

PagerWidget - control for virtual desktops
MenuWidget - for example, you could dock a start menu to the
TaskBarWidget.

I'm thinking we should call it a system menu, not a start menu.

no, no this isnt what I meant at all. I was reffereing to the windows on
the desktop.

the Model is a collection of rectangles each with a z-order the
"screens" rectangle being a constant last. each window on the desktop is
represented as a rectangle.

the controller is implementation specefic in this case, AWT (which Im
betting would be 99.99% all cases, if not more) it mediates between the
view (the desktop) and the "genderless" model (the rectangles),
translateing the Windows.

the desktop draws itself according to the commands of the controller
which is a translator for the model. (of course the desktop also has to
handle drawing the background and the icons and the screensaver if your
inactive long enough)

I see the benifit not being to us but to those who can use the same
Model since they need, for X reason, to use a different set of
components then AWT. And both the model and controller (and possibly
even the view if done properly) can be reused by the standard Swing/AWT
TGUI's

PagerWidget is a good widget but not to be included in JADE, we decided
awhile ago that a UI/extension to JADE was to be provided that handled
virtual desktops by proxing itself (in the guise of a PUI) between JADE
and the real UI's. the coolest benifit of this being the ability (if
done properly) to plug in X different UI's (assuming support for all) in
the vw's

win95 style context menus would implememnt MenuWidget's too, as would
the menubar thingy on macs (which would also be a toolbar since its
attached to the desktop btw (what is that thing called again?)).

system menu, here here. start menu? start what? at least when you call
it system menu people know what your talking about.

Ah, you are describing standard MVC. The model is reusable and you can
provide different view implementations over the top. I thought you must
have been referring to something else.

So, to answer your original point "we could have a very abstract model",
yes - that is the very idea of MVC.

Yes, the controller is more closely related to its view than it is to
its model. This is why the Swing designers decided to include the
controllers in the view objects themselves.

The only time you could share a controller is if two widget sets have
exactly the same set of functions. Even then, you're introducing a
dependency you don't need to.

More precisely, the controller understands commands in the language of
the view, and translates them into the language of the model.

Ok, but that's really just a variation on what I tried. It would just
make the peers JComponents themselves instead of owning them.  I don't
think that would solve the problems that it has (mainly memory use and
event handling).  Right now, I still can't get my old code to work. I
think the toolkit has to be in the bootclasspath, but I'm not sure.  It
crashes on startup.

But back on the peers having their own UI delegates, maybe we could make
the UIManager handle those delegates.  We'd just create our own look and
feel subclass that defined the keys we want for the new UIs and then the
UIManager could handle them in its normal fashion.  Then when the L&F
changes, they would change too.  No need for separate L&F's.  The only
problem is, if the user selects a Java-based look and feel and not a
JOS-based look and feel, the old values won't change.  Maybe this is
desirable or undesirable behavior, I'm not sure.

Any thoughts?

hi .. i just read the ui discussion about widgets and have some
questions and ideas about it ..(think they are not really finished so
excuse me).

first i want to give you my idea of how JOS should work ...

- the first thing JOS should do on bootup is to initialize the desktop
(like MacOS) so you have no text based views
- with a special keycombination you can now enter the system-setup where
you can add/remove drivers etc

i think of a fully plugable system :

  ROOT
   |- driver
   |  |- sound
   |  |  |- (driver) soundblaster
   |  |  |- (driver) MPU401 comp
   |  |  .
   |  |
   |  |- video
   |  |  |- (driver) VESA gfx
   |  |  |- (driver) OpenGL
   |  |  .
   |  |
   |  |- filesystem
   |  |  |- (driver) JOSFs
   |  |  |- (driver) FAT
   |  |  |- (driver) Amiga FFS
   |  |  .
   |  .
   |
   |- ui
   |  |- desktop
   |  |  |- (desktop) standard JOS desktop _OR_ (desktop) experimental
3D desktop
   |  |  .
   |  |
   |  |- l&f
   |  |  |- (l&f) Swing _OR_ (l&f) MacOS X Server _OR_ ...
   |  |  .
   |  |
   |  .
   .

this should be stored somewhere and all things should be implemented on
startup

of couse you will need interfaces like

  public class W9XlikeDesktop extends JOSDesktop

or

  public class JOSFS_AmigaFFS extends JOSFileSystem

- this should be the maximum the system should provide to the user. all
other things should be plugged into it to asure
  a maximum of configurability

sorry if it is not really part of the ui section.
please give me a response and more of your ideas ...

btw how exactly shold JADE work ? are there any links on the JOS page ?

I disagree.  While I believe that a gui-only system is nice, many people
prefer text-based user interfaces or command-line interfaces.  Plus,
they are much simpler to create and will give us something to test our
code on once the bare-bones system is ready.

Hmm... I don't know if this is necessary because JOS is supposed to
allow users to specify drivers while the system (gui/cli/etc) is
running.  Most driver changes should not require a reboot or special
startup selection procedures.

There are already many packages specified... see the Packages page on
the JOS Wiki.

What are you trying to say?  If you're referring to a registry, there is
already one in the making.

I agree that it should be maximally configurable, but I think it's a
little early to say what initial OOB configuration should be.

AFAIK from discussions with Digigod, JADE is the underlying system upon
which all UIs rest.  It provides things that are common among the UIs,
like receiving keystrokes, handling graphics devices, input devices, and
other output devices.  The other UIs can be then defined using JADE as
the workbeast.  For example, a Traditional GUI would ask JADE to put the
video card in graphics mode, and ask for a specific part of the screen
to draw on.  It would not have to know how all of this is being done. 
JADE is for UIs what OO is for imperative programming -- hiding all the
work behind a nice interface, and making it reusable.

i did not mean JOS should not have a CLI but it should be implemented in
a
graphic environment
but i accept the fact that they are easier to create.

again i just meant that this gives you a startup configuration .. i
_hope_
that driver implementation is realtime ;)

i agree in this concept ... it should be easy to port to other platforms
(not
just x86)

all in one it was just an idea and i wanted you all to know about it ...

Again, I disagree.  There is no reason why a plain, vga text mode
command line interface should not be available.  What if the user is
trying to test an experimental graphics driver?  Certainly it doesn't
make sense to have a GUI already loaded with a graphics-based CLI in
it.  There might be conflicts with the current graphics device (maybe
it's a standard VGA or other driver).

The startup configuration should only be specified at install time. 
After that, all driver changes should be made through tools that access
the registry.  I see no point for a startup configuration change unless
it is to use a minimal configuration (like Windows safe mode).

We would be glad to have you on.  More important than experience is to
have an interest in what you're doing.  If you have the interest, then
you will have the impetus to learn when necessary.

i fear that this method will get out of control like in linux (my opinion) and that
everything is
configured by it's own text file .. i dont think this is good for a customer os
maybe for
an expert os like unix ..
that's the reason why i think that linux will never beat windoze unless somebody
invents a
customer linux (or JOS ;) )

I don't see where the worry you have comes from.  A registry-based
configuration system, if well designed, is amenable to beginning users
as well as advanced ones.  Beginning users will like the pretty user
interfaces for configuring their devices and other system components. 
Advanced users will appreciate that the registry is well organized and
complete.  Even Windows, which largely uses a registry, still holds onto
INI files and the like.  Linux (and other versions of UNIX), which has
no central registry, is even worse, spreading its configuration over
multiple files and directories.  JOS will probably be initially aimed at
power users, but as the included tools and features mature, it will be
easily scalable to a novice.

well I dont know about memory use and event handling but from my

Im sure most users would consider this a bug and a "turn off" the power
users would have long worked around it but there not the ones we need to
make this a success in the classic definition

If the UI for JADE is graphical it should start in graphical mode, if

well the default should be the JOS UI/subsystems and filesystems and the

exactly! I think we should also be careful to seperate JADE and JOSystem
as much as possible. JADE is not part of JOS in the traditional sense,
it is more akin to an application (since some systems wont have a UI at
all)

as far as pages go:

JosPlatform --an old page that gives you the basic gist (or is that with
a 'j'?) of how JOS should be structured
JOSystem    --whats in JOS the OS vs. whats in...
JADE        --the page on JADE also see JADEProjectUpdate

there should be a graphics CLI, but there should also be a text one.
some systems might need a text-only CLI, its the same reason we should
have TUI. the point of JADE is to be unassuming and hence flexible.

If you mean we should allow prestartup configuration AND runtime
configuration I say we should just have one or the other, and by that I
mean runtime configuration

the entire OS is meant to be easily ported from one platform to another,
thats the whole point of making it in Java afterall. the UI can look
like anything anywhere; it could have a mac UI on an intel machine (if
for nothing other then humor)

I think the biggest benefit of a super portable OS like this is in
hardware of all things. when someone makes a revolutionary hardware
architecture they have to code the entire OS and all the apps and then
no ones going to use it since they like there old apps. with JOS all
they have to do is port the JOSBox and possibly slap together some
drivers and such and they have a new architecture that runs every Java
app and has a robust OS that people know how to use from the get go.

even if we dont provide one it should at least be able to be made (we
cant do *everything* afterall)

the whole thing should be dynamic and persistent. if you change UI's and
your system crashes (hopefully from a power out and not JOS) when you
restart the new UI should be loaded since it altered the JADE registry

I wholeheartedly agree with that (even if I did have to look up impetus
:)

Right. We don't want a Windoze/MacOS-like system where one *MUST* have a
working GUI to be able to do anything. I'm personally a command line freak
(the only icon I use is the one that launches xterm :), and as such, as
believe the best way to go is to make sure the system is equally useful
both from the command line and from the GUI. One should *NEVER* have to use
the GUI to accomplish a certain task, just as one should *NEVER* have to use
the command line to accomplish a certain task (in terms of configuring the
system etc...).

Last time I browsed the Wiki it seemed that the general opinion is pretty
much the same. Is that still true? I hope so.=20

It is, the point of JADE is to allow *any* UI to be used with JOS not to
make assumptions

Subject: [JOS-UI] UIPurposeDesktop

this is in response to GilbertHerschberger's article UIPurposeDesktop on
the Wiki (a prerequiste to this e-mail):

personally Ive always thought of the desktop as a pretty background to
the windows Im working with (which I always keep maximized, personal
prefference I guess)

the desktop itself does not run commands, well neither does the
commandline; thats what we have JADE for. JADE processes commands for
all the UI's since they all need to process commands and the only
difference is how they abstract that to the user.

good idea bout a shortcut/link/whatever referencing itself, I wouldnt
have caught that

whats the difference between a bookmark and a link? all I can see is
that bookmarks are further abstracted by the application using them
(with a treeview for editing and pulldown for accessing)

Ive often mentioned my idea of an abstract screen thats extended to a
"DesktopScreen" after reading this article (and some talking on UI) I
think this is a good hierarchy

Screen
 |
 +-TextScreen (CLI's)
 |  |
 |  +-TexttopScreen (TUI's, Desktop... Texttop... get it? in other
words, needs a better name)
 |
 +-GraphicsScreen
    |
    +-DesktopScreen (GUI's)
       |
       +-IconDesktopScreen

Screen is the abstract super class that offers all the stuff they'd all
need (like Dimension size() and all that).

TextScreen is for CLI's and has all that lovely text support stuff

GraphicsScreen is a screen with AWT Graphics Support (probably
subclassed for a 3DGraphicsScreen by XUI's), it has a setBackground
thats lets you set the backfground pic (Im working on a Background class
for general use thats really flexible, animation the whole sh'bang) (or
should this be in DesktopScreen?))

DesktopScreen adds support for moving AWT windows around and drawing
them and all that fun

IconDesktopScreen adds support for icons on the desktop (no fixed
layout, thats what I hate about w9x and mac, I always wanted them across
the top like everywhere else in the bloody OSes)

personally Id just use DesktopScreen let the taskmanager and the
applauncher deal with the rest.

ooh! heres another idea, VirtualScreen extends GraphicsScreen (or just
screen?) and handles switching between different Screen types for true
VirtualScreen support (as handled not by JADE but a JADE PUI (VWSS
--VirtualWindow SupportSystem?) that acts like a socket for other,
mutliple PUI's)

DigiGod
