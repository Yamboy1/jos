<PRE>&gt;<i> So in this respect, yes, an addKeyListener() would be a good solution.  All we
</I>&gt;<i> need then is a JOS-wide event system to manage acynch events.
</I>
	That's the real kicker, isn't it.  AFAIK, the event system concept
hasn't made it into operating systems yet.  (Except maybe JavaOS
itself; I'm checking.)  The major problem regarding
console applications is two-fold: they aren't event based and they
use java.lang.System.in/out/err, which hide redirects -- something
like &quot;jsort &lt; address_book &gt; alpha_address_book&quot; where the j.l.S variables
enscapulate file streams instead of character streams directed at the
console.

	The suggestion you make is a good one in that it moves the
responsibility for event distribution out of the 'kernel' and into
'user-space.'  It also, however, maintains the 'redirection' idea, which
might not be a good thing.  In the AWT, a keylistener subscribes to a
specific Component (i.e. its main window) as the keyspeaker; this
implicitly takes care of event focus problems.  The major problem is the
collision between the streams-based and the event-based models in the 
console application, where there isn't a Component to listen to.

	We must support java.lang.System.in/out/err redirects, simply to
make 'legacy' (non-JOS-aware) java applications function -- as well as
make the shell redirection tools usable and implementable.  The question,
then, becomes:

	We know the application is jos-aware because it wants to listen
for KeyEvents.  Thusly:

	What should the application listen to?  Itself?
jos.system.keyboard?  Suppose the application is jos-aware; it could be
made to inherit from jos.application, in which case the jos.application
code could take care of the necessary event distribution.  This *does*
remove the question one step -- it will be necessary to determine how the
AWT handles distributing events.  Should the application listen to
jos.system.keyboard, it (perhaps quite simply) becomes necessary for the
shell to redirect jos.system.keyboard as needed.  A window manager, of
course, could do the same thing.

	What should the application listen to?  I think it's almost just a
matter of peronsal preference.  It seems, to me anyway, rather odd to be
using a streams idea for an eventspeaker, but it might be worth doing
anyway.  On the other hand, it might be argued that a jos (console)
application should NOT be, by default, event-based, and therefore
inheriting a whole bunch of event-dispatching code in the general case is
a Bad Idea.

	A major factor would be: what other kinds of events might a
console application (usually) be interested in?  timer events?
gained-focus events?  (instead of the signal equivalent of whatever
happens when a job is foregrounded in UNIX)  mouse events?  (would be nice
to have some standardized interface to the mouse for console apps,
wouldn't it?)  the joystick?  If you posit that in a fashion similar to
emacs' x-awareness, console apps might be windowing-aware, you could even
get Menu and Window events.*

	If we believe the Event model is the Right Way To Go for all
applications, shouldn't the event model pretty closely resemble the AWT's?
(or your preferred event model.  I would suggest the AWT's because (a)
it's available and (b) all java programmers should know it.)

	As for difficulty of implementation, does anyone know how
classpath.org is handling event dispatching in their AWT implementation?

* Or, if you posit a 'transparent windowing' shell.  This is an idea
(along with 'command-line windowing' -- more later) I've been thinking
about on and off since the jos project began.  Basically, when one starts
up wash (the windowing application shell), it checks and makes sure
it's running on a graphic console. (or as an xterm-equivalent under the X
equivalent.) If it's not, you can ignore the windowing commands.
Basically, wash uses a text console look-alike VGA framebuffer (for
example), which, as a basic thing, allows for customized fonts (like the
linux virtual consoles do.)  The start-up mode would be definable, but use
an definable-sized font, 80x25 (or definable) at some point (say centered)
in the (black) background of the console.  Taking this a step forward, it
would not be beyond reason to implement a command like '&amp;', say '%': instead of forking
the process off to the background, it forks off a new 'window'.  A wash
'window' would just be another console somewhere else on the screen;
overlaps would be indicated with brighter or darker (etc) text. BUT, no
graphics: wash would be just as fast as a normal shell.  wash would
determine where the keyboard focus is based on ALT-TAB (definable) or
equivalent shortcuts: commands like 'minimize,' 'maximize,' 'tile,'
'cascade,' 'shade,' 'front (process-name)' would do what you might expect
them to do.  Your sysadmin would log in and do something as follows:

jos.org:~# top % $UPPER_RIGHT
jos.org:~# front top
jos.org:~# pine % $LOWER_LEFT
jos.org:~# focus pine
[now in pine's window, which is above the root window but below (probably
 not overlapping) top's window]
[checks his mail and notices that top is claiming the load just
skyrocketed]
[ALT-TAB to the root window]
jos.org:~# kill 1344
jos.org:~# pico /var/log/messages % $FULL_SCREEN
[the FULL_SCREEN 'macro' auto-focuses the newly-spawned window]

and so on.  If the system implements virtual consoles (like Linux) the
become (if they're running wash) virtual desktops.

	It might be fair to call the idea &quot;an all xterm window manager.&quot;
But I would think that window managers manage more xterms than anything
else.  (At least, *I* manage more xterms than other windows this way.)

	Anyway, I think it could be a really neat demonstration.

	Command-line windowing is a very simple idea: does anyone remember
BASIC's and LOGO's mixed-modes?  Where your had four or five lines of text
on the bottom and the graphics up top?  Wouldn't that be a better way to
handle the way most people use window managers than xterms?  (The few
line console, would, of course, have many, many, virtual consoles to play
with.  On a straight memory comparison with Linux, a 5-line screen could
have 30 virtual consoles.)  virtual consoles and virtual desktops would be
independent of each other.  Of course, something like pine might not work
too well on a five-line console, but that's hardly the point.

	These ideas are not in their stable release form.  They no
warranty of any kind, explicit or implied; they have not been tested for
suitability to purpose.  Only load these ideas in a partition of your mind
you can safely erase later; do not use these ideas for mission-critical
applications.  They have not been approved by the FDA.  Usage of the
ideas implies full understanding and agreement with the terms of the
liscence agreement as described by the First Amendment.  Thank you.
