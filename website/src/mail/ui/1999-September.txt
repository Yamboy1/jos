Great!
We can use all the help we can get.  Even if you have no experience in
programming, design is an equally (or more) important aspect of producing
an L&F.  If you have any suggestions on how something should work or look
or behave, share it with the group.  If your talent is art, then we can
definitely use your help.  Whatever help you are willing to give, we will
try to use!

Thanks

Sean

Good, programmers are always in need.  My idea for a JOS L&F is something
like the SAP L&F that is in an article on the Swing Connection.  Maybe a
cross between that and the L&F of the Enlightenment/GNOME window manager
(if you're familiar with it).  Most of all, it should have lots of
configurability, possibly with the ability to texture map or gradient fill
the components.  That's just a few of my ideas.  I won't be able to work
on any of it right away, I'm waiting for parts for my new computer, but
feel free to start.  Obviously, the simplest component UI's to program
will be the Button, ToggleButton, etc.

Later,

Sean

I just read the TGUIGroup Wiki page and realized that people are (better
"were" .. last statement was on Jan99) talking about data formats that
should be used in JOS ...
My opinion about this is that something super-level app should care
about formats not the apps themselves ... propably this could be the job
of JADE ??! ...
It should support as most picture,sound,font,movie (or whatever) formats
as possible ..
a jos app should call a method in jade to load a pic for example and
jade cares about the format and looks up in a table if any
codes/format-loader-classed are available and returns the pic in a java
class ... so apps would be independant of file formats ... like MS who
"invented" the MediaPlayer2 (in fact they reinvented it ! .. the amiga
had a mechanism called Datatypes and through a special library you were
able to load a pic and get a bitmap of it ..)

I would really like to know your opinions about this because it could
make developing really easy ...

firstly I cant see how that would fall to JADE (or even JOS for that
matter--it should be a JOS Library); JADE is after all just a liaison
between the user and the OS...

JMF (JavaMediaFramework) has something like this (for media only), JAF
(JActivationF) has something kinda like this but for a different use
(but I think it should be from the same place...) and I tried tackling
this problem myself (with an uberversion of the HotJava content
handlers) although I eventually moved on, I could send what I did to you
if you want.

Cheers,
DigiGod

I just though about it .. but if it will not be part of JADE (which i can
accept :) )...
we should think about writing a kind of datatype library which loads different
file types and returns just a bitmap/text/whatever to the app. it think this
is th best way to handle the file type chaos ...

i'd really like to see it but i can't promise that i'll have enough time to
read it that intesitively ...

but tell me if the idea of a datatype library (class) would be good or is
there enough support in the java apis ?!

this is kinda what I was working on, except it wraps it in a quasibean
created for each type...

you could get by with the java apis, but technically you could survive
in the sierra with a poncho and a coffee can (Im saying Id rather not
:). they don't offer as eloquent a solution as Id like.

file (its not what one would describe as "finished" or "runnable" but
its better then nothing I guess ;)

Subject: [JOS-UI] JOS Look and Feel ...

Hi ..
i started to code a look & feel for jos (or just for java) ...
if you like the idea we could use it as the default look and feel for
jos. it will be customizable in many ways like border type, fore- and
background image or color, font style and color, definable keys a.s.o.
it is in many ways like the MagicUserInterface ( www.sasg.de .. but
could be wrong) on the Amiga ...
it is in pre-pre-alpha stage because only ButtonUI is implemented yet
but it works even with SwingSet ... if anybody is interested in the
latest source feel free to mail me and i will send it to you ...

Package org.jos.ui.plaf.paranoia
                |- ParanoiaLookAndFeel.class             // LookAndFeel
class extends BasicLookAndFeel
                |- ParanoiaButtonUI.class                    // ButtonUI
mapped over the basic one
                |- .border
                    |- XenBorder.class                           // XEN
style border
                    |- PlainBorder.class                          //
Plain (one-colored) border
                    |- BeveledBorder.class                     //
Beveled (simple-3D) border

toDo:
  - add lots of border styles (i have ideas for 7 other styles)
  - implement UIClasses for mapping (total of 40 classes, 1 is nearly
done)
  - write configuration application
additional work :
  - write Datatypes-style.class that supports to load/save as much
fileformats as possible
  - design some themes (color and style)

any help is welcome ... probably i will be willing to lead a new project
in jos ...

Sounds good.  I'd like to work on some of it...that is, when I get my new
computer in.  Send me some code when you have a chance.

first of all this is great, we need more stuff like this (even if you
don't make it part of JOS it aids the Java community in general).

 sounds like a separate project... but, why not use the registry?

I don't have alot of time to invest in this but I'll do anything I can,
I'm sure that goes for all of us. 

Keep the list updated of your progress, no matter how busy we get we can
always donate advice to a project.

DigiGod

Fine thanks ..

Using the registry will make it jos dependent or am i wrong ?

Doesn't matter ... I think i'll create a new page on the wiki for this Project
but i am not sure if the wiki works again ... still can't get into the
