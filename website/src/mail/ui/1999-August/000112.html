Yes. And by that I mean both and neither; to make it less confusing I'll
explain the whole thing.

The UI is not--technically speaking--part of the OS, its an application.
The application/UI we are designing is called JADE
(JavaApplication&amp;DesktopEnvironment) it is a socket, so to speak, for
the actual UI. JADE consists of a minimal framework that the actual UI
plugs into. It also has convience framework extensions* for CLI's
(CommandLineInterfaces, or a &quot;dos ui&quot;) and for TGUI's (TraditionalGUI
aka a &quot;windows gui&quot;). This way the user can select the best UI for
his/her skill-level/requirments/tastes. Id est, someone who only does
word proccessing could have a UI that is &quot;docucentric&quot; (or
document-oriented) while someone who is familiar with macintoshes could
have a MAC UI while a server admin can put in a UNIX like CLI...

Cheers,
DigiGod

*/framework extension/ is actually a plug to JADE's socket
  that acts as a plug itself, thus becoming a kind of 
  &quot;extending proxy&quot;.

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
