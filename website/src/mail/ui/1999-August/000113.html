JOS has a unique architecture. The &quot;user interface&quot; for JOS is an optional
plug-in. Like a salad bar, you can have anything you want. While some
operating systems are built upon the premise of one-size-fits-all, JOS is
open-ended and gives you choice. What user interface do you want to use
this time? No problem.

JOS will support the graphical user interface for everyone who wants one,
through video drivers, JADE, and plug-in window managers. JOS is equally at
home on a desktop PC as it is on a serverfarm in a closet, with no monitor,
no video graphics card, no mouse, no keyboard.

JOS builds on the strength of Java's interfaces to make many seemingly
incompatible presentation managers work well together. With multiple domain
support, it provides a mechanism to switch among domains. Each domain can
have a character-based or bitmapped user interface.

Well, that's the plan. There are special interests groups working on each
user interface. They're all here on the JOS-UI discussion.
