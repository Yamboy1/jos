no, no this isnt what I meant at all. I was reffereing to the windows on
the desktop.

the Model is a collection of rectangles each with a z-order the
&quot;screens&quot; rectangle being a constant last. each window on the desktop is
represented as a rectangle.

the controller is implementation specefic in this case, AWT (which Im
betting would be 99.99% all cases, if not more) it mediates between the
view (the desktop) and the &quot;genderless&quot; model (the rectangles),
translateing the Windows.

the desktop draws itself according to the commands of the controller
which is a translator for the model. (of course the desktop also has to
handle drawing the background and the icons and the screensaver if your
inactive long enough)

I see the benifit not being to us but to those who can use the same
Model since they need, for X reason, to use a different set of
components then AWT. And both the model and controller (and possibly
even the view if done properly) can be reused by the standard Swing/AWT
TGUI's

PagerWidget is a good widget but not to be included in JADE, we decided
awhile ago that a UI/extension to JADE was to be provided that handled
virtual desktops by proxing itself (in the guise of a PUI) between JADE
and the real UI's. the coolest benifit of this being the ability (if
done properly) to plug in X different UI's (assuming support for all) in
the vw's

win95 style context menus would implememnt MenuWidget's too, as would
the menubar thingy on macs (which would also be a toolbar since its
attached to the desktop btw (what is that thing called again?)).

system menu, here here. start menu? start what? at least when you call
it system menu people know what your talking about.

Cheers,
DigiGod
