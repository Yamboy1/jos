<PRE>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well in JOS it wont matter since it will be the default toolkit for one
</I>&gt;<i> thing.
</I>
Yes, but it would be good to be able to test it!

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> also Id like to say this is part of JADE, and should be in something
</I>&gt;<i> like org.jos.experimental.seancribbs.ui.jade.awt.JOSToolkit.
</I>
OK, whatever.  In my opinion, the package location is trivial at this
point.  That's the easiest thing to change, and can be done on a
moment's notice.  Since I'm not posting on CVS or SourceServer, why does
it matter right now?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> cant component, container, frame and all that just be lightweight and
</I>&gt;<i> have all the graphics stuff in Window?(since thats where it all comes
</I>&gt;<i> from) and that just use the Screen (or whatever).
</I>
Well, I figured that because Window and Frame are similar in standard
AWT, then if one is lightweight, both should be.  Besides, it's not good
practice to make each component or container a Window.  You set yourself
up for circular references because the AWT hierarchy specifies that
Window is a Container.  IMO, component and container are the only
heavyweight peers needed.  In looking at the API, apparently Container
has no peer of its own.  The ContainerPeer interface is only so a base
class can be provided for Panel, Window and their descendents.  The
Container class uses a ComponentPeer, which means that lightweight
containers handle all their containees themselves.  Therefore we only
need to override ComponentPeer and LightweightPeer to interface with the
graphics guts.

Later,

Sean
