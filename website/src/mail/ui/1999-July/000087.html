<PRE>I use widget in a broad sense not tied to either the AWT or Swing.

JADE's widgets should be defined in this broad sense, hence we should
define them first as interfaces create a default set using swing then
extends that to create the &quot;JOS Standard GUI&quot; widgets.

here's all the widgets I can think of

Widget
 |
 +-DesktopWidget
 |
 +-ClockWidget
 |
 +-DockWidget
 |
 +-TaskbarWidget
 |
 +-ToolbarWidget
 |
 +-PropertyPageWidget

Widget is the super interface (it doesnt even have to define any
methods).

DesktopWidget represents the actual desktop and has methods for moving
windows around, adding widgets (like a taskbar) and the like. I see the
class DesktopScreen (extends Screen implements DesktopWidget) being the
default desktop, as extensible and flexible as possible, and using the
default AWT/Swing component model. it would be rare that a different
Desktop would be used (except in the case of no Desktop or a text
desktop for a TUI)

ClockWidget is the system clock with date and time, better name? anyone?

DockWidget is a systemtrayish beandock like we talked about, it accepts
classes implementing Dockable

TaskbarWidget is the taskbar

ToolbarWidget is a toolbar for the desktop, with docking (&amp;locking) to
the sides

PropertyPageWidget is like a &quot;control panel&quot; (in windows it would
encapsulate all the tabs accesed via Properties... in a context menu)
this would most likely be implemented as TabbedPanes but it shouldnt be
required to use it (1 tab looks silly, and if you have enough to create
two rows of panes you should use a JList holding the titles instead)

the standard windows9x taskbar would be implemented via a JWindow that
implements ToolbarWidget and TaskbarWidget (or more likely extends
SimpleToolbarWidget (our swing generic implementation) and implements
TaskbarWidget) and would contain a button/menu for the start menu, the
system tray would be a JPanel that implements ClockWidget and DockWidget
(rhyming unintentional)

The mac pulldown menu thing (I dont remember what its called) would be a
JMenuBar implementing ToolbarWidget (so it could plater itself on to the
desktop like that, it would return false for hideable and draggable (or
not implement those interfaces?))

the discussion to follow should include A) what widgets to include (and
what to name them) and B) what methods to put in them and how it would
be supported in JADE.

everything else (providing the &quot;SimpleXXXWidget&quot;'s) can wait until we
have this framework setup

Cheers,
DigiGod

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
