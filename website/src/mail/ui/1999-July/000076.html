A CLI isnt going to have a taskbar, a XUI might not. JADE cant assume
there is a taskbar, if there was a taskbar its only interaction would be
that it uses JADE to get things like the process manager (to create the
list of tasks) so a taskbar is part of the UI and is part of a JADE
plug-UI but is not part of the core JADE its self. also, what if system
y doesnt have Swing? it would need an AWT taskbar. the answer is all the
desktop widgets must be designed via interface.

public interface Taskbar extends DesktopWidget {
 //bla bla bla
}

Defaults for building the &quot;default JOS UI&quot; will be implemented in Swing
of course. the best part is a single component could take on more then
one widget function like: &quot;X implements TaskBar, Clock&quot;.

infact we should make (abstract?) Swing components of more general use
then extend them for the default UI

JOSTaskBar extends GeneralTaskBar

well I dont have any xp with GNOME but Id like something like the system
tray but better and more configurable allright...

Cheers,
