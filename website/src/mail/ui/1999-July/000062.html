</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO, Java is much to immature for you to expect it to last unchanged
</I>&gt;<i> in its current form.  It's going to continue to change in
</I>&gt;<i> non-compatible ways for many more years as people uncover problems and
</I>&gt;<i> generate fixes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Look at any other programming language and you will see similar changes
</I>&gt;<i> during its formative years... Even a relatively mature language like
</I>&gt;<i> C++ just became standardized and many implementations still need to
</I>&gt;<i> change (in non-compatible ways) to support the standard.  And let's not
</I>&gt;<i> even start with other languages like fortran that have gone through
</I>&gt;<i> MAJOR changes to stay alive.  If java were to not evolve (and radically
</I>&gt;<i> so in the beginning) it would remain immature and practically useless.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, as you point out, Java is more than just a language, its a
</I>&gt;<i> platform.  So in many ways you must treat it like an operating system.
</I>&gt;<i> No one expects OS's to stay 100% backward compatible between versions.
</I>&gt;<i> And I've yet to see any OS that thought it was so well designed that it
</I>&gt;<i> didn't need to make changes that breaks some or all old programs
</I>&gt;<i> between versions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would full expect the first full rev of the JVM (when the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation goes from 1.x to 2.0) to actually change the VM spec.
</I>&gt;<i> using experience gained with the current VM.  Probably something to use
</I>&gt;<i> some of those undefined byte codes for optimization or as an escape to
</I>&gt;<i> another byte code set for efficiency/speed/etc or introducing some
</I>&gt;<i> general purpose &quot;registers&quot;...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO, Java is still very bleeding edge and you need to expect the
</I>&gt;<i> ground to constantly shift under you at a moment's notice... If you
</I>&gt;<i> like stability, you should probably stick with a more mature technology
</I>&gt;<i> like C on unix where changes are much more incremental.  This is
</I>&gt;<i> definitely not to say that I don't want you working on JOS.  I just
</I>&gt;<i> think your expectations of the technology are a bit high.

I agree.  I also think that while this discussion has its place, we
should concentrate on design and development.  Bashing and flaming don't
get us anywhere.  Besides, this list is about UI details.  The
discussion above might be more appropriate on the general discussion
list.
