exactly, although I think window is the only one that should have to talk to the graphics device directly, the way AWT/Swing draws that would be the only thing nessecary. also, and Ive said it before,
we should have swappable titlebars (that is a Swing FrameComponentUI) in our quasicomponent/peer for the frame class (since not all plafs would support this we should have it change to the default
(that is JOS) L&amp;F's titlebar so you dont have something like a window titlebar on a mac window (because you know they'd just get into a fight)).

But maybe the window quasicomponent/peer shouldnt talk directly to the graphics device but instead to a handy abstraction called Screen, this would encaps. the Screen (duh), provide stuff like the
colorModel and screensize to the toolkit. it could handle stuff like window drawing (all that boring redraw crap no one wants to do) via a &quot;default&quot; child (DesktopScreen?). And as I said before the
screensaver would be passed this directly so it could play with the desktop.

Another point of buisness, all this stuff is lowlevel JADE (if you dont know what Im talking about see JADE on the Wiki) and JADE, being the UI, isnt really part of the OS so should it be in org.jos?
I dont think so, org.jade would be more appropriate since it is a JOS-only app and it would be a pretty big, no point getting it all mixed up with JOS (its easier for everyone this way)

Cheers,
