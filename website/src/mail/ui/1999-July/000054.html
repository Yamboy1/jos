you have a point, I agree.

as for a final destination I think we should have an org.jos.jade
package and it be in the subpackage awt (org.jos.jade.awt).
 
&gt;<i> So what if peer_ui uses jade. Since my application uses java.io, should I
</I>&gt;<i> put it inside java.io.myapp? What if my application uses both java.io and
</I>&gt;<i> java.net? How to I put my app in both java.io.myapp and java.net.myapp?
</I>
It doesn't use jade, its part of jade (IMO at least). I think we need to
have a sepereation between UI and OS, a UI is just an app used to
communicate with the OS.
 
&gt;<i> The longest JOS-related package on my computer is called
</I>&gt;<i> com.realignsoft.masterregistry1a.io.test, just 5 packages deep. I can find
</I>&gt;<i> no justification to make any package deeper than that. It's more trouble
</I>&gt;<i> than it's worth. It just gets in the way. Every time I make deeper packages
</I>&gt;<i> I end up in deep trouble.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After a package is built, has been fully tested, and everybody likes it,
</I>&gt;<i> you might consider finding a place for it inside the jos or org.jos
</I>&gt;<i> namespace. And, you have to be conservative even then.
</I>
Your right, we should wait till we have something solid to put in our,
proverbial, basket.

Cheers,

	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
