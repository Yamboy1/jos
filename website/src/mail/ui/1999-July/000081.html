<PRE>Ive been working on the SSDK (ScreenSaverDevelopmentKit) as I worked on
it I realized I had to make some changes to ScreenSaver (better now then
later) but anyway it consists of:

ScreenSaver                       (abstract)
ScreenSaverUser                   (interface)
SwingScreenSaverUser
PreviewScreenSaver
PreviewScreenSaver.PreviewWindow
JADEScreenSaverConfigurationPanel (name-may-change)

ScreenSaver is the class ScreenSaver's extends from, all they need to
implement is init and paint, but it can greatly extend its
functionality.

ScreenSaverUser is an interface defining a class that uses a
screensaver, it has one method void setScreenSaver(ScreenSaver ss); both
SwingScreenSaverUser and PreviewScreenSaver implement it.

SwingScreenSaverUser is a JComponent that renders the ScreenSaver in its
graphics (needs work)

PreviewScreenSaver is an app that previews a ScreenSaver in a full
screen window (its inner class)

JADEScreenSaverConfigurationPanel is a JPanel that has a list of
screensavers to select from, it uses a small SwingScreenSaverUser to
show a basic idea of it and has a preview button that opens a
PreviewScreenSaver (as it is designed so it doesnt have to run as an app
only)

the SSDK cant be considered &quot;done&quot; until I have a strong registry to
implement the list of available screensavers, it also needs it to make
the configuration persist (Id rather not have it persist then do a
workaround to un workaround later) 

the JADEScreenSaverConfigurationPanel needs a way to tell Jade to use
this screensaver after x minutes, I assume it will also eventually
extend something else like PropertyPage (something else Im working on)

I will only consider this version .5 until I get the registry and then
only .9, having the screensaver being set makes it version 1

Cheers,
DigiGod

	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
