</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For those who missed the discussion way back then, I think we decided on

</I>&gt;<i> implemented displays or user interfaces of those data structures.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, there may be a view that displays the list of open windows
</I>&gt;<i> - the user could click on a window item to raise that window on the
</I>&gt;<i> desktop (yes, like that significant component of the taskbar). There
</I>&gt;<i> could be another &quot;view&quot; of the same window list &quot;model&quot; that shows your
</I>&gt;<i> miniature virtual desktops. This view would mirror the exact window
</I>&gt;<i> positions of each window on a smaller scale but allow you to select
</I>&gt;<i> windows in the same way as the taskbar. The most interesting view is
</I>&gt;<i> actually the window manager itself. It should also be a view of the
</I>&gt;<i> window list.
</I>
we also decided that virtual windows would be handled by a special JADE
PUI that allows other UI's to plug into it (I know what your saying but
I wanted to remind us)

say the DesktopScreen (extends Screen extends OutputDevice?) has an
inner class WindowManager which does all that nasty window overlap code
(gracefully, of course) this would be the 'M', the TaskbarWidget
(TaskbarController?) would be the 'C' and whatever component implements
that would be the 'V'
 
&gt;<i> &quot;Window list&quot; is not necessarily the best way to divide the model space
</I>&gt;<i> but it is enough to demonstrate the concept.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the answer is all the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; desktop widgets must be designed via interface.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; public interface Taskbar extends DesktopWidget {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  //bla bla bla
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This corresponds to a view. I have no objection to the term &quot;widget&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> but you should also think up a term that corresponds to &quot;model&quot;. I know
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't mentioned &quot;controller&quot; yet. Typically a controller is
</I>&gt;<i> responsible for handling a use case in a system. Swing uses a modified
</I>&gt;<i> MVC model where the controller is combined with the view. The argument
</I>&gt;<i> is that creating a separate controller class for everything can be an
</I>&gt;<i> overkill. This is probably the way to go unless we can foresee a
</I>&gt;<i> specific need to have controllers separate.
</I>
so we leave the M up to the OS/JADE to be reperesented as best they can
and put the VC into the widgets (or whatever)?
