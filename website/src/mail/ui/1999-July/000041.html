<PRE>excerpt from
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/2d/spec/j2d-bookTOC.doc.html">http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/2d/spec/j2d-bookTOC.doc.html</A>

     The Java 2D API defines three levels of configuration information
that are maintained to support the conversion from
     user space to device space. This information is encapsulated by
three classes:

          GraphicsEnvironment 
          GraphicsDevice 
          GraphicsConfiguration 

     The GraphicsEnvironment describes the collection of rendering
devices visible to a Java application on a
     particular platform. Rendering devices include screens, printers,
and image buffers. The GraphicsEnvironment
     also includes a lis t of all of the available fonts on the
platform. 

     A GraphicsDevice describes an application-visible rendering device,
such as a screen or printer. Each possible
     configuration of the device is represented by a
GraphicsConfiguration. For example, an SVGA display device
     can operate in several modes: 640x480x16 colors, 640x480x256
colors, and 800x600x256 colors. The SVGA screen is
     represented by a GraphicsDevice object and each of the modes is
represented by a GraphicsConfiguration
     object.

     A GraphicsEnvironment can contain one or more GraphicsDevices; in
turn, each GraphicsDevice can have
     one or more GraphicsConfigurations.

     Between them, the GraphicsEnvironment, GraphicsDevice, and
GraphicsConfiguration represent all of
     the information necessary for locating a rendering device or font
on the Java platform and for converting coordinates
     from u ser space to device space. An application can access this
information, but does not need to perform any
     transformations between user space and device space. 


---

these classes describe the graphics equpiment and scuh, Screen would be
an abstraction of only the screen for the purpose of containging the
desktop.

more on this after I finish reading.

Cheers,

Quote of the Moment:
        Thus spake the master Ninjei:

          one whip, to the well-written program, a single
          command&quot;

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
