worth worrying about, but on JOS general mailing list please

&gt;<i> Actually, you sound quite keen. Why don't you come up with a proposal?

Gilbert, he is quite correct. maybe you could get JDK 2.0 (or Java 3 or
Java:the next genertation, or whatever Sun decided to call the bloody
thing) to only put the essentials in the java package and the rest in
javax where it should be, maybe you could even talk them into
multiprocess VM's.

But please from now on discuss this is on the JOS general mailing list,
I dont want to remove anyone. last thing I want to be is censor morum
people; this is the *last* warning.

Cheers,
DigiGod

	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
