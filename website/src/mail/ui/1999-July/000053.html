SwingToolkit isn't exactly a 100% pure Java application. The sort of
task SwingToolkit is designed to do requires a lot of trickery and you
can't expect it to work when Sun makes the slightest change to its
libraries. This is the sort of software that needs to be updated
frequently to be compatible with new JVMs. Any code that is close to the
core of JOS is likely to have this same attribute.

I don't expect that standard JOS applications will run into the same
problems. I have certainly not encountered any problems.

No. Write Once means that if you write an application against Swing
1.02, it will run on any Java platform that has Swing 1.02 without
having to rewrite it. If a Java platform has Swing 1.1, your application
needs to be upgraded to work with the new Swing. It is possible to have
both versions of Swing installed on your computer and run different
applications against different versions of swing as necessary.

Having two versions of the JDK installed is another thing, though, and
could be difficult to handle in JOS. Luckily, JDK 1.2 is largely
backward compatible with JDK 1.1. One obvious difference is in the
threads API but Java developers have had sufficient warning to stop
calling stop() that there are unlikely to be many problems when
upgrading to JDK 1.2.
