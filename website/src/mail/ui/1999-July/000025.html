If I've learned one thing its that you never need an opportunity to
disagree :)

&gt;<i> JADE should go directly into

JADE will probably interface directly to org.jos.core.*, does that mean
it /has/ to be in org.jos.ui.jade.*? 
I wrote a program that used javax.swing.*, does that mean I have to put
it in javax.swing.myapp.*? JADE will be an integral part of JOS'es
succes, but I think the ability for it to be /not/ part of JOS is just
as important. it is an application, an ambassador between the human the
computer, one that can change shape to best communicate. if JOS were
running off the onboard of a small robot in someones basement it wouldnt
need JADE, JADE would be a hinderance, adding extra weight to its
fragile alluminum legs. this same robot might have a remote connection
to jon q. hackers PC, which does have JADE and a small app for sending
data to the robot, that would be the best way to communicate in this
case. Thats why we want JADE to be flexible, so we can have the best way
to communicate with JOS at all times, part of realizing that is
realizing sometimes the best way is without JADE.

Cheers,
DigiGod

	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
