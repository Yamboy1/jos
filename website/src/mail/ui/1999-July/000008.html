I've spent some time inside it, yes. (mostly trying to figure out why what I was trying to wasn't working, obscenities may have been involved) And after I fwd'ed that message to the mailing list I
thought of another idea that may be more feasible: creating AWT peers that use the componentUI classes directly, replacing the M instead of the VC for once; what I know of Swing and AWT make this seem
like a good idea, but I've been wrong before.

Cheers,
DigiGod

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
