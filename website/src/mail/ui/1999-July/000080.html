b) Ive realized this and have changed the class
 
&gt;<i> If you extend Window, you will inherit a similar method. It may sound
</I>&gt;<i> like I'm suggesting that you extend Window. I don't actually mind. You

ScreenSaver only extends Object, its not a component

Im writing another e-mail about my update to the SSDK, just wait about 5
minute... 

Cheers,

	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
