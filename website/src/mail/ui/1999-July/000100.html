i did not mean JOS should not have a CLI but it should be implemented in
a
graphic environment
but i accept the fact that they are easier to create.

again i just meant that this gives you a startup configuration .. i
_hope_
that driver implementation is realtime ;)

exactly what i thought of ;)

</I>&gt;<i> JADE is for UIs what OO is for imperative programming -- hiding all

&gt;<i> work behind a nice interface, and making it reusable.
</I>
i agree in this concept ... it should be easy to port to other platforms
(not
just x86)

all in one it was just an idea and i wanted you all to know about it ...

i would really like to join you work but i think that i dont know enough
to
help you much but i start learning ;)
(first thing is to get cvs running to download the source ...)
