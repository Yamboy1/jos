it is trivial at this point but we might as well get used to doing it
this way, just as a good practice. the experimental.wikiname part is the
most important part IMO.

&gt;<i> &gt; cant component, container, frame and all that just be lightweight and

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I figured that because Window and Frame are similar in standard
</I>&gt;<i> AWT, then if one is lightweight, both should be.  Besides, it's not good
</I>&gt;<i> practice to make each component or container a Window.  You set yourself
</I>&gt;<i> up for circular references because the AWT hierarchy specifies that
</I>&gt;<i> Window is a Container.  IMO, component and container are the only
</I>&gt;<i> heavyweight peers needed.  In looking at the API, apparently Container
</I>&gt;<i> has no peer of its own.  The ContainerPeer interface is only so a base
</I>&gt;<i> class can be provided for Panel, Window and their descendents.  The
</I>&gt;<i> Container class uses a ComponentPeer, which means that lightweight
</I>&gt;<i> containers handle all their containees themselves.  Therefore we only
</I>&gt;<i> need to override ComponentPeer and LightweightPeer to interface with the
</I>&gt;<i> graphics guts.
</I>
Technically Window would be lightweight in that scenario to, its kinda
impossible to have a traditional heavyweight component the way were
doing it. But I meant the Window should be the only one that interfaces
to the screen since everything else either has to go into it
(Components, Container...) or descends from it (Frame).

Postscript: I had a problem with your src jar file, some download error;
can I have the URL again?

Cheers,

	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
