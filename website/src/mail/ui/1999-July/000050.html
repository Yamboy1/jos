When I first read this, I laughed out loud. That's probably the most
rediculous package name I ever did see. I thought for sure it was a _joke_. :)

And then, Sean seems to have take this seriously. Don't do it. Please don't
use such a convoluted and irrelevant package name. And, it is important for
the community to find the right package name as soon as possible.

Since Sean is working on it and we're not quite sure where it fits in the
org.jos packages, you might call it seancribbs.peer_ui for now. Sean, if
you own your own Internet domain, you might call it yourdomain.peer_ui for
now. But don't put it in the org.jos packages. And certainly don't put it
inside the entirely redudant experimental package.

So what if peer_ui uses jade. Since my application uses java.io, should I
put it inside java.io.myapp? What if my application uses both java.io and
java.net? How to I put my app in both java.io.myapp and java.net.myapp?

The longest JOS-related package on my computer is called
com.realignsoft.masterregistry1a.io.test, just 5 packages deep. I can find
no justification to make any package deeper than that. It's more trouble
than it's worth. It just gets in the way. Every time I make deeper packages
I end up in deep trouble.

After a package is built, has been fully tested, and everybody likes it,
you might consider finding a place for it inside the jos or org.jos
namespace. And, you have to be conservative even then.
