<PRE>&gt;<i> I think making the desktop a JDesktopPane is the worst way to go, it
</I>&gt;<i> requires to many messy hacks to work could cause problems with AWT
</I>&gt;<i> components and is somewhat small minded design wise. several times Ive
</I>&gt;<i> proposed the use of a Screen.
</I>
Actually, after messing with my peer-toolkit hack for long enough, I'm
inclined to agree.  Mixing AWT and Swing is just too messy.  Of course,
that doesn't mean we have to forgo having PL&amp;F in standard AWT.  I think
using the Swing UI delegates directly won't work, because one way or
another they require a JComponent (and probably typecast to whatever
subclass they are working with).  Instead, I'm going to investigate
making the L&amp;F pluggable at the peer level.  Since our peers will never
make graphics calls directly through native libraries, but instead
through some Screen or GraphicsDevice object, our system is essentially
lightweight.  I think I will botch my old code and start some new stuff,
mimicing Swing's idea of the UIManager-JComponent connection in the
Toolkit-Peer connection.  Unfortunately, this means that the AWT L&amp;F
will be separate from and independent of the Swing L&amp;F, but I see no
reason why we can't create AWT L&amp;F's that look like the Swing versions. 
Then, hypothetically, a user selecting a particular look and feel could
have the two L&amp;F's changed in tandem.  Anyway, those are my ideas for
now.

Later,

Sean Cribbs
