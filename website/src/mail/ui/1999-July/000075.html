I agree.  In my opinion a &quot;taskbar&quot; could mean anything from the Win95
style taskbar, to Apple's Finder, to the CDE Desktop/application bar to
the AfterStep docking/menu bar.  What I mean is a desktop-level widget
that provides convenient ways to launch applications, switch between
virtual desktops, change UI settings, etc.; this widget would be a
central control for navigating and managing the UI.  As far as keeping
track of which tasks are running, it could simply create a new entry for
each application launched from one of its menus or a Run box.

The reason why I think it should be a bean container is so that
applications can &quot;dock&quot; like in the GNOME desktop, or minimize to the
system tray, like in Windows (although I prefer the former).  This way,
applications that do things like display the system clock, play audio or
CDs, download files, etc. can make themselves both accessible and
unobtrusive.
