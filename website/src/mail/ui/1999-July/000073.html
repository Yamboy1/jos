Point taken (re: JADE/GC).  The reason why I thought the screen saver
should be a bean is so that it could be imbedded in an application or
taskbar and invoked at will.  Perhaps this is not such a great idea. 
Maybe instead, we can have a bean that provides that functionality, but
not necessarily the screen saver be one.  A well defined interface is
good enough for me!

Do you mean you have a taskbar in development, or that you were going to
test the screen saver?

&gt;<i> &gt; I think I'll follow your footsteps and name the tookit-peer package

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> dont thank me, it was &lt;URL:Wiki:GilbertHerschberger&gt;'s idea.

Will do!

Later,
