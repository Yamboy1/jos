A bean to run the screensaver would be nice I guess, although Id think
the AWT thread for JADE after detecting X minutes of 0-activity tells
JADE to run the scrensaver (if ones set) at which point it handles all
that. a bean would just be an animation using the screensaver as the
painter... hmm, in windows you have that little monitor where you see
the screensaver running in the config dialog I could make a bean that
could be used in our screensaver config pane... (and as the runner for
the testbox (below))

JADE would give the screensaver the entire screen after telling the
other apps to take a rest (not sure how but it would have to do it so
they couldnt paint anymore, possibly take a snap shot of the screen for
the saver to use and set the GC the apps use to an offscreen buffer so
they could continue updating while the screensaver is running...) and
the AWTThread's output would be entirely for JADE and on any activity
the screensaver is shutdown and everythings set back to normal

</I>&gt;<i> test the screen saver?
</I>
I mean Im going to make a testbox for the screensaver (I'd have done it
by now but I was working on something else).

as far as a taskbar goes thats a bit of a tricky subject, I mean a) we'd
need a way of knowing what tasks there are b) it cant be the only way to
do it (some UI's might not have one) c) what constitutes a TaskBar? do
we include a clock/systemtray thing or is that separate (it should be)?
how do we show the association, beancontext?

we'll need to discuss the general idea of how JADE is going to handle
&quot;standard&quot; components for the TGUI first

Cheers,
DigiGod
