Hi Sean. When I wrote SwingToolkit, JDK 1.2 was not available for Linux.
And I'm not surprised that it doesn't work considering that it is
incomplete. I really just got it to the stage where I demonstrated that
such a thing could be done, and hoped that other people would finish it.
It's good to see you're aiming to go all the way.

As Regier pointed out, I have solved some of the initialization problems
associated with Toolkits. The README file explains the approach I've
taken. Feel free to take a look.

I will have to read the list archives to get up to speed on this
discussion (I fell off the gui list when we changed list servers, and
I've just rejoined). I will take a look at your source code some time.

There is another Swing based window manager out there called Shark
(available on <A HREF="http://www.gjt.org/">http://www.gjt.org/</A>). The author has also written his own
native Graphics class to draw directly to the screen rather than reusing
java.awt.Window.
