we could have a very abstract model, it doesnt even need to be aware of
the components its using, we could represent them as Rectangles to it.
all it would have is a view rectangle (the screen) and a stack of
rectangles that it was in charge of z-ordering and the like. the
controller would handle conversion between windows and rectangles and
the view (DesktopScreen) would render accordingly.

this could be reused by many things, even a UI that doesnt use AWT or
Swing to do windowing (for whatever reason). which bring up something
Ive been wondering about it is possible to make text peers for the AWT
but it translates badly, it could be possible for us to design our own
TWT (think about it) for TUI's, it could extend our classes for basic
CLI stuff. is that good or bad though? (eitherway it should be packaged
outside of JADE org.jos.twt)

oh, there should also be a maximize/restore thing in the wherever that
would go since it is different to the OS then having it resized to
screen size and placed so it covers everything.

&gt;<i> There is probably very little you can decide about the view interfaces
</I>&gt;<i> at this point in time. When you start to consider how the controllers
</I>&gt;<i> and models come in to play, your design will probably change completely.
</I>&gt;<i> I definately think it is easier to start designing from the model end.
</I>&gt;<i> Even then, your design will change a bit when you start to consider how
</I>&gt;<i> the view fits into the picture. But at least when you get there, you

</I>
you may be right, but we could at least get a basic idea of what we need
to put them in, but more importantly (and Ive tried to stress this) of
which ones to include that list I gave was far from complete, and some
of them should have different, more appropriate, names.

we have all sorts of people who have used allsorts of UI's, we can think
of more widgets as part of our ADW package (abstract desktop widgets?
org.jade.adw and the swing ones in org.jade.adw.simple)

Cheers,
