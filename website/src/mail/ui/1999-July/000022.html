I don't know if you can apply a smart factory to /everything/ it has its place in many things but I think this area is to abstract for it and would just make it harder to make good UI's (its way to
easy to create bad ones already)

There are a few behind the scenes places it could be used in the lower level stuff Id imagine, and if their is it will be used. design is about picking the best pattern for the job, not your favorite
(my favorite happens to be the &quot;you do it, I'll watch&quot; pattern :)

Cheers,

	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial

	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
