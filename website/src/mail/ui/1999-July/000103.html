I don't see where the worry you have comes from.  A registry-based
configuration system, if well designed, is amenable to beginning users
as well as advanced ones.  Beginning users will like the pretty user
interfaces for configuring their devices and other system components. 
Advanced users will appreciate that the registry is well organized and
complete.  Even Windows, which largely uses a registry, still holds onto
INI files and the like.  Linux (and other versions of UNIX), which has
no central registry, is even worse, spreading its configuration over
multiple files and directories.  JOS will probably be initially aimed at
power users, but as the included tools and features mature, it will be
easily scalable to a novice.
