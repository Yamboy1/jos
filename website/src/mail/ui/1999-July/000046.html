<PRE>&gt;<i> it is trivial at this point but we might as well get used to doing it
</I>&gt;<i> this way, just as a good practice. the experimental.wikiname part is the
</I>&gt;<i> most important part IMO.
</I>
OK.  I'll put it on the todo list.

&gt;<i> Technically Window would be lightweight in that scenario to, its kinda
</I>&gt;<i> impossible to have a traditional heavyweight component the way were
</I>&gt;<i> doing it. But I meant the Window should be the only one that interfaces
</I>&gt;<i> to the screen since everything else either has to go into it
</I>&gt;<i> (Components, Container...) or descends from it (Frame).
</I>
OK, I see what you mean.  But maybe we could just create some
Toolkit-level entity that does the work of a traditional heavyweight
window.  Right now, we have to have a heavyweight window to hold the
top-level JDesktopPane, but maybe in the future a JOSDesktop or
something of the sort could do the work of the current kludge.
 
&gt;<i> Postscript: I had a problem with your src jar file, some download error;
</I>&gt;<i> can I have the URL again?
</I>
Yes.  <A HREF="http://www.ens.utulsa.edu/~scribbs/jostkpeers.jar">http://www.ens.utulsa.edu/~scribbs/jostkpeers.jar</A>

If you still have problems, tell me and I can get you the source in some
other format.

Later,

Sean
