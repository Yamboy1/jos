If by that you mean we have an API hammered out AND written AND compiled
AND tested. um, no. it seems everybodys waiting for something else,
something else thats waiting for something else also, generally. If you
have any proposals fire away, and Im going to use one of my favorite
paraphrases here &quot;I could be wrong, but it would still be progress&quot;; I'd
like everyone to remember that.

Cheers,

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
