well I dont know about memory use and event handling but from my
experience with Swing I think that it would handle the L&amp;F problem but I
dont know if its the best way per se

</I>&gt;<i> JOS-based look and feel, the old values won't change.  Maybe this is
</I>&gt;<i> desirable or undesirable behavior, I'm not sure.

Im sure most users would consider this a bug and a &quot;turn off&quot; the power
users would have long worked around it but there not the ones we need to
make this a success in the classic definition

Cheers,

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
