<PRE>Malini -

I just recently joined JOS, although I had followed it for a while
before joining.

I guess the first thing to do is set some goals for the project, so
here's my ideas:

The overall goal is to create a Pluggable Look and Feel for JOS.  This
is basically a 
set of Java classes that define the appearance and behavior of
Swing-style GUI widgets.

Subgoals:
1) The PL&amp;F should be configurable using themes, i.e. color themes,
sound themes,
   behavior themes, whatever we can come up with.  We might also provide
some mini-
   applications that allow the user to configure these themes.

2) Make the appearance and behavior distinctively JOS, but incorporate
behaviors from 
   other UIs that we like and disclude &quot;features&quot; that we dislike.  For
example, I 
   like the appearance of a Windows-style GUI, but I would rather it
work like Motif
   (although the CDE is horridly ugly).

In addition to creating a JOS L&amp;F, we might also create some emulations
of other UIs, but I've been told we will have to be careful of copyright
infringement.  It might be good to have someone responsible for
investigating this issue.

For an example of PL&amp;F, look in the Java 1.2 API spec under the
javax.swing.plaf.* packages (the default
look and feel is in the javax.swing.plaf.metal package).  Also read some
of the pages at 
the Swing Connection: <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/,">http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/,</A>
specifically the PLAF papers and a link
I have put on the OrgJosPlaf page.

As far as development requirements, you have all you need, although I
would recommend a good development environment. Hope this helps.
