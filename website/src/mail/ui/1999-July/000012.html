It would probably fit in the periphery since it has absolutley nothing to do anything with the other projects but kinda something to do with it. And this is the mailing list for it, projects dont get
their own lists as of yet.

That would be part of JADE (see Wiki: JADE)

Be careful about this, creating a L&amp;F and peer/UI mapping are two seperate things a different project might be less confusing and add some order allowing these two goals to be reached more rapidly.

	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
