</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Either it runs all of the old code or it doesn't. People want code that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; works. They don't want excuses. They want to hear that your code still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; works. And it will survive the next half-dozen upgrades.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm sorry the old code doesn't work. I don't want this kind of thing to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; happen each time we upgrade to a new version of JOS. Sun Microsystems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; believes that the new JDK is compatible enough to run all of the old code.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And then, they have a long, long list of exceptions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The old code I wrote doesn't work on the new JDK. I believe that this is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; threat to an open source project. Why should we write a bunch of code for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Java 2.0 (1.2) code if it isn't going to work on Java 3.0?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It stings. It hurts. It's rude. Sun Microsystems should be ashamed of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; themselves. They use a practice that doesn't work. It doesn't have to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that way.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's why we should not immitate Sun Microsystems when we create a JOS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; API. That is why it is so important to try to make long-lasting interfaces
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for these JOS-related things.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't know what else to do about it. I keep hammering away at the bad
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attitudes. It is not acceptable to build reasonable incompatibility.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Reasonable incompatibility means that it doesn't have to work. Heise's code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should work today on a JDK 2.0 just as it did when it was written. Isn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that what Write Once really means?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't mean to be that harsh!  There are two identifiable reasons why
</I>&gt;<i> his code doesn't work on my JDK.  The first is that all of the swing
</I>&gt;<i> packages are named com.sun.java.swing.*, whereas Java2 uses
</I>&gt;<i> javax.swing.*.  The second is the same reason why I had trouble with
</I>&gt;<i> creating my own toolkit: java.awt.Toolkit maintains a reference to the
</I>&gt;<i> first initialized toolkit, preventing a subsitute toolkit from doing the
</I>&gt;<i> job.  I agree with your disgust over Sun's lack of backwards and
</I>&gt;<i> forwards compatibility, but that's not the type of discussion (or
</I>&gt;<i> argument) I meant to start!
