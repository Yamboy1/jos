Well, I'm just glad it works!  Took long enough to get to this point,
didn't it?

(1) However, I confess I forgot (if I ever knew definitively) who's
doing the keyboard driver, and who's doing the VGA driver.

(2) With respect to drivers, there's the recurring issue of how to get
all this code written by all these different people to play together
nicely.  With the JVM, the interface spec was pretty well-defined (it
was the JVM spec -- not too much room for creativity there!).  Getting
the JVM and the pico/femto (whatever) kernel to play together nicely
only entailed Todd and I working together.  However, with the drivers,
and with the address spaces (etc.), things are pretty nebulous, and
there are a LOT more people involved.

I was thinking we could just reimplement the &quot;JavaOS for Business&quot; APIs,
which seem pretty well thought out to me.  There is a sort of &quot;registry&quot;
(which I know there's been a lot of discussion about on the JOS lists)
which unifies (as near as I can tell from the &quot;Inside JavaOS&quot; book) the
WIndoze-type registry, and the UNIX-type &quot;device&quot; hierarchy, and it
provides a mechanism for booting and device discovery, and even dynamic
device discovery (e.g., removable media), etc.  I'd be interested in
what people on the kernel list have to say about this.

Please be so kind as to open URL:
	<A HREF="http://jos.org/pipermail/admin/1999-July/000110.html">http://jos.org/pipermail/admin/1999-July/000110.html</A>
which discusses the issue, and respond to the kernel list.  There was no
response on the admin list.  (I'm also cc-ing the UI folk, because this
touches upon the VGA/SVGA/whatever driver issue, and I'm also cc-ing the
general list, because it's a general issue.)

Thanks,

-jm
