<PRE>Modern computers can be shutdown via the OS, JOS as a modern OS needs to
support this. A PowerController class would be a singelton that
interfaced to the kernel that lets you turn off the computer, reboot it,
put it in sleep mode, et al. the UI would have a shutdown action that
called the shutdownDialog that just called the PowerController. The OS
would have to tell every process, via a SystemEvent? (or a PowerEvent?)
to close. JADE would send a windowClosing event to all its frames, the
various components in JOS would shutdown (and serialize if applicable)
and then the computer would be told to shutdown

since PowerController dosent know what is in JOS (some of it being
dynamic, some of it being add ons or whatever) there should be a
[System|Power]Event of some sort that is sent to all its componenent and
applications (non-JOS stuff will have the legacy equiv. called by its
parent system (an app told to exit via its process).

basically the idea is PowerController is called by UI or other, it sends
events, stuff shutdown. computer goes night-night.

Cheers,
DigiGod

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
