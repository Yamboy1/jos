<PRE>this is in response to GilbertHerschberger's article UIPurposeDesktop on
the Wiki (a prerequiste to this e-mail):

personally Ive always thought of the desktop as a pretty background to
the windows Im working with (which I always keep maximized, personal
prefference I guess)

the desktop itself does not run commands, well neither does the
commandline; thats what we have JADE for. JADE processes commands for
all the UI's since they all need to process commands and the only
difference is how they abstract that to the user.

good idea bout a shortcut/link/whatever referencing itself, I wouldnt
have caught that

whats the difference between a bookmark and a link? all I can see is
that bookmarks are further abstracted by the application using them
(with a treeview for editing and pulldown for accessing)

Ive often mentioned my idea of an abstract screen thats extended to a
&quot;DesktopScreen&quot; after reading this article (and some talking on UI) I
think this is a good hierarchy

Screen
 |
 +-TextScreen (CLI's)
 |  |
 |  +-TexttopScreen (TUI's, Desktop... Texttop... get it? in other
words, needs a better name)
 |
 +-GraphicsScreen
    |
    +-DesktopScreen (GUI's)
       |
       +-IconDesktopScreen

Screen is the abstract super class that offers all the stuff they'd all
need (like Dimension size() and all that).

TextScreen is for CLI's and has all that lovely text support stuff

GraphicsScreen is a screen with AWT Graphics Support (probably
subclassed for a 3DGraphicsScreen by XUI's), it has a setBackground
thats lets you set the backfground pic (Im working on a Background class
for general use thats really flexible, animation the whole sh'bang) (or
should this be in DesktopScreen?))

DesktopScreen adds support for moving AWT windows around and drawing
them and all that fun

IconDesktopScreen adds support for icons on the desktop (no fixed
layout, thats what I hate about w9x and mac, I always wanted them across
the top like everywhere else in the bloody OSes)

personally Id just use DesktopScreen let the taskmanager and the
applauncher deal with the rest.

ooh! heres another idea, VirtualScreen extends GraphicsScreen (or just
screen?) and handles switching between different Screen types for true
VirtualScreen support (as handled not by JADE but a JADE PUI (VWSS
--VirtualWindow SupportSystem?) that acts like a socket for other,
mutliple PUI's)

Cheers,
DigiGod

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
