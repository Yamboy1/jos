Again, I disagree.  There is no reason why a plain, vga text mode
command line interface should not be available.  What if the user is
trying to test an experimental graphics driver?  Certainly it doesn't
make sense to have a GUI already loaded with a graphics-based CLI in
it.  There might be conflicts with the current graphics device (maybe
it's a standard VGA or other driver).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hmm... I don't know if this is necessary because JOS is supposed to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allow users to specify drivers while the system (gui/cli/etc) is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; running.  Most driver changes should not require a reboot or special
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; startup selection procedures.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> again i just meant that this gives you a startup configuration .. i _hope_

</I>
The startup configuration should only be specified at install time. 
After that, all driver changes should be made through tools that access
the registry.  I see no point for a startup configuration change unless
it is to use a minimal configuration (like Windows safe mode).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What are you trying to say?  If you're referring to a registry, there is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already one in the making.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> exactly what i thought of ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; AFAIK from discussions with Digigod, JADE is the underlying system upon
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which all UIs rest.  It provides things that are common among the UIs,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like receiving keystrokes, handling graphics devices, input devices, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other output devices.  The other UIs can be then defined using JADE as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the workbeast.  For example, a Traditional GUI would ask JADE to put the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; video card in graphics mode, and ask for a specific part of the screen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to draw on.  It would not have to know how all of this is being done.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; JADE is for UIs what OO is for imperative programming -- hiding all the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work behind a nice interface, and making it reusable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> i agree in this concept ... it should be easy to port to other platforms (not
</I>&gt;<i> just x86)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> all in one it was just an idea and i wanted you all to know about it ...

</I>
We would be glad to have you on.  More important than experience is to
have an interest in what you're doing.  If you have the interest, then
you will have the impetus to learn when necessary.
