possibly it is the best then

i fear that this method will get out of control like in linux (my opinion) and that
everything is
configured by it's own text file .. i dont think this is good for a customer os
maybe for
an expert os like unix ..
that's the reason why i think that linux will never beat windoze unless somebody
invents a
customer linux (or JOS ;) )

ok .. i will follow the discussion and try to help or join when possible ..
