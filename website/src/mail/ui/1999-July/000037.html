Well in JOS it wont matter since it will be the default toolkit for one
thing.

also Id like to say this is part of JADE, and should be in something
like org.jos.experimental.seancribbs.ui.jade.awt.JOSToolkit.

cant component, container, frame and all that just be lightweight and
have all the graphics stuff in Window?(since thats where it all comes
from) and that just use the Screen (or whatever).

Cheers,
DigiGod
