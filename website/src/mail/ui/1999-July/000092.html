what if all your peers subclassed from JComponent? wouldnt that solve
many of the problems. you create a superclass that does the standard
configuration for JComponent (seeting isOpaque to true and the like) you
wouldnt need to change the L&amp;F's in tandem since the peers would be
linked to the UIManager (I think)

just an idea

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
