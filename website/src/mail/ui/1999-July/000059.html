I assume that would work.  I was just too lazy to edit the source.

Actually, that may not be necessary.  There's an idea brewing in my head
right now about how to overcome this major difficulty.  I'll get back to
you when I have something concrete.

</I>
I would hope that JOS will support the latest JDK, whatever version it
will be, when it is released.  For now, I think we should assume JDK1.2
-- it has more functionality and is mostly backwards compatible.
