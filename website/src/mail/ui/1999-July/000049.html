That shouldnt be to hard, we'd just need to copy how they do in Swing...

well thats fine for now, but Im saying eventually we should redo it the
better way and we might as well figure out how to do it now.

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
