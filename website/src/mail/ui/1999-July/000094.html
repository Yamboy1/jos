I don't quite see the usefulness of this. For example, when you
implement the Swing or AWT widgets, they will handle rectangles and
z-ordering in their own way.

If you were suggesting the idea in response to my observation that there
needs to be some view &lt;-&gt; view interactions, are you trying to eliminate
these interactions? I think when you get around to implementing your
Swing widgets, you will find that the most sensible thing to do is to
have direct view &lt;-&gt; view interactions when they are needed. For
example, when a JComponent needs to be graphically added to a JPanel.
Just keep in mind that these view &lt;-&gt; view methods are internal
implementation methods, and the real methods to add a ToolbarWidget to a
DesktopWidget are in the controller and model classes.

&gt;<i> &gt; There is probably very little you can decide about the view interfaces
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at this point in time. When you start to consider how the controllers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and models come in to play, your design will probably change completely.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I definately think it is easier to start designing from the model end.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Even then, your design will change a bit when you start to consider how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the view fits into the picture. But at least when you get there, you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will have already thought about the foundations of your MVC system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> you may be right, but we could at least get a basic idea of what we need
</I>&gt;<i> to put them in, but more importantly (and Ive tried to stress this) of
</I>&gt;<i> which ones to include that list I gave was far from complete, and some
</I>&gt;<i> of them should have different, more appropriate, names.
</I>
That's reasonable. Ok,

PagerWidget - control for virtual desktops
MenuWidget - for example, you could dock a start menu to the
TaskBarWidget.

I'm thinking we should call it a system menu, not a start menu.
