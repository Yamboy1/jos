firstly I cant see how that would fall to JADE (or even JOS for that
matter--it should be a JOS Library); JADE is after all just a liaison
between the user and the OS...

JMF (JavaMediaFramework) has something like this (for media only), JAF
(JActivationF) has something kinda like this but for a different use
(but I think it should be from the same place...) and I tried tackling
this problem myself (with an uberversion of the HotJava content
handlers) although I eventually moved on, I could send what I did to you
if you want.

Cheers,
DigiGod

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
