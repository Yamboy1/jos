</I>&gt;<i> is th best way to handle the file type chaos ...
</I>
this is kinda what I was working on, except it wraps it in a quasibean
created for each type...
 
&gt;<i> &gt; JMF (JavaMediaFramework) has something like this (for media only), JAF
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (JActivationF) has something kinda like this but for a different use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (but I think it should be from the same place...) and I tried tackling
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this problem myself (with an uberversion of the HotJava content
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; handlers) although I eventually moved on, I could send what I did to you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if you want.
</I>&gt;<i> i'd really like to see it but i can't promise that i'll have enough time to
</I>&gt;<i> read it that intesitively ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> but tell me if the idea of a datatype library (class) would be good or is
</I>&gt;<i> there enough support in the java apis ?!
</I>
you could get by with the java apis, but technically you could survive
in the sierra with a poncho and a coffee can (Im saying Id rather not
:<i>). they don't offer as eloquent a solution as Id like.

Cheers,

Postscript: Im sending my work to you in a separate e-mail as a .zip
file (its not what one would describe as &quot;finished&quot; or &quot;runnable&quot; but
its better then nothing I guess ;)

Prank of the Moment:
	Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial
	one Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and
	conference them together. Put your own phone on mute
	and listen to see how long they'll make small talk before
	figuring out that neither one placed the call.
