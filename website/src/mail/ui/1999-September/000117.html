<PRE>I just read the TGUIGroup Wiki page and realized that people are (better
&quot;were&quot; .. last statement was on Jan99) talking about data formats that
should be used in JOS ...
My opinion about this is that something super-level app should care
about formats not the apps themselves ... propably this could be the job
of JADE ??! ...
It should support as most picture,sound,font,movie (or whatever) formats
as possible ..
a jos app should call a method in jade to load a pic for example and
jade cares about the format and looks up in a table if any
codes/format-loader-classed are available and returns the pic in a java
class ... so apps would be independant of file formats ... like MS who
&quot;invented&quot; the MediaPlayer2 (in fact they reinvented it ! .. the amiga
had a mechanism called Datatypes and through a special library you were
able to load a pic and get a bitmap of it ..)

I would really like to know your opinions about this because it could
make developing really easy ...
