<PRE>Hi all,

Though I am pleased as pie that the Constitution passed (and unanimous!), I
am a bit disappointed at the low voter turnout.  Makes me wonder if we were
right on with the quorum or we should have upped it more.

Now that we have a process to make binding decisions, here are the next
steps we need to consider:
   * Incorporation as a non-profit entity.  I think we need to do this
before Helmut will give us ownership of the jos.org domain name, and we will
finally be able to put some of these administrative issues to rest.  We need
to collectively discuss the ways we can go about doing this.  Do we
want/have to have a 'board of directors', and other issues such as this.
   * Licenses. [dodges the tomatoes].  JOS is finally getting somewhere, and
we are coming to a point where we need some kind of coherent licensing
strategy.  For the longest time I was waiting on Clark's configurable
licence.  After discussions with Clark, though, I've found out that this
simply isn't coming.  My suggestion is that we recommend to every JOS
developer the LGPL for new projects.  Here's why:
      * Some developers have already selected licenses for various pieces of
JOS code.  JJOS and decaf especially.  I don't want to step on their toes,
and their rights as developers.  I would let it be up to each developer
whether to or not to change to the standard license.  All new code submitted
to JOS should use the standard license.
      * Why the LGPL?  For me, this is a practical matter only.  There is a
lot of code out there that we will *need* to make use of which is GPL'd or
LGPL'd in the vast majority ($Classpath is the prime example).  If we don't
have a license that is compatible with the GPL, then we won't be able to
utilize that code, especially as we will have to make changes to $classpath.
(I would love for someone to prove me wrong, here.)  I recommend the LGPL to
make sure that others can build on top of our API's without licensing
problems.  I know that there are developers who absolutely will not
contribute to a GPL'd project.  I hate to lose 'ya but we have to move
forward.  I hope you will rethink that position with respect to our current
situtation.

Thoughts, questions, flames?

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>    * 46 possible Voters
</I>&gt;<i>    * 12 vote quorum (&quot;extraordinary&quot; vote (25%))

</I>&gt;<i> There were a total of 13 Votes placed during the voting period out of a
