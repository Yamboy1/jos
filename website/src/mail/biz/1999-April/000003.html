<PRE>I just made some changes to the VoteLiteFAQ on the wiki to answer the 
concerns just brought up.

I added the following sections:
&quot;Do we really need abstain and neither?&quot;
&quot;HUH?!? Isn't this a bit complicated?&quot; and
&quot;How will the Constitution be ratified?&quot;

I also made the following change to &quot;How do I call a vote in this system?&quot;
Also, an objection could be raised if the wording of the vote was such that 
if it did not pass, then a change would be made. The Constitution specifies 
that all votes must be worded such that a failed vote maintains the status 
quo.

I'm not sure that the Constitution explicitely states that an objection can 
be made for that reason, but it does state that all questions should 
maintain the status quo if they are not passed.  A small change may need to 
be made to the proposed Constitution to address this.

Please go to <A HREF="http://jos.org/wiki/view/main/VoteLiteFAQ">http://jos.org/wiki/view/main/VoteLiteFAQ</A> at your convenience 
and look over my explanations.  If you feel they are still not clear 
enough, go ahead and make any necessary changes.

Regards,
Avery J. Regier
