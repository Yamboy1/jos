<PRE>how about doing 1] with the following:
* If an objection is raised (for either reason) the vote caller has the 
option whether to change the wording of the question or the vote 
administrator (whichever the objection was raised about) or to go ahead 
with the vote.
* If an vote which has been objected to is not withdrawn or changed, then a 
note shall be attached to the question being voted upon which contains the 
nature of the objection and an explanation indicating that if the voting 
member agrees with the objection, they can cast a 'neither' vote.
* We may or may not want to do the following:  The person who raised the 
objection shall have his/her name attached to the objection which shall be 
a direct quote of the objection.

The last piece would take care of two possible abuses of this system:
1) Objections being placed in a whimiscal manner.  The person raising the 
objection must be willing to put his/her good name on the line.
2) The nature of the objection being misstated on the vote.

Any thoughts?

Good job with the FAQ.  WRT the wording restriction, I see 3 main
alternatives:
 1] deal with it in the Constitution in a similar manner to the vote
administrator objection
 2] leave the Constitution alone and assign enforcement to the voting
_list_ adminstrator in the policy book
 3] make sure that this policy is mentioned prominently in the FAQ and
the FAQ published frequently in the list, add a statement to the Policy
book that a &quot;neither&quot; vote is the control on this specific brand of
improperly worded vote, and let the voters enforce this provision
My main problem with #1 is a repetition to my reservation about the rule
that objections to vote administrators not be used to prevent a vote
from taking place.  The reservation is that this creates an important
Constitutional restriction without a procedure or an authority to
enforce it.  Unfortunate, but acceptable for one unique restriction,
IMHO.  I'm not sure adding another such rule to regulate abuse of the
&quot;status quo&quot; objection is a good idea.  Option #2 creates an
extra-constitutional authority with considerable power.  IMO this is
_not_ good.  Option #3 trusts the voters to debate the vote wording and
to object to it with a vote of &quot;neither&quot; if it violates the &quot;status quo&quot;
rule.  This is within the domain of the &quot;neither&quot; vote as we have
proposed it, is it not?
&gt;&gt;<i>I also made the following change to &quot;How do I call a vote in this
</I>system?&quot;
   Also, an objection could be raised if the wording of the vote was
such that
   if it did not pass, then a change would be made. The Constitution
specifies
   that all votes must be worded such that a failed vote maintains the
status
   quo.

   I'm not sure that the Constitution explicitely states that an
objection can
   be made for that reason, but it does state that all questions should
   maintain the status quo if they are not passed.  A small change may
need to
   be made to the proposed Constitution to address this.&lt;&lt;
