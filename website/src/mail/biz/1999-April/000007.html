<PRE>I contacted Ken Arnold at Sun (<A HREF="mailto:Ken.Arnold@East.Sun.COM">Ken.Arnold@East.Sun.COM</A>) about the Jini
license, and this is what he had to say:

&gt;<i>basically the idea is that non-profits can
</I>&gt;<i>use Jini without charge.  They still must sign a public distribution
</I>&gt;<i>license
</I>&gt;<i>(misnamed the &quot;Commercial&quot; license) and the trademark license, but can
</I>&gt;<i>get their fees waived (clause B2.3 in the trademark license).  And, of 
</I>&gt;<i>course, you must pass the conformance test (the TCK) and use the logo.
</I>&gt;<i>The conformance test is self-certifying, so it, too, is cost free.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In short, if you aren't doing it for commercial profit, it should cost
</I>&gt;<i>you no dollars.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>		Ken
</I>
From what I see, there shouldn't be much of a legal problem with using Jini,
but we could just as easily implement a local driver registration system,
and keep it open so that we can develop products that can act as middleware
between our registration and Jini - this way we only need to do the
conformance tests on that middleware package, instead of the OS, and we
wouldn't need our users to jump through hoops to sign Sun licenses to look
at the OS code.

Just my $0.02.
