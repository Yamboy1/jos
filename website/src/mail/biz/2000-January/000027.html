We need to do something. We need to do it now. I am concerned about
misrepresentation of the JOS Project as well as offending our membership.
Failing to clarify becomes a misrepresentation that grows over time. As
long as we let the ambiguity stand, it becomes increasingly difficult to
fix it. Leaving the issue alone would be a disservice to the members of the
JOS Project and the community at large.

How is a member offended? Members are offended, and should be, when others
break their promise. It is most helpful to put the promise in writing. It
is helpful to clarify the promise -- sooner rather than later. Since the
JOS Project intends to build software and distribute it with a free
software license, I am more than happy to participate. Since the JOS
Project intends to publish the source code for everyone to see, I am more
than happy to participate.

If, by some blatent disregard for the articles already published on the JOS
website, the JOS Project votes to abandon their free-license or open-source
promises, I would be offended. Wouldn't you?

Unfortunately, I have read many articles and Java programs that reference
the &quot;JOS License&quot; as if it already exists. We should do something to make
the JOS license concrete instead of leaving it up in the air. We should
clarify our attitude toward &quot;modules&quot; within the operating system as a
whole. Like any author, a member of the JOS project reserves the right to
release a product under GPL or LGPL.

I think we've obligated ourselves to finish the JOS License once we
started. A &quot;official&quot; JOS license might be drafted as a minimalist effort,
simply including the text of LGPL by reference. Such a license would enable
members of the JOS project to refer to the mainstream JOS license.

It is not feasible to search and destroy all references to the &quot;JOS
License&quot;. The &quot;JOS License&quot; should cover all of the articles and Java
programs that reference it directly. An author would have to choose to
publish under a &quot;JOS License&quot;.

&gt;<i>After all, JOS is currently made up of multiple licenses and unless a
</I>&gt;<i>significant number of people are unhappy, we should just leave things
</I>&gt;<i>the way they are. We just need to clarify the way things are.
</I>
I agree whole heartedly. JOS as a whole is currently made up of multiple
licenses, and should be. We must be responsible toward our members and our
community to clarify what it is and how it works.

It might clarify our position of free license and open source to publish
&quot;official&quot; licensing guidelines for members of the JOS project to use. As a
group, we might recommend (and assist) an author to publish under LGPL.

I wonder what other members think about the &quot;commecial use&quot; issues of the
JOS Project. I have been unable to find answers to these questions:

1. If a commercial vendor (like Compaq, Dell, Gateway or IBM) wants to
distribute JOS (or parts of JOS) with every new machine, should we abandon
our free-license promise? Personally, I think we must stick to our
free-license or open-source promise because it is the right thing to do.

2. If a commercial vendor (like IBM, Microsoft, Red Hat or Sun
Microsystems) wants to distribute JOS (or parts of JOS) with their
commercial software, should we abandon our free-license promise?
Personally, I think we must stick to our free-license or open-source
promise no matter who benefits.

3. If any commercial vendor wants to start with JOS (or parts of JOS) and
create a commercial-licensed or closed-source clone, should we abandon our
open-source promise? I think we must stick to free-license and open-source
in every case.

4. If a member of the JOS project wants to fork JOS into a for-profit,
closed-source commercial venture, what kind of effect does that have on the
JOS Project? Personally, some of my work is open source; some of it is
commericial. My best work is open source; but, I have to feed my family.
Open source may not be the best choice for everyone. To any member that
forks the JOS Project, I wish them well.
