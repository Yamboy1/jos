I don't agree that we need a JOS license, or at least, I have not made
up my mind on the matter. So I would suggest we make this the first item
on our agenda.

As Regier pointed out, whichever license we decide on, people will
disagree and leave the project. For instance, I would probably leave the
project if I were not able to contribute GPL'ed code to JOS. Sure, the
code I contributed to the JJOS kernel was not under GPL but it benefited
me to make the contribution nonetheless.

I believe we can support multiple licenses in JOS, but more on that
later. First I will make a case for using the GPL in certain parts of
JOS.

The case for (L)GPL is that it might be the most practical solution in
terms of what reusable code is already available to you. If you look at
all the existing open-source software out there directly related to what
we're doing, virtually all of the major projects have chosen to use the
GPL or LGPL:

Kaffe - <A HREF="http://www.kaffe.org/">http://www.kaffe.org/</A> - GPL
	* A free JIT-enabled JVM complete with JDK 1.1 class libraries.
japhar - <A HREF="http://www.japhar.org/">http://www.japhar.org/</A> - LGPL
	* Another free JVM (works with Classpath)
TYA - <A HREF="http://www.dragon1.net/software/tya/">http://www.dragon1.net/software/tya/</A> - GPL
	* A free JIT
Classpath - <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/">http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/</A> - LGPL
	* Free implementation of JDK 1.1 (and some 1.2) libraries
GCJ - <A HREF="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/java/">http://sourceware.cygnus.com/java/</A> - LGPL
	* Java to native compiler
Echidna - <A HREF="http://www.javagroup.org/echidna/">http://www.javagroup.org/echidna/</A> - LGPL
	* Adds process support to Java (pure Java solution)
Alta - <A HREF="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/java/alta/index.html">http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/java/alta/index.html</A> - GPL
	* Adds process support to JVM (based on kaffe - to be released)

In fact, I have not found any major Java OS related projects that have
not decided to go with the GPL or LGPL, but if anyone knows of any,
please provide a list.

The GPL was designed to support collaboration and code sharing within
the free software community, and that code sharing could really pay off
in our case because a lot of GPL'ed software has already been written in
this area. I would have expected jm and _quinn to take advantage of this
in the kernel and the JVM, but they chose not to, for various reasons.
&gt;<i>From memory, (and please correct me if I have it wrong) jm would like to
</I>allow commercial exploitation which the GPL can't provide (he's also
very smart when it comes to operating systems, and nothing else out
there is good enough for him to reuse). _quinn always intended to write
the whole jvm from scratch as a learning experience, and so code sharing
under the GPL did not provide any benefit. This allowed him to release
his code under a license compatible with jm's kernel so that they could
closely integrate the two products.

I respect their decisions and I expect other programmers will also
have their personal preference.

The way to support multiple licenses is to make the operating system
modular and allow a different license for each module. If you consider
a typical Linux OS, the Linux kernel is just one module - it is released
under the GPL. The license explicitly states that anything that runs on
top of the kernel is not bound by the same license. The rest of the
operating system is made up of hundreds of individual programs running
on top of the kernel and each individual program is free to use whatever
license it wishes.

I am not sure of the exact figure, but at least 31% of a typical Linux
distribution consists of GPL or LGPL software. This figure does not
account for GPL'ed or LGPL'ed software that is not officially GNU
Software (apart from the Linux kernel itself which I did include). The
point is, the rest of the 100% consists of software from various other
licenses. For example, the X Window System implementation that is
distributed with Linux (XFree86) comes under a modified X Consortium
license. This component is so integral to the operating system as a
whole, yet it is released under a different license.

In conclusion, allowing multiple licenses makes JOS attractive to more
people. Hopefully this can be resolved without a vote - we should not
force an issue that may lead many members to leave the project. After
all, JOS is currently made up of multiple licenses and unless a
significant number of people are unhappy, we should just leave things
the way they are. We just need to clarify the way things are.
