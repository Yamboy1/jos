That's a good idea. Debian has such a thing:

	<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">http://www.debian.org/social_contract</A>

We could simply say that a component can be officially accepted as part
of JOS if it meets the Open Source Definition.

Actually, when I joined the project two years ago, it was advertised as
an &quot;Open Source&quot; operating system. I and many others joined JOS under
this impression. It seems less clear now as the web pages have been
changed to say &quot;open&quot; rather than &quot;open source&quot;.

I think some sort of social contract (as described above) could have
prevented this confusion.

&gt;<i> Unfortunately, I have read many articles and Java programs that reference
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;JOS License&quot; as if it already exists. We should do something to make
</I>&gt;<i> the JOS license concrete instead of leaving it up in the air. We should

</I>&gt;<i> release a product under GPL or LGPL.
</I>
I also noticed people referring to this non-existent &quot;JOS License&quot;. It
seems silly to put your trust in a license that is yet to be defined,
especially considering that at one time people were trying to
incorporate a royalty system into the license.

You are right in wanting to clarify the modules of JOS. This was one
intention of the <A HREF="mailto:arch@jos.org">arch@jos.org</A> list. Once we have mapped out the
architecture, we will then see our options for the application of
multiple licenses. The idea of the single JOS license (I suspect) was
that people thought of JOS as having a one huge Java layer full of
internal dependencies. Now we have a more useful way of looking at JOS.

As I see it, the interfaces between modules can be placed under the
public domain. Individual modules can be under any license (although it
must conform to the Open Source Definition to be part of JOS). Libraries
used by parts of JOS should use a library-type license such as LGPL or
the MIT license (among others). These licenses place no restrictions on
the licenses of the programs that use those libraries.

&gt;<i> I think we've obligated ourselves to finish the JOS License once we
</I>&gt;<i> started.  -- snip --
</I>&gt;<i> It is not feasible to search and destroy all references to the &quot;JOS
</I>&gt;<i> License&quot;.
</I>
Why not ask the respective authors if they wish to change their license
before we potentially define the JOS license to be something they
disagree with?

Changing a license is not that big a deal. It is tedious but it happens
all the time. The Kaffe JVM had to go through this when it changed from
using a BSD license to using the GPL, and they have a much larger code
base than what is covered under the JOS License.

It is hard to say at this point in time what licenses all this existing
code should go under, because in my mind, the development of the Java
layer of JOS has not even begun. People have basically been submitting
code that they think &quot;might&quot; be useful to JOS but have no idea how it
will fit in exactly. Real development will begin after we have a plan,
and that will occur after a Systems Architect has plotted out the
modules. Then we can see how the existing code fits in, if indeed it
does fit in, and we can work out the most appropriate license to stamp
on that code.

&gt;<i> I wonder what other members think about the &quot;commecial use&quot; issues of the
</I>&gt;<i> JOS Project. I have been unable to find answers to these questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. If a commercial vendor (like Compaq, Dell, Gateway or IBM) wants to
</I>&gt;<i> distribute JOS (or parts of JOS) with every new machine, should we abandon
</I>&gt;<i> our free-license promise? Personally, I think we must stick to our
</I>&gt;<i> free-license or open-source promise because it is the right thing to do.
</I>
Open Source licenses do not and cannot place this restriction. Compaq
and Dell are free to distribute and sell JOS with their computers if we
use an Open Source license. The issue of making money from Open Source
software is described at:

	<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">http://www.opensource.org/</A>

&gt;<i> 2. If a commercial vendor (like IBM, Microsoft, Red Hat or Sun
</I>&gt;<i> Microsystems) wants to distribute JOS (or parts of JOS) with their
</I>&gt;<i> commercial software, should we abandon our free-license promise?
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I think we must stick to our free-license or open-source
</I>&gt;<i> promise no matter who benefits.
</I>
I believe that even with an Open Source license, IBM or Microsoft are
free to do this, as long as they meet the distribution terms of the
license. For example, if they distribute GPL'ed software with their own
software, they must include the source code to the GPL'ed portions.

&gt;<i> 3. If any commercial vendor wants to start with JOS (or parts of JOS) and
</I>&gt;<i> create a commercial-licensed or closed-source clone, should we abandon our
</I>&gt;<i> open-source promise? I think we must stick to free-license and open-source
</I>&gt;<i> in every case.
</I>
There is nothing we can do to prevent clones, but don't forget that JOS
is already a clone of Java OS! (Ok, it's not an exact clone, but...)

&gt;<i> 4. If a member of the JOS project wants to fork JOS into a for-profit,
</I>&gt;<i> closed-source commercial venture, what kind of effect does that have on the
</I>&gt;<i> JOS Project? Personally, some of my work is open source; some of it is
</I>&gt;<i> commericial. My best work is open source; but, I have to feed my family.
</I>&gt;<i> Open source may not be the best choice for everyone. To any member that
</I>&gt;<i> forks the JOS Project, I wish them well.
</I>
This is clause 3 from the Open Source Definition:

        3. Derived Works

        The license must allow modifications and derived works,
	and must allow them to be distributed under the same
	terms as the license of the original software.

So again, an open source license must allow forks. Whether or not the
fork can be proprietary is up to the particular license. If we follow a
modular design, it may be that some modules allow proprietary forks and
others do not.

If you are interested in making money off JOS, have a look at the
approaches major Linux distributors have taken. Some simply put together
a distribution of pure open source components and sell the CDs. Others
include proprietary components and sell CDs at a higher price.
