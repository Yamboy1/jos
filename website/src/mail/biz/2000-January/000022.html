<PRE>The first thing on our agenda (since we already decided we need a JOS
license) is to define our license options. What kind of license is possible?

Option 1. After we write code, we can always put it in the public domain.
In a broad sense, it is a license for others to use the code in any way, at
any time, by anyone. Once it is introduced into the public domain,
copyright and patents are nul and void. Anyone can rewrite the code and
distribute it under the same brand name.

Option 2. We could copyright our code and provide a software license to
anyone without a license fee. This would enable anyone to customize the
source code for any purpose, inside any derivative work (both open and
proprietary). Unlike putting the code in public domain, this license would
prevent others from rewriting the code and distributing it under the same
brand name.

Option 3. We could copyright our code and provide a free software license
to anyone in the free license community. This would enable anyone in the
free license community to customize the source code for any purpose as long
as the customize code is distributed under a free license. Unlike option 2,
this license would prevent the inclusion of the product in a proprietary or
commercial product. The license is not available to commercial products.

Option 4. We could copyright our code and provide a free software license
to anyone who wants to use the code in any way, except customization. This
code could be used in an open or proprietary product as long as it is used
without modification in any way. To modify such software, users would be
required to participate in a negotiation with the original author. This
kind of license enables anyone to read the source code, learn more about
writing and using source code, use the intellectual property expressed in
the soure code, and copy-and-paste idioms of source code into other products.

Option 5. We can write our software under the Sun Microsystems' Community
Software License. Without Sun Microsystems' seal of approval, &quot;JOS&quot; is a
&quot;free, virtual machine-based operating system.&quot;

A software license can forbid the use of a brand-name to describe a
software clone. No software license can forbid the creation of a clone.
Such a license would be anti-competitive, monopolistic and prevent a level
playing field in a free market. If a clone is developed under the strict
guidelines of cleanroom implementation, source code developed in a
cleanroom can be perfectly compatible with another software product.

In other words, you can create a 100% perfectly compatible clone of the
Java Virtual Machine -- without the blessing of Sun Microsystems -- as long
as you call it something else. (a) You cannot call it Java(tm) because
Java(tm) is a brand-name. (b) You cannot say that it is Java(tm)-compatible
because Sun Microsystems is the only organization that can give the
Java(tm)-compatibility seal of approval. (c) You can say that it is a
virtual machine (lower case) because &quot;virtual machine&quot; is a generic name
for any kind of virtual machine. (d) You can use terms such as &quot;bytecode&quot;,
&quot;opcode&quot;, &quot;class&quot;, and &quot;interface&quot; because these are generic terms.
