<PRE>Gibert has shown what our options are (though I think he missed a few, where
would the (L)GPL fit in that list, or the current license used by
JJOS/decaf?) now we need to think about what we need in a license:

1)  We need to legally be able to incorporate GPL'd and LGPL'd works into
JOS.  There is an emourmous amount of work that has already been done that
we don't have the time to do (if we want JOS within the next two years,
anyways).  Included among these are the Classpath project
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/,">http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/,</A> dnsjava
<A HREF="http://www.xbill.org/dnsjava/,">http://www.xbill.org/dnsjava/,</A> kjc <A HREF="http://www.dms.at/kopi/,">http://www.dms.at/kopi/,</A> etc.  Also, ther
are other projects without the GPL family of licence, including NinjaRMI
<A HREF="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mdw/proj/ninja/">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mdw/proj/ninja/</A> .

2)  We need to keep from offending core JOS contributors.  Licensing is a
sticky issue with many differing and conflicting opinions.  In previous
licensing discussion threads, I have seen people say that they won't
contribute to the project if we don't standardize on the GPL.  I've seen
others say that they won't contribute if we do standardize on the GPL.
Thus, we WILL offend somebody.  We need to be sure that those we offend
aren't contributing real code anyways instead of those contributing code.
(No, I'm not beating around the bush here!)  In short, we need to get the
opinions of Todd Miller and John Morrison.  They have already selected
licenses for JJOS/decaf.  We need to know if they are willing to change it
to whatever the JOS project members (as defined by the JOS Constitution)
agree upon in a vote.  We are in this position because we as a project
waited so long to define a voting system so that we could standardize on a
license.  If we had settled on one earlier, it would have been easier to get
real contributions when there is an established license.  We shouldn't
continue that mistake.

3)  It needs to be BOTH free (as in beer) AND open source.  This is the
assumption most members have made for the last two years and it would be
rather stupid of us to go in another direction.

Are there any other NEEDS in a license?
