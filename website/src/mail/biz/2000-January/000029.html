<PRE>Hello,

Sorry about jumping on this so late...

I agree with the latest sentiment that we should establish minimum 
guidelines for JOS software licenses and not establish and 
&quot;enforce&quot; a single project wide license.  

On the otherhand, there already exists a fair amount of code that is 
licensed to the JOS License which remained to be determined.  
So, I think it still behooves us to vote on establishing a &quot;defacto&quot; 
JOS License.  Then developers that don't care about license 
details, can simply license their code under the &quot;JOS License&quot; and 
be done with it.  

IMHO, the simplest, clearest, and least encumbering opensource 
license is the FreeBSD License.  It essentially is a warranty 
disclaimer and a copyright notice.  So, if an author doesn't care 
about licensing (as long as its opensource) and wants to just 
license under the &quot;JOS License&quot; it should be the FreeBSD 
License.  If people do care, they can select an alternative license 
as long as it meets the JOS License Guidelines.  Opinions?

I see no reason not to base the JOS License Guidelines on the 
debian example pointed out by Ryan:

<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">http://www.debian.org/social_contract</A>

I would like to take that document as a beginning template and 
work off of it.  If no one objects, I'll make a copy of it into the wiki.

I would also like to add an example licenses section to the 
guidelines so someone can easily choose from one of the various 
major models of open source software depending on their personal 
preference.  This would include short explanations, along with 
some &quot;boilerplate&quot; versions of the templates ready to be used.

The way I see it, there are 4 major open source models worth 
mentioning:

GPL style:  
The OpenSource status of the code MUST be maintained in 
derivative works (&quot;free-speech&quot; but not &quot;free beer&quot;).  Provides 
maximum protection of the source's &quot;open&quot; nature.

FreeBSD style:  
Derived works may be re-Licensed in any way (including continuing 
with the same license, or making it fall under a proprietary and 
closed-source license).  Provides maximum flexibility in code use 
(esp. for commercial usage).
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/copyright/copyright.html">http://www.freebsd.org/copyright/copyright.html</A>

Commercial style:  
Most of the License is that of GPL with &quot;escape&quot; clause(s) that 
allows derived works to be licensed as per a FreeBSD license 
under certain conditions.  

	Exclusive Use:
	 These conditions tend to be for the exclusive commercial use
	 of a particular entity/company (aka the Mozilla Netscape Public
	 License or Sun's SCSL that it is using for Java).  The JJOS and
	 decaf code (basically the JOS kernel) is currently under this
	 type of license.
	<A HREF="http://www.sun.com/jini/licensing/">http://www.sun.com/jini/licensing/</A>

	Publish-or-Pay
	 Some members of the JOS project were discussing the
	 alternative use of a &quot;Pay or Play&quot; clause where derivative
	 works could be &quot;escaped&quot; from the GPL like requirements by
	 paying fees.  In this case, the licensed software becomes a
	 possible source of income for the project.  A win-win situation
	 for the opensource community and commercial usage.

Library style:
This is an LGPL style license that allows much greater freedom 
than the traditional GPL license for derived and &quot;covered&quot; works.  
Basically lets anyone &quot;use&quot; an LGPL library of code for any 
purpose, without the normal GPL restrictions.
