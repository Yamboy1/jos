I would like to see members of JOS work toward a &quot;Social Contract&quot; for the
JOS Project. Such a social contract would be focus more on issues and less
on legalese.

&gt;<i>Actually, when I joined the project two years ago, it was advertised as
</I>&gt;<i>an &quot;Open Source&quot; operating system. I and many others joined JOS under
</I>&gt;<i>this impression. It seems less clear now as the web pages have been

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think some sort of social contract (as described above) could have
</I>&gt;<i>prevented this confusion.
</I>
First, we should establish a social contract. It should outline and
describe our intentions. Later -- and if necessary -- a JOS &quot;license&quot; would
be based upon the social contract.

A. JOS is big. I believe JOS must be modular, not monolithic. Each module
linked into the JOS product should have self determination. Each author
should decide what license they want to use for each module. Derivative
works must proceed on a module-by-module basis.

This kind of modular architecture brings the benefits of free market
competition. Instead of limiting JOS to one of each, there might be dozens
of competing and compatible modules to plug in a particular feature.

B. I believe JOS modules should be &quot;open source&quot; whenever possible. The
source code should be published for everyone to see. When building trust in
JOS as a viable operating systems, it helps to publish the source code.

C. I believe the process of module development should be by membership and
make use of open forums. In a sense, this kind of development remains true
to the ideas of the original author. It is a &quot;benevolent dictator&quot; approach
that has worked well for the Linux, especially the Linux kernel.

Membership means that the development process is not completely open to the
general public. Members must be screened and qualified before their
contributions are accepted, approved and redistributed. It is reasonable to
protect a JOS kernel from the hands of a novice programmer.

The development process must use open forums. By using Internet mailing
lists, the JOS Project is already using open forums.

What about the APIs required to make modules compatible with the kernel and
modules compatible with each other? The API must be open enough for
programmers to participate in the development of their own modules.
Publishing an API enables everyone to study. Opening API development
enables everyone (and anyone) to recommend their improvements.

There is far more to an API than JavaDoc. By using JOS Wiki for
documentation, the JOS Project is already publishing the APIs. We are doing
a good job. We need to clarify and put our intentions into a social contract.

This is a thought-provoking discussion. There's more to think about, isn't
there?
