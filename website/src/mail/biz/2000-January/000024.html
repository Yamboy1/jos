<PRE>There are some things we need to do before we can decide on a license:

Information gathering should be our first task:
1) We need to know if the current JJOS/decaf license will allow us to
incorporate GPL'd works.  Thus, someone needs to send an enquiry to the FSF
to find out.  Also, how easy it is to incoporate GPL'd works into GPL'd
works?  Believe it or not, that is a somewhat fuzzy issue.

2)  We need to gather the opinions of core JOS developers.  When we go to a
vote, we need to be reasonably sure it will pass and it won't offend them.

3)  We might want to do a poll of the JOS members in parallel with other
activities.  We should not wait for the results to slowly creep in before we
do other steps.

After that, we need put all of the issues together into one document, so 
4)  Write a licensing FAQ.  This has the benefit of comunicating the issues
to all of the members while helping us to think through the issues to come
to a workable conclusion.

5) Decide what license to put before the membership.

6) Draft a vote question and vote on a license.

Any other things we need to do?
