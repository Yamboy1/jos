Subject: [Biz] Changes to the Constitution and Policy Book.

Hello

Could the wording about times be change from "Greenwich Mean Time 
(GMT)" to "Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)", referrer to 
<URL:http://www.boulder.nist.gov/timefreq/faq/faq.htm#16> for my 
reason for this change.  There is also a small mistake in the policy 
book in section 1.3.

So the changed line in the constitution text would read "1.3 All 
times and dates referred to in this constitution are in Coordinated 
Universal Time (UTC).", and in the policy boot would read "1.3 All 
times and dates referred to in this policy book are in Coordinated 
Universal Time (UTC).".

Also the section 2.1.1 in the constitution reads, "2.1.1 Public means 
that the operating system is publicly controlled. Thus, no one 
individual or group of individuals may seize control of the operating 
system - even for good intentions.".  From my understanding of this 
section, we as a group of individuals working on the JOS project 
would have no control over the operating system we are working on, 
meaning we can't create this constitution.  I'm I correct?  If yes, 
this section will have to be reworded.

On the first point, the intent was to refer to a standard time base.  If
UTC is superior in this respect to GMT, IMHO JOS should use it.  On the
second, the intent was to declare the JOS project as open and public,
and to discourage any person or faction from splitting off and claiming
that they were the "true JOS" (there may be a better way to phrase this,
it's early here;>)  As it is written, I can see your interpretation as
defensible; at best, the section has become ambiguous.  Whether it's
ambiguous enough to change at this point, I dunno.  I would suggest that
the best solution may be to remove it on the premise that it's intent is
more precisely fulfilled by later parts of the Constitution.

Hello Scott

I do think that UTC is superior to GMT, so I think it should be 
changed.  As for the second change, I also think the best thing would 
be to remove the section, unless someone can come up with a better 
worded version (?).

There is a big difference between Microsoft and JOS.  

Microsoft signed an aggreement in exchange for source
code and trademark usage, which explicitly stated
that they would not be implementing an alternative
specification and calling it "Java". 

First, we will try to implement the spec where possible,
and Second, we won't be signing that agreement...
