Adric,

Actually this should be taken up on the 'biz' list.  The vote-info list is
only for notifying voting members of impending votes and not for discussion.
Both 'biz' and 'vote-info' are working.

I see three choices,

1. GPL  (which I don't like beacuse it reduces commercial potential,
         and allows others like RedHat, etc., to profit on our altruism)
          
2. BSD  (although this dosn't restrict commercial potential, it still 
         allows others to profit on our altruism without sharing their profits)

3. DC    I'm working on an alternative, it's still in the cooker, 
         however, it _is_ getting close, see distributedcopyright.org


After a few long talks with RMS, I have a _much_ better explanation
of what the goal of DC is.  Over the next few days I'm going to
remove the rambling on the front page and replace it with a more
intelligable introduction.  Also, the innerds will be developed more.
Within the next 2 weeks, I intend to have some contract language
and a corporate charter on the web for discussion as well.

I'm not sure what you all think of what I'm doing, but I've come
to very much dislike mixing "gratis" software (free of charge)
with "free" software (maintaining the users freedom of choice).

I'm all for "free" software, but don't feel we need to 
make it "gratis".  I'll post more soon.

Best,

Clark
