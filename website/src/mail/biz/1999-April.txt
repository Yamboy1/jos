Scott & Matt:

I have added you both to the biz@jos.org list (as you can see) so that we
can continue our Constitutional discussions here.  

If decide you don't want to be on this list just let me know and I'll take
you off.  If you have any problems with editing your list options or getting
your password just let me know and I'll try to figure out what is going on.
(I have had problems with the kernel & general lists that I was
autosubscribed to, so it is quite likely to be a problem.)

Thanks.

I have removed the section from the FAQ which discusses how we will
ratify the constitution since it is no longer how we feel things should
happen. I thought it would only confuse people if we left it in there.
We probably need a new answer to that question inserting into the FAQ.

Subject: [Biz] Changes to VoteLiteFAQ

I just made some changes to the VoteLiteFAQ on the wiki to answer the 
concerns just brought up.

I added the following sections:
"Do we really need abstain and neither?"
"HUH?!? Isn't this a bit complicated?" and
"How will the Constitution be ratified?"

I also made the following change to "How do I call a vote in this system?"
Also, an objection could be raised if the wording of the vote was such that 
if it did not pass, then a change would be made. The Constitution specifies 
that all votes must be worded such that a failed vote maintains the status 
quo.

I'm not sure that the Constitution explicitely states that an objection can 
be made for that reason, but it does state that all questions should 
maintain the status quo if they are not passed.  A small change may need to 
be made to the proposed Constitution to address this.

Please go to http://jos.org/wiki/view/main/VoteLiteFAQ at your convenience 
and look over my explanations.  If you feel they are still not clear 
enough, go ahead and make any necessary changes.

Avery J. Regier

Good job with the FAQ.  WRT the wording restriction, I see 3 main
alternatives:
 1] deal with it in the Constitution in a similar manner to the vote
administrator objection
 2] leave the Constitution alone and assign enforcement to the voting
_list_ adminstrator in the policy book
 3] make sure that this policy is mentioned prominently in the FAQ and
the FAQ published frequently in the list, add a statement to the Policy
book that a "neither" vote is the control on this specific brand of
improperly worded vote, and let the voters enforce this provision
My main problem with #1 is a repetition to my reservation about the rule
that objections to vote administrators not be used to prevent a vote
from taking place.  The reservation is that this creates an important
Constitutional restriction without a procedure or an authority to
enforce it.  Unfortunate, but acceptable for one unique restriction,
IMHO.  I'm not sure adding another such rule to regulate abuse of the
"status quo" objection is a good idea.  Option #2 creates an
extra-constitutional authority with considerable power.  IMO this is
_not_ good.  Option #3 trusts the voters to debate the vote wording and
to object to it with a vote of "neither" if it violates the "status quo"
rule.  This is within the domain of the "neither" vote as we have
proposed it, is it not?

From: Avery J. Regier ajregier@earthlink.net
Subject: [Biz] Changes to VoteLiteFAQ

how about doing 1] with the following:
* If an objection is raised (for either reason) the vote caller has the 
option whether to change the wording of the question or the vote 
administrator (whichever the objection was raised about) or to go ahead 
with the vote.
* If an vote which has been objected to is not withdrawn or changed, then a 
note shall be attached to the question being voted upon which contains the 
nature of the objection and an explanation indicating that if the voting 
member agrees with the objection, they can cast a 'neither' vote.
* We may or may not want to do the following:  The person who raised the 
objection shall have his/her name attached to the objection which shall be 
a direct quote of the objection.

The last piece would take care of two possible abuses of this system:
1) Objections being placed in a whimiscal manner.  The person raising the 
objection must be willing to put his/her good name on the line.
2) The nature of the objection being misstated on the vote.

Any thoughts?

Subject: [Biz] Jini license for JOS

There's been requests for using Jini with the drivers, and so I've been
working on a design for them, but it raises a question about
licensing...

Does anyone know how the Jini license would pertain to us as a
non-profit org?

here's a link to the license:

http://www.sun.com/jini/licensing/scsl_jcp_v.1.6c_web.html

I think that we may have to contact Sun about this one.

I contacted Ken Arnold at Sun (Ken.Arnold@East.Sun.COM) about the Jini
license, and this is what he had to say:

From what I see, there shouldn't be much of a legal problem with using Jini,
but we could just as easily implement a local driver registration system,
and keep it open so that we can develop products that can act as middleware
between our registration and Jini - this way we only need to do the
conformance tests on that middleware package, instead of the OS, and we
wouldn't need our users to jump through hoops to sign Sun licenses to look
at the OS code.

Just my $0.02.
