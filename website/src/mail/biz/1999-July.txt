Subject: [Biz] Changes to the Constitution and Policy Book.

I have made the following changes to the Constitution:

Difference Topic VoteLiteProp (r1.17 - 09 Jul 1999 - AveryRegier)
Difference Topic VoteLiteProp (r1.16 - 19 Jun 1998 - ScottMiller) 

Changed: 
< 1.3 All times and dates referred to in this constitution are in Greenwich
Mean Time (GMT). 
> 1.3 All times and dates referred to in this constitution are in
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). 
                     
Changed: 
< 2.1 Create a public, open source, free, extensible operating system. 
> 2.1 Create an open source, free, extensible operating system. 

Deleted: 
< 2.1.1 Public means that the operating system is publicly controlled. Thus,
no one individual or group of 
< individuals may seize control of the operating system - even for good
intentions. 

I removed 'public' from 2.1 since it is not defined in the Constitution.

I did not change the ordering of the paragraph numbers so that it will be
easy to add a modified paragraph in later.

Regards,
Avery J. Regier

Subject: [Biz] Proposed JOS Constitution Vote

Hi all,

This is the wording I propose for the upcoming vote on the Constitution and
Policy Book.

____________________________

Title:  Ratification of Proposed JOS Constitution and Policy Book
Type: Extraordinary
Proposer: Avery J. Regier [ajregier@earthlink.net]
Seconder:  {TBD}
Administrator: Iain Shigeoka [iainshigeoka@yahoo.com]

Question:
The JOS organization shall accept and ratify the proposed Constitution
(referenced at http://www.jos.org/wiki/view/main/VoteLiteProp?rev=1.17 ) and
Policy Book (referenced at
http://www.jos.org/wiki/view/main/VoteLitePolicy?rev=1.10 ) as legal and
binding on its members.

You may make the following votes:
[a] Yes (approve the proposal as stated) 
[b] No (disapprove the proposal as stated) 
[c] Neither with explanation (disagree with the phrasing of the question or
some other procedural matter) 
[d] Abstain (no preference either way) 

Please email your responses to the Vote Administrator.  Your response must
be recieved by the Vote Administrator between the following days, August 1,
1999 and August 20, 1999, inclusive.
____________________________

This is just the first draft.  Please tear apart and put back together as
necessary.  :)

Also, I need a seconder before it can be advertised.  It needs to be
officially adverised by July 18, 1999 in order for those dates to be valid.

If someone else besides Iain would like to volunteer to be the Vote
Administrator, this would be welcomed.  Iain is quite busy and would like to
be able to vote.

Speaking of which, we haven't said whether or not our 'impartial' Vote
Administrator is allowed to vote.  We haven't even said if the Vote
Administrator should be a member as defined by the Constitution.

What do you think?

Regards,
Avery J. Regier

Subject: [Biz] RE: Proposed JOS Constitution Vote

Hi all,

Due to a suggestion from last week's online JOS chat, I'm changing the 
wording of the vote to the following:

____________________________

Title:  Ratification of Proposed JOS Constitution and Policy Book
Type: Extraordinary
Proposer: Avery J. Regier [ajregier@earthlink.net]
Seconder:  {TBD}
Administrator: Iain Shigeoka [iainshigeoka@yahoo.com]

Question:
The JOS organization shall accept and ratify the proposed Constitution
(referenced at http://www.jos.org/wiki/view/main/VoteLiteProp?rev=1.17 ) 
and
Policy Book (referenced at
http://www.jos.org/wiki/view/main/VoteLitePolicy?rev=1.11 ) as binding on 
its members.

You may make the following votes:
[a] Yes (approve the proposal as stated)
[b] No (disapprove the proposal as stated)
[c] Neither with explanation (disagree with the phrasing of the question or
some other procedural matter)
[d] Abstain (no preference either way)

Please email your responses to the Vote Administrator.  Your response must
be recieved by the Vote Administrator between the following days, August 1,
1999 and August 20, 1999, inclusive.
____________________________

Note that since I have as yet not had anyone volunteer to second the 
motion, the vote cannot be advertised yet and the dates in the announcement 
are not valid. (The vote requires a 14 day advertisement period.)

As soon as someone comes forward to second the vote, I will advertise it 
and we can get underway.  I'm personally starting to wonder about the 
outcome of the vote.  There seems to be enough people who really don't care 
one way or the other that there may be a large number of 'abstain' votes, 
and there won't be enough votes left to get 60%!  :)

Regards,
Avery J. Regier
