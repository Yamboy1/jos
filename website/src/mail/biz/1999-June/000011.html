<PRE>On the first point, the intent was to refer to a standard time base.  If
UTC is superior in this respect to GMT, IMHO JOS should use it.  On the
second, the intent was to declare the JOS project as open and public,
and to discourage any person or faction from splitting off and claiming
that they were the &quot;true JOS&quot; (there may be a better way to phrase this,
it's early here;&gt;)  As it is written, I can see your interpretation as
defensible; at best, the section has become ambiguous.  Whether it's
ambiguous enough to change at this point, I dunno.  I would suggest that
the best solution may be to remove it on the premise that it's intent is
more precisely fulfilled by later parts of the Constitution.
