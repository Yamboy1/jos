<PRE>Hello

Could the wording about times be change from &quot;Greenwich Mean Time 
(GMT)&quot; to &quot;Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)&quot;, referrer to 
&lt;URL:<A HREF="http://www.boulder.nist.gov/timefreq/faq/faq.htm#16">http://www.boulder.nist.gov/timefreq/faq/faq.htm#16</A>&gt; for my 
reason for this change.  There is also a small mistake in the policy 
book in section 1.3.

So the changed line in the constitution text would read &quot;1.3 All 
times and dates referred to in this constitution are in Coordinated 
Universal Time (UTC).&quot;, and in the policy boot would read &quot;1.3 All 
times and dates referred to in this policy book are in Coordinated 
Universal Time (UTC).&quot;.

Also the section 2.1.1 in the constitution reads, &quot;2.1.1 Public means 
that the operating system is publicly controlled. Thus, no one 
individual or group of individuals may seize control of the operating 
system - even for good intentions.&quot;.  From my understanding of this 
section, we as a group of individuals working on the JOS project 
would have no control over the operating system we are working on, 
meaning we can't create this constitution.  I'm I correct?  If yes, 
this section will have to be reworded.
