<PRE>Hi all,

Due to a suggestion from last week's online JOS chat, I'm changing the 
wording of the vote to the following:

____________________________

Title:  Ratification of Proposed JOS Constitution and Policy Book
Type: Extraordinary
Proposer: Avery J. Regier [<A HREF="mailto:ajregier@earthlink.net">ajregier@earthlink.net</A>]
Seconder:  {TBD}
Administrator: Iain Shigeoka [<A HREF="mailto:iainshigeoka@yahoo.com">iainshigeoka@yahoo.com</A>]

Question:
The JOS organization shall accept and ratify the proposed Constitution
(referenced at <A HREF="http://www.jos.org/wiki/view/main/VoteLiteProp?rev=1.17">http://www.jos.org/wiki/view/main/VoteLiteProp?rev=1.17</A> ) 
and
Policy Book (referenced at
<A HREF="http://www.jos.org/wiki/view/main/VoteLitePolicy?rev=1.11">http://www.jos.org/wiki/view/main/VoteLitePolicy?rev=1.11</A> ) as binding on 
its members.

You may make the following votes:
[a] Yes (approve the proposal as stated)
[b] No (disapprove the proposal as stated)
[c] Neither with explanation (disagree with the phrasing of the question or
some other procedural matter)
[d] Abstain (no preference either way)

Please email your responses to the Vote Administrator.  Your response must
be recieved by the Vote Administrator between the following days, August 1,
1999 and August 20, 1999, inclusive.
____________________________

Note that since I have as yet not had anyone volunteer to second the 
motion, the vote cannot be advertised yet and the dates in the announcement 
are not valid. (The vote requires a 14 day advertisement period.)

As soon as someone comes forward to second the vote, I will advertise it 
and we can get underway.  I'm personally starting to wonder about the 
outcome of the vote.  There seems to be enough people who really don't care 
one way or the other that there may be a large number of 'abstain' votes, 
and there won't be enough votes left to get 60%!  :)

Regards,
Avery J. Regier
