<PRE>Hi all,

This is the wording I propose for the upcoming vote on the Constitution and
Policy Book.

____________________________

Title:  Ratification of Proposed JOS Constitution and Policy Book
Type: Extraordinary
Proposer: Avery J. Regier [<A HREF="mailto:ajregier@earthlink.net">ajregier@earthlink.net</A>]
Seconder:  {TBD}
Administrator: Iain Shigeoka [<A HREF="mailto:iainshigeoka@yahoo.com">iainshigeoka@yahoo.com</A>]

Question:
The JOS organization shall accept and ratify the proposed Constitution
(referenced at <A HREF="http://www.jos.org/wiki/view/main/VoteLiteProp?rev=1.17">http://www.jos.org/wiki/view/main/VoteLiteProp?rev=1.17</A> ) and
Policy Book (referenced at
<A HREF="http://www.jos.org/wiki/view/main/VoteLitePolicy?rev=1.10">http://www.jos.org/wiki/view/main/VoteLitePolicy?rev=1.10</A> ) as legal and
binding on its members.

You may make the following votes:
[a] Yes (approve the proposal as stated) 
[b] No (disapprove the proposal as stated) 
[c] Neither with explanation (disagree with the phrasing of the question or
some other procedural matter) 
[d] Abstain (no preference either way) 

Please email your responses to the Vote Administrator.  Your response must
be recieved by the Vote Administrator between the following days, August 1,
1999 and August 20, 1999, inclusive.
____________________________

This is just the first draft.  Please tear apart and put back together as
necessary.  :)

Also, I need a seconder before it can be advertised.  It needs to be
officially adverised by July 18, 1999 in order for those dates to be valid.

If someone else besides Iain would like to volunteer to be the Vote
Administrator, this would be welcomed.  Iain is quite busy and would like to
be able to vote.

Speaking of which, we haven't said whether or not our 'impartial' Vote
Administrator is allowed to vote.  We haven't even said if the Vote
Administrator should be a member as defined by the Constitution.

What do you think?

Regards,
Avery J. Regier
