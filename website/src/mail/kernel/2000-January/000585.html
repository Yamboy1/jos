<PRE>All,

Last night I started looking at what it would take to implement a filesystem
in JJOS.  Stephan Reich in '98 created an API for handling filesystems which
works quite well.  He also wrote a FAT implementation.  Someone was supposed
to write an ext2fs implementation, but it never happened.  There is an a
Medium interface which we'll need to implement which would take care of the
physical writing and reading from disk.

Has anyone thought much about this?  I was looking last night for the EIDE
specification but was unable to find it.  Are there any good sources of
information on how to access disk drives?  Have those of you who looked into
drivers done any research in this area?

- Avery
