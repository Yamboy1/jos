</I>
A &quot;single meta shell&quot; is also known as a window manager, or virtual console
manager. A virtual console manager must intercept keystroke or mouse events
to switch between virtual consoles. A physical console is a limited
resource. There might be only one keyboard, one mouse, one monitor and many
concurrent consoles. Immediately there are two kinds of &quot;consoles&quot;.

 - A real console. This console has direct access to the keyboard, mouse
and video adapter (and monitor).

 - A virtual console. This console has only indirect access to the
keyboard, mouse and video adapter.

The virtual console manager is a third kind of object that fits between a
virtual console and a real console. Many different implementations of a
virtual console manager are possible.

The virtual console manager outputs a copy of a virtual console to the real
console, when a virtual console comes into focus. The virtual console
manager dispatches keystroke and mouse events to one virtual console at a
time. Only one virtual console has &quot;focus&quot;. Since the virtual console
manager is a keystroke event listener, it is the first object to read a
keystroke event. Well-defined keystrokes and/or mouse events are used by
the virtual console manager to change focus.

When a virtual console is constructed, it is isolated and independent from
the virtual console manager. In its lifetime, a virtual console can be
attached and detatched many times to the virtual console manager. A virtual
console is an object that must manage its own character-mapped or
bit-mapped data. (A real console is not required to maintain data beyond
the physical limits of a video adapter.)

The virtual console manager reads the data from a virtual console and
writes it to the real console. Each virtual console has a horizontal and/or
vertical offset, modified by line-up, line-down, page-up, page-down, top
and bottom keys. A virtual console manager might use a horizontal and/or
vertical scroll bar to modify the horizontal/vertical offsets for the
current virtual console.

A virtual console must implement both a console and virtual console
interface. For an example of a mouse-driven, object-oriented,
character-based window manager, see also Turbo Vision for C++/Pascal from
Borland.

-----

All functions of the JCurses library are available indirectly through
setChar() when an escape sequence is defined and implemented. A
&quot;stream&quot;-based console requires a program to use escape sequence to control
the cursor. An escape sequence is a special interpretation of plain text.
This is like HTML and XML, where an escape sequence starts with less-than
(&lt;) and ends with greater-than (&gt;). This is like the old ANSI-terminal
escape sequence, where ESC, [ clears a window. This is like the TELNET
protocol, where 0xFF, 0xF0 clears a window. Through an escape sequence,
colors can be selected and the text cursor moved.

A &quot;stream&quot;-based console is important when implementing a console that's
useful across the network. A socket provides a stream. The setChar() method
would write a character to a stream. A virtual console and its video
adapter do not have to be on the same machine.

A high-level stream console would have additional methods to push standard
escape sequences through the setChar() method.

-----

A shell is not a console, is it? One program might have two or more
simultaneous virtual consoles. While one virtual console shows you the
&quot;normal&quot; program, another might show a trace of program execution. Inside
the clUtilities, there's a demo shell. Inside the Smart API, there are a
few dozen shells.

A &quot;shell&quot; accepts one line of text from standard input stream and
interprets the line of text as a command line. While a shell is a program,
not all programs are shells.

-----

I've been working a long time toward a CommandLineBrowser, a
character-based version of UniversalBrowser. The bulk of these browsers are
identical. The mechanism to get a location from the keyboard is a critical
difference between CommandLineBrowser and UniversalBrowser. While the
AWT-based UniversalBrowser listens for an action event, the
CommandLineBrowser will read one line at a time from standard input,
something like this:

  public void run() {
    DataInputStream input = new DataInputStream( System.in );
    String line;
    for (;;) {
      try {
        line = input.readLine();
      }
      catch( IOException e ) {
        break;
      }
      if ( line == null ) {
        break; // only if redirection (pipe)
      }
      onLocationSelection( line );
    }
  }

Just like the UniversalBrowser, this browser will be URI-based and will
display the content of any file, any web page, any registry-compatible
file, any JDBC connection, and will run any mostly-bytecode program.

A virtual console is a perfect companion to the CommandLineBrowser. The
virtual console would enable me to scroll up and down when a URI produces
more output than fits on a real console. The CommandLineBrowser will call
System.exit() when the given URI is exactly equal to &quot;quit&quot;.
