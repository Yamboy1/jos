<PRE>&gt;<i> 1. in the host build, the method console.setChar seems to not work. I've
</I>&gt;<i> seen several consoleXX.java in host/bytecode/jos/platform/driver, but what
</I>&gt;<i> is the file used in the host build ? (it seems console.java, but i think
</I>&gt;<i> i'm wrong!). Adding setChar should be simple, I think, it would be
</I>&gt;<i> required to add simple lines in jjconsol.c, but i have not understand in
</I>&gt;<i> which way, starting from jos.system.console, we arrive to jjconsol.c.
</I>
	That's because it doesn't.  (I know, I know.)  If you look at the
source for consoled, the initial (native) console is actually a
consoleNative -- this was originally just to maintain compatibility
between host and i386 builds.  So I wrote a very quick and dirty
consoleNative to make things work.  The host build's driver.console class
should (as I mentioned in an earliet email, I believe) be re-written to
use (n)curses pads -- e.g. a whole lot of native code.  (And consoleNative
should be fully fleshed out.)

	consoleNative arrives at jjconsole.cc by a circutious route, where
java.io.PrintStream's printX() methods are over-ridden in native
code.  This native code calls the jjconsole.cc code, which in turns uses
curses to get the work done.  Since jjconsole.cc uses ncurses, get/setX
shouldn't be too hard to write, as you correctly surmised.  The difficulty
will come in deciding and implementing multiple jos consoles.  (Though you
many not need pads to do this; IIRC, there are linux system calls to
generate additional virtual consoles, to which you could switch and just
run a 'stock' consoleNative/jjconsole.cc on.)

&gt;<i> 2. the java.lang.Integer class has some problems, i mean the method
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Integer.parseInt()&quot; seems to not work.
</I>
	This is a known problem, but not one that I've ever isolated.

&gt;<i> 3. what's happened in etherboot image ? after downloading jos-nbi.zip the
</I>&gt;<i> booting station hangs up. I've forgot something or is there a (millennium)
</I>&gt;<i> bug ?
</I>
	The java code is hardcoded for 0xB8000 as the VGA text buffer
address.  Etherboot's native code leaves the buffer at 0xB0000.  I'm not
sure if this is the problem or not -- someone else reported a similar
problem and (and I don't think) has gotten back to us yet.  I'm using
GRUB, which is why the hardcoded 0xB8000 works.
