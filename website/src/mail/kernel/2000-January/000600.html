<PRE>	I committed some stuff to CVS this morning, touching a large
number of files.  A few separate updates went into this commit.  First, a
nearly-functional version of Avery's native &lt;-&gt; java console
bridge.  Currently, it's held up by my mistaken belief that interface
methods could never be native.  (As it turns out, the method listed in
the interface must NOT be native, but the method body in the implementing
class can be anything at all...)  This means that decaf kills the thread
when consoleNative is supposed to do anything because it can't find the
method body.  I'll try to get that fix in tonight.

	Secondly, I fixed the bug Avery uncovered w.r.t. native
methods.  The problem was that we'd never bothered to munge the classname
into the hashtable in which we were storing built-in methods.  This is
fixed in the commit.

	Third, I included my work on a curses-based host build (apparently
and unwittingly in part duplicated by Corrado) -- keystroke-by-keystroke
keyboard driver &amp; the beginnings of a console system.  (Add a native
method to manipulate curses pads to the driver.console class; copy from
the buffer to there, instead of the mappedByteArray, and have update() (or
makeVisible(), etc), call the proper pad to stdscr curses function.)

	As I mentioned above, the commit doesn't work as is; the fix is
relatively simple, though, just change consoled's consoles[0] back to
being a normal console.driver.


	W.r.t. GRUB vs etherbooting, I've only been using GRUB booting for
my recent set of changes, but I'd be very suprised if the etherboot didn't
work.  Once a sufficiently large majority of active developers let me know
that they've got a GRUB boot working, I'll change the Makefile default to
that and stop worrying about etherboot, except for maybe public
releases.  (Whenever /that/ might be.)  The main difference between the
two is where the text-mode VGA buffer is located.  (BTW, the GRUB boot
needs to clear the initial console before doing anything else, because the
GRUB junk on screen makes things hard to read.)  This should be fixable in
the ASM if anyone's willing to try.  ( mov ah, 0x04; int 0x10 might do it,
but check the VGA BIOS specs for the right video mode (80x24 at 0xb8000,
IIRC)).
