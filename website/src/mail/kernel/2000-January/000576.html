<PRE>&gt;<i> I have made a set of changes to the consoles such that F1 is now the 'native'
</I>&gt;<i> console.
</I>
	Hey, good stuff!  I'd been thinking about this but coudn't come up
with an elegant way to do it before I had to move on.  I'll be interested
in seeing your code.  (thanks!)

&gt;<i> My next step is to increase the size of the buffer and somehow figure
</I>&gt;<i> out a way to be able to page up and down on the native console so that
</I>&gt;<i> we can view output that has scrolled out of view.
</I>
	As long as you're adding scrolling/buffering to the native
console, feel free to add it to the virtual consoles, as well :)

&gt;<i> In doing this I also discovered a bug with the decaf native methods.  I had
</I>&gt;<i> made a new class, consoleNative, which implements ConsoleDriver just like
</I>&gt;<i> jos.platform.drivers.console does.
</I>
	BTW -- having worked with this way of doing the drivers/consoles,
do you have any structural-style suggestions?

&gt;<i> In consoleNative, putChar and setChar became native methods.  
</I>&gt;<i> Suddenly, all keyboard input was outputted to the native console
</I>&gt;<i> instead of the java consoles.  What was happenning is that the native
</I>&gt;<i> consoleNative.putChar() was being called where console.putChar() was
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to be called.  I changed consoleNative.putChar() to instead
</I>&gt;<i> call the native consoleNative.putNativeChar() and suddenly everything
</I>&gt;<i> worked.  In short, there is a problem with how decaf resolves if a
</I>&gt;<i> native method is supposed to be used.  I haven't tracked down what
</I>&gt;<i> exactly is happenning yet, but I did leave the debugging messages I
</I>&gt;<i> used to track this down in the code but commented out along with what
</I>&gt;<i> to do in order to show the bug again so that someone can track this
</I>&gt;<i> down later.
</I>
	That is a truly twisted bug, if I understand what you're saying
correctly.  You've got N consoles, where the first one is
driver.consoleNative.  For consoles 1 to N, which are driver.console
instances.  When 1 to N .putChar() is called, decaf calls the
driver.consoleNative.putChar()?  -- That is, decaf called not only the
wrong type of method, but also a method in the wrong class?

&gt;<i> P.S.  I was going to include a patch file with this, but the cvs server is down
</I>&gt;<i> again.  Could someone with access please restart it?  I'll send the patch as
</I>&gt;<i> soon as I see that cvs is up again.  - Thanks.
</I>
	I turned it back on.
