<PRE>Hello all!

It is with great pleasure that i announce to all of you on the arch and
kernel lists that my stab at an IP Stack in Java finally actually does
something. As most of you probably already know UDP is a very simple
protocol built on top of IP, that provides little extra features besided
port numbers and being accessible from userspace. It was therefore not
extremely difficult to implement rudimental UDP into JEPS once i had IP and
ICMP sort of working.

Next i started implementing clones of selected methods of some java.net
classes in order to get sample programs to run on JEPS, and to my surprise
it worked rather well.

Incorporated into release 0.001e of JEPS is the example UDP server program
&quot;QuoteServer&quot;
(<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/networking/datagrams/clientServer.h">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/networking/datagrams/clientServer.h</A>
tml) that replies to UDP packets on a certain port with a quote extracted
from a file, or the current time if this file is unavailable. The
QuoteServerThread class has been modified only slightly to fit into JEPS
and works, as far as have been able to tell, perfectly. 
I urge you all to give it a little more perusal :)

You can get the JEPS Stack's latest version from
<A HREF="http://villa28.cs.kpn.cx/jos/">http://villa28.cs.kpn.cx/jos/</A> as usual, or refer to the TCPIPStack and JEPS
topics on the WIKI-web.
