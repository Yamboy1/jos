<PRE>I just put up the current JEPS code.

It includes a number of improvements in the IP and ARP category as well as
incipient error signalling through exceptions (really needed that!). Please
check it out :)
Plans for the immidiate future are mainly fragmentation and reassembly as
they are a fundamental part of the IP protocol.

I suppose i could move JEPS development onto the CVS in order to be able to
share access with ppl on a more dynamic basis. What do you guys think? How
would i go about in doing this?

How's the progress on native ne2000 drivers coming along? Is anyone
bothering with it yet?
If we get them even half working i'm willing to try the port, just to see
if it works.

I have a good feeling about this .. It might not end up to be the fastest
stack in the block, but  i think we are going to be able to make it
compliant to all the internet host requirements eventually.
