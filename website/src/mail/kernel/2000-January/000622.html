<PRE>Am working on some foundation for network- and other cards.
I'm using a laptop, so I need PCI and PCMCIA support, on which I'm working
on right now. Progress is slow, because of the CVS code I have to compile
(and adjust) over and over again anytime there is an update(Sigh...).
Also the absence of string concatenation is (or was... don't know if it has
been solved yet..) a big problem.

I hope to be of assistance for making ne2000 code for the native builds.

PS.  If we have a poll for netboot/grub., I have to vote for GRUB !!!
PPS. Why has the capitalization of the classnames been altered recently ?
Why not just stick with the 'normal' JAVA naming style
&quot;java.package.ClassName&quot; instead of &quot;java.package.classname&quot; ?


Greetz,

I just put up the current JEPS code.

It includes a number of improvements in the IP and ARP category as well as
incipient error signalling through exceptions (really needed that!). Please
check it out :)
Plans for the immidiate future are mainly fragmentation and reassembly as
they are a fundamental part of the IP protocol.

I suppose i could move JEPS development onto the CVS in order to be able to
share access with ppl on a more dynamic basis. What do you guys think? How
would i go about in doing this?

How's the progress on native ne2000 drivers coming along? Is anyone
bothering with it yet?
If we get them even half working i'm willing to try the port, just to see
if it works.

I have a good feeling about this .. It might not end up to be the fastest
stack in the block, but  i think we are going to be able to make it
compliant to all the internet host requirements eventually.
