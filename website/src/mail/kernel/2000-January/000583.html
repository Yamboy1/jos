<PRE>&gt;<i> I think that the object model for the consoles is fine for the consoles
</I>&gt;<i> themselves, but as soon as we try to add real shells to them, it won't work. 
</I>&gt;<i> There isn't enough flexibility there.  I'll see what I can come up with as I
</I>&gt;<i> continue to work with it.
</I>
	Not enough flexibility?  setChar() would seem to allow you to
build whatever flexibility you might want into a wrapper (text
output-wise).  w.r.t. unix-style piping, a consoleOutputStream class
should be fairly easy to generate, i.e.:

public class consoleOutputStream extends java.io.OutputStream {
	proctected console c;	

	public consoleInputStream( console c ) {
		this.c = c;
		}

	public void write( int b ) {
		c.putChar( (char)b );
		}
	}

and consoleInputStream only slightly more difficult:

public class consoleInputStream extends java.io.InputStream implements KeyListener {
	protected keyboard k;
	protected Queue q;

	public consoleInputStream( keyboard k ) {
		k.addKeyListener( this );
		}

	public int available() { ... }
	public int read() {
		/* Queue's dequeue blocks, waiting
		   for a character from keyTyped() */ 
		q.dequeue();
		}

	... keyTyped( ... ) { ...
		q.enqueue(...);
		}

	}

	Ignoring login for the moment, a shell would be started like so:

keyboard shellK = jos.system.keyboard.getKeyboard();
console shellC = jos.consoled.getCurrentConsole(); /* has matching setCC,
	which also does not exist at the present time */

shell theShell = new some_shell( shellK, shellC );
theShell.start();

/* end of init */

	or, if we're writing the shell as an application (e.g. static
main()), which we should be:

ClassLoader cl = jos.system.proc.getCleanClassLoader();
Class jlSystem = cl.getClass( &quot;java.lang.System&quot; );

jlSystem.setIn( shellK );
jlSystem.setOut( shellC );
jlSystem.setErr( shellC );

jos.system.proc.startProc( cl, cl.getClass( &quot;org.jos.app.shell&quot; ) );

/* end of init */

	-- noting, of course, that jos.system.proc doesn't exist quite yet
:<i>)  (Which also means that the interface sketched out above will probably
</I>change :))

	In either case, the shell could completely ignore the streams
and go to a fully event-based system, where it subscribes on its own to
the keyboard.  (Where an xterminal would add, before startProc():

jsK = cl.getClass( &quot;jos.system.keyboard&quot; );
jsK.setKeyboard( myXKeyboard );

jsCD = cl.getClass( &quot;jos.system.consoled&quot; );
jsCD.setCurrentConsole( this );

so that the correct keyboard/console would be found by the shell.  As an
aside, the shell could provide its own consoled whose console drivers just
use get/setChar on a given othe console and their own buffer -- this would
be suitable generic for any kind of console.  Further thoughts: it might
be worthwhile to move the currentConsole question out of consoled, and/or
extend it in two ways: first, optionally ignore the Fx keys (and/or remap
them), for single console situations; second, provide a class from which
to generate new consoles in init() and/or provide a method
init(console[]), where the initializer provides the desired mix of
consoles.)

	(BTW, aviery, do you have CVS commit privs?)
