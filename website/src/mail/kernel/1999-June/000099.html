<PRE>&gt;<i> All opcodes are now methods on class frame, of the form:
</I>&gt;<i> 	bool frame::opcode(exception_to_throw &amp;);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I made up the exception_to_throw class for a place-holder.  If you have
</I>&gt;<i> a predefined class I should've used instead (I looked but didn't notice
</I>&gt;<i> any obvious candidates), please reply ASAP, and I'll make the global
</I>&gt;<i> change before I commit the sources.  If not, please feel utterly free to
</I>&gt;<i> replace it with whatever you like.
</I>
	I didn't have a class ready, but exception_to_throw is not one of
the prettier (or shorter) class names I've ever come accross :)

&gt;<i> (1) Some poor bastard has got to go and chase around all the PC
</I>&gt;<i> referencing and incrementing, and localize it to each opcode method
</I>&gt;<i> (like we discussed, to enable &quot;backing out&quot; of not (yet) executable
</I>&gt;<i> opcodes, the opcode must not increment the PC unless it worked, and the
</I>&gt;<i> runOpcode demultiplexer must NOT increment the PC).  Although a
</I>&gt;<i> separable task, this is coupled to doing the exception handling.  Please
</I>&gt;<i> advise as to how I should or should not proceed.
</I>
	If the runOpcode demultiplexer can't increment the PC -- which
makes sense -- another nice emacs macro ought to take care of that bit of
the rewrite (thought it means we'll be weeding out myPC--; ... myPC++;
statements for a while!); as for whether or not to proceed, IIRC, you've
got plenty on your plate right now anyway.  I don't know when I'll be
able to resume work on jjos+decaf; probably but not certainly this
weekend, so you're in the clear for big changes.

&gt;<i> (2) I think the various invoke opcodes arguably should each have its own
</I>&gt;<i> method, and the &quot;common&quot; functionality they need should become new
</I>&gt;<i> (protected? private?) methods.  I have this opinion because I think it
</I>&gt;<i> might help readability/maintainability, and it would also certainly help
</I>&gt;<i> efficiency (we probably don't want the execution engine to &quot;forget&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> which invoke opcode it's executing, and have to go back and look it up
</I>&gt;<i> repeatedly, and then set control flags for how many things are on the
</I>&gt;<i> stack, yadda yadda yadda...).  Please advise as to how I should or
</I>&gt;<i> should not proceed.
</I>
	This sounds like a good idea; hopefully it will also eliminate
some of those ugly switch/case statements from the invocation code.  It
might be worthwhile and/or necessary to make more than one protected
helper function, especially if the various invoke-common bits are spread
around and/or throw radically different exceptions.  Again, you've
probably got quite a bit to handle already, but you'll probably get to
this before I do.  

&gt;<i> (4) Please let me know if you ran into the same problems that either
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas or I did with respect to the i386 target.  Thomas, please let me
</I>&gt;<i> know if upgrading to Etherboot 4.2 solved your difficulties as it did
</I>&gt;<i> mine.
</I>
	No.  I tested the second-to-last set of changes I made against the
i386 build (with the full 9.6MB ramdisk) and it worked fine; on the other
hand, the two computers were on a null-ethernet cable, which might have
affected things.  (I couldn't get one to find the other when plugged into
the wall network here; I don't know if that's a problem with Etherboot or
the wall network...)

&gt;<i> (5) I am actually taking the week off from the Day Job, so if there is
</I>&gt;<i> any power-tooling to be done, now is a really, Really, REALLY good
</I>&gt;<i> time.  Please advise.
</I>
	AFAIK, the only  major thing we must get done before we can
integrate classpath is throws.
