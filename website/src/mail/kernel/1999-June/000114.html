</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible to the JavaOS API(s),

I too saw this book.  As far as I can tell it's based on the &quot;JavaOS&quot; used by
IBM in its &quot;JavaOS for Business&quot; product.

I haven't seen any official announcements but it is my impression that this is
now obselete.  Very, very, few systems were shipped and there is no on-going
development.  I haven't read the book or had any direct experience but, again,
it it my impression that this form of JavaOS was a minimal-effort hack
performed solely to get something out into the marketplace so IBM could sell
Java based thin clients (i.e. network computers).

I have a vested interest in operating systems and Java (it's more-or-less what
I do for a living) so I had a fairly good look around JavaOne.  I don't recall
seeing *anything* using this JavaOS.

The current push is for &quot;JavaOS for Consumers&quot; which is Personal Java on top of
ChorusOS.  This is quite a different animal to &quot;JavaOS for Business&quot; and I find
it hard to imagine Sun basing any new JavaOS variants on a different
architecture.  Several vendors were showing Personal Java running on top of
VxWorks and OS-9; these are very similar to JOS4C.

Before cloning the interfaces in your book I recommend you investigate whether
or not they're the same as those used in JOS4C.  Personally I'm not aware of
any published documentation for JOS4C's interfaces (but if you find some, I'm
interested).
