<PRE>Hi guys

I've been following this list with half an ear open, but I'm afraid I don't
have the time to participate. I'm busy working on (as in adding
functionality to) a clean-room JVM that someone else wrote, all written in
C and pretty portable across platforms. I didn't write it, so I can't
answer implementation questions, but I was wondering if maybe you want to
get a copy of the source for reference purposes. It is probably simpler
than other free VMs available, for example the threads aren't native (the
whole machine runs as one process) and there is no JITing. 

There are some issues though, the machine has been modified to support
persistent programming in java, so there is a whole lot of code to fault
objects in and out of a &quot;persistent store&quot;, but you can just ignore that
stuff.

So what I'm saying is, are you interested in the source?

John Leuner
