<PRE>&gt;<i>     I have read the document of JOS Kernel. It seems interesting
</I>&gt;<i> that it boots kernel from BOOTP.
</I>
	This is related to your question below...

	Basically, John Morrison, who wrote the kernel part of JJOS,
decided it would be better to write a kernel that doesn't have its own
bootloader, for several reasons: first, it saved him a lot of time;
second, it would be one less thing to port when we do; third, it meant we
would /have/ to use some standard boot loader; the easiest among those
from a coding standpoint being etherboot, which uses the BOOTP protocol.
	There's been some experimental work done with getting GRUB (the
GRand Unified Bootloader) to load JJOS; Robert Fitzsimmons has reported
success, but I have, as yet, been unable to replicate his work and
integrate the GRUB solution into the build process for the i386 JJOS
target.  This is something you could work on.

&gt;<i>     As Development Plan state, implementation of VGA JJOS are requried. I 
</I>&gt;<i> have interest in developing this. Would u mind let join me in ?
</I>
	We'd be delighted to have you join in.  Right now, I'd guess the
parts necessary for implementing VGA are missing, but they should be added
pretty quickly now that someone (you) has volunteered to write it!  Talk
to John Morrison (<A HREF="mailto:jm@mak.com">jm@mak.com</A>) for more info about this.

&gt;<i>     Also, Is that possible to boot current Kernel from Floppy 
</I>&gt;<i> instead of Ethernet one ?
</I>
	See above.
