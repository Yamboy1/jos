<PRE>Hello Thomas;

Please note that I took the liberty of cc-ing the list, because the
answers to your questions might satisfy some broader interest...

</I>&gt;<i> what is so special about the etherboot package?
</I>
I use Etherboot instead of netboot.  I suppose there is not much
difference (netboot uses (DOS?) &quot;packet mode&quot; drivers -- etherboot uses
its own drivers).  However, Etherboot 4.2 includes netboot 8.81, which
you say doesn't work -- I suppose this is OK because etherboot uses its
own bootloader, not netboot's.

&gt;<i> &gt; The Longer Version: Thomas Bocek just contacted me telling me that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i386 build doesn't work for him, and that he's tracked it down as far
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as: if he allows jbHeap::scrubMemory to scrub between 1MB and 8MB, then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decaf doesn't start.  He's got 64MB DRAM.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I still don't get the point? 1-55MB heap 55-64MB ramdisk. where's the
</I>&gt;<i> code?
</I>
Because one cannot have a program counter (PC) value greater than 1MB
while in x86 &quot;real mode,&quot; the code must be below the 1MB &quot;barrier&quot; --
actually, it's got to be below the 640K frame buffers, too.  (This means
we can avoid a two-stage bootloader, and/or an even more baroque build
process.)  So, the memory map is something like:

10K-200K &quot;nativecode&quot; (200K = current text+data+bss)
200K-600K nativecode stack (stack grows down from 600K)
640K-1MB VGA frame buffer(s)
1MB-54MB C++ heap (really, 10MB less than your max DRAM)
54MB-64MB zipfile-format ramdisk

There are some other things (e.g., bootloader code/data areas, BIOS
code/data ares) that I have omitted (you can find these out from any
decent PC book -- I suggest &quot;The Undocumented PC&quot;), but those are the
jjos+decaf-specific areas.  The other etherboot/netboot specific ones
(e.g., the location of the NBI &quot;directory,&quot; and the command-line args,
and the BOOTP reply) are documented within the etherboot/netboot
documentation.

&gt;<i> &gt; (1) The Etherboot v4.0 floppies don't seem to want to TFTP over the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; entire 9MB (approx) jjos.zip file we create.  I manually deleted sun/*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the zipfile to get the 9MB file down to about 1.5MB, and it loaded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; successfully.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I did exactely the same thing and loaded decaf and found init.class
</I>
Does this mean that you have (at least) a work-around for your problems?

&gt;<i> &gt; (2) When this shrunken jjos.zip was finally ran, it looked like it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stalled after enabling A20, and then said something quickly about the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CPU type, and then it fielded a WHOLE LOT of interrupt zeroes, and then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it just got, real, REAL, quiet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> well, my pc just rebooted.
</I>
When, after it found init.class?  I realize it is hard to catch the text
as it flies by at warp speed, but what's the last thing the computer
printed before it rebooted?

&gt;<i> I downloaded Etherboot 4.2 but what should I upgrade?
</I>
Well, if I understand correctly, you're using netboot rather than
etherboot.  So, I am not sure what the issues are with netboot (as
opposed to etherboot).  If what I've told you previously doesn't help,
I'd be tempted to use Etherboot 4.2 instead of netboot, and see if the
problems go away.

Please Let me know things go.  If the problems don't go away, please let
me know as much detailed information as possible, so I can help as much
as possible (albeit remotely).

Thanks for being so brave to run pre-pre-alpha code!
