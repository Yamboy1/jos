<PRE>	Just thought I'd let people know that I've gotten Java-language
(only) throws working.  I haven't tested the implementation thoroughly,
and I've left some problematic code in (noteably, taking the address of a
reference parameter -- which should be new()d and then free()d in
java_thread but isn't for now); once I clean the code up and do some
more extensive testing, I'll commit it to the CVS.  It's relatively
straightforward code; all the necessary infastructure was already in
place.
	This does /not/ include support for exceptions thrown by native
code, which is by far the more difficult part.  I'll be tackling that
support next, but progress will probably be slow.

	AFAIK, this completes support the non-native, not-class-library
portions of the JVM 1.0.2 specs.  It will be difficult, at best, to test
compliance quite yet because we don't have a fully-functional class
library (i.e. native calls).  However, I will make an effort to comb over
the 1.0.2 JVM spec after I finish exception handling and verify that
everything is coded (not necessarily correctly).
