Based upon a whole 5 seconds of thought, I think you can handle both the &quot;code
itself&quot; and &quot;functions called from w/in runOpcode&quot; cases the same way.  Since
they're (just about) frame methods, you can call a frame/java_thread method to
pop the appropriate stack frames in the classical fashion.  Right?

&gt;<i>         Note that access to a classloader might be problematic as well --
</I>&gt;<i> the JVM needs to generate java_objects to point to for these exceptions,
</I>&gt;<i> though this might be done by some other code than the originator at some
</I>&gt;<i> later point in time.  [A global 'enviroment' table with the
</I>&gt;<i> JVM-generatable exception classes in it?  (which each carry their own
</I>&gt;<i> classloader)]
</I>
Based upon another whole 5 seconds of thought, the only nasty problem I can
think of is (if there is?) an &quot;out of memory&quot; exception (it would Truly Suck to
be out of memory and then have to allocate an &quot;out of memory&quot; exception to
throw).  One might want to have a preallocated exception allocated for that
case.
