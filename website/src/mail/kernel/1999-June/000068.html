</I>&gt;<i> exceptions, that route is closed.
</I>
I'm afraid I don't understand: why can't you just call some sort of member
function like:
	bool frame::throwException(java_object *);
or
	bool java_thread::throwException(java_object *);

It would unwind the frame stack to the &quot;right&quot; frame (based upon either an
explicit exception stack or a traversal of the frames).  frame::runOpcode would
simply return &quot;true&quot; to indicate that the thread should continue execution.  The
next java_thread::runOpcode calls currentFrame()-&gt;runOpcode(), and you get the
&quot;right&quot; frame.  (I'm presuming that exception handlers are simply different PC
locations within a given frame -- right?)  I'm thinking this will All Just Work.

&gt;<i>         Without exceptions, you can pass the thread along, (just modifying
</I>&gt;<i> all the function headers is non-trivial) but the problem
</I>&gt;<i> of returning to the scheduler still exists.*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Based upon another whole 5 seconds of thought, the only nasty problem I can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think of is (if there is?) an &quot;out of memory&quot; exception (it would Truly Suck to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be out of memory and then have to allocate an &quot;out of memory&quot; exception to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; throw).  One might want to have a preallocated exception allocated for that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         Yes.  The problem I was thinking about had more to deal with the
</I>&gt;<i> problem of creating a java instance (i.e. IndexOutOfBoundsException) from
</I>&gt;<i> the nativecode that didn't have access to the classloader.  Though this
</I>&gt;<i> could probably be gotten around.
</I>
I think the java_thread's java_class keeps a reference to its class loader lying
about, although I'll have to check.

&gt;<i> * The only idea that would save me from having to rewrite all the return
</I>&gt;<i> values and function calls would be some bit of (machine?) code that would
</I>&gt;<i> pop the stack until it got back to scheduler, perhaps set at the beginning
</I>&gt;<i> of the runOpcode() call.  But I have no idea how to do this.
</I>
Obviously, I'm hoping we don't need to do this...
