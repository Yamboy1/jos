<PRE>&gt;<i> 1. Is that any discussion are already talking about desiging I/O, Mem in JJOS? What I mean is that,
</I>&gt;<i>     Which Parts of Objects Should be implememted By C, Which Parts of Objects Should be 
</I>&gt;<i>     implememted By Java ?
</I>
	We want to do as much as possible in Java; the specifics are under
discussion on this list; see the thread &quot;alternative approach to memory
classes&quot; for the issues.

&gt;<i> 2. Should Everything use Java to Implement ? or For Hardware Driver, we use C. Except Driver, We use     Java ?
</I>
	Java is used to implement &quot;as much as possible.&quot;  Practically,
that means the kernel and the JVM are written in native code; drivers are
written in Java using native method calls for access to the hardware.

&gt;<i> 3. Is that any works has been started to due with Graphics Adaptor ?
</I>
	Well, JJOS runs in text mode :)  JM is going to write up memory
access classes as soon as the problems raised by question #1 are decided.

&gt;<i> 4. Any standard of Native Implementation of Java in JJOS ?
</I>
	Currently, no.  Eventually, I plan on support JNI.
