<PRE>&gt;<i> (2) implementing something as close as is humanly
</I>&gt;<i> possible to the JavaOS API(s), 
</I>
I would strongly vote for this option. Not only do we
get to use their architecture and hopefully reap
benefits from JavaOS Driver compatibility, but we
will have access to common documentation for the API
(good for our developers, and for users... open
source has always had some difficulty in providing
documentation that's as high quality as their code),
and perhaps more willingness on hardware manufacturer's
part to support such drivers.

&gt;<i> Issue #2:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are there any legal ramifications of cloning the
</I>&gt;<i> JavaOS APIs?  Is
</I>&gt;<i> anybody in a position to find out?  If there are
</I>&gt;<i> issues, I'd sure like
</I>&gt;<i> to know about them right now so that we can do
</I>&gt;<i> option (1) instead...
</I>
If you're taking it from a book (not looking at the
source) I can't see how it would be.  If SUN doesn't
like what you're doing, I'm sure they'll let you know!
