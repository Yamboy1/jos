<PRE>Hi Todd et al;

I am so sorry to be taking so long to finish what I'm doing.

Here's the Short Version:  The opcode-execution global fcns are now frame
methods.  I have neither merged my local mods with Todd's latest committed
changes nor committed my own changes.  Yet.

The Longer Version:

(1) The opcode-execution functions should now be much more efficient (and
significantly simpler to read/understand) as methods of the frame class, in that
they now avoid at least one level of indirection for almost everything they do. 
This actually entailed more extensive mods than I originally thought.

(2) I have made moved duplicative code from the global functions into methods of
the various classes (java_thread, java_class, frame).

(3) I propagated the active thread throughout the class loading, linking,
preparing, and resolving steps because I thought I could, at this stage, and
prior to having native threads, handle this entirely WITHOUT keeping context in
native stacks.  This would enable the scheduler to know which thread was
running, and it would enable a debugger to know, and it would enable pre-emption
of static initializers.  I was wrong, wrong, wrong.  I do not know whether I
should back these changes out, or leave them in (they don't seem to break
anything).

(4) In perusing this machinery, I think there are some further changes I might
like to make with respect to how classes are known to be
resolved/linked/whatever, and, in specific, when the initializer threads get
spawned (right now they get spawned really early, but don't get executed, so
there are a LOT of dormant threads lying about).  I shall discuss these with
Todd after I commit the merged changes.

(5) I need to merge Todd's latest changes in, retest, and then commit.

(6) I have not (cannot?) build the latest Java source successfully.  Todd, would
you please be so kind as to put your latest successful zipfile (compressed, of
course) somewhere I can FTP it from?  Then I can test my merged changes before I
commit them so as not to break anything.  It would also help if you put a
logfile (obviously, host build only) showing me what output to expect.

Thanks,

-jm
