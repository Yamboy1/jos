<PRE>Hi Todd (et al);

The Short Version: I broke apart the monolithic opcode-execution
engine into one method per opcode.  This is preparatory to adding
&quot;throws,&quot; pre-emptible initialization code, etc.

The Longer Version: Files affected are frame.h, interp.cc, and
java_thread.cc.  There are about 250-odd new methods on frame: one per
opcode, and a few helper routines.  Have not yet localized program
counter management into the individual routines (although that's all
set to go now that there *are* individual routines).  STILL have not
gotten around to adding the memory read/write things.  I think I'll do
that before I do the environemnt stuff so that people can write
drivers (I was going to do these in the opposite order, but it's
taking me too long).

Please provide feedback on the code (e.g., &quot;What the Hell were you
SMOKING when you wrote, this, this, ABOMINATION!?!&quot;).  As usual,
please advise me of any problems I have inadvertantly caused (&quot;You,
you, IDIOT!  You broke the Illudium-238 space modulator!  AGAIN!&quot;).
Finally, please let me know of anything I can do to make the code
easier to work on for those hardy, adventurous souls out there.

Thanks,

-jm
