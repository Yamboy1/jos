<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> So what I need is a group of people who can help by
</I>&gt;<i> giving me 
</I>&gt;<i> feedback or by writing some parts of the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation for or with 
</I>&gt;<i> me.  You don't need to be a kernel expert (i'm not)
</I>&gt;<i> to help, it's 
</I>&gt;<i> just common sense.
</I>
A bit of feedback.  I've looked over your interface so
far and it looks good.  I would suggest however that
you reconsider the thread part of the interface.  Many
kernels don't support threads natively and I wonder if
it might be better to try and implement threading in
the jvm rather than the kernel.  If I recall, one of
the goals is to try and keep the kernel as small as
possible and move any other functionality up into
the JVM or higher (allowing them to be written in 
java optimally).  I also see the same issue for the
virtual memory interface.  Much of this is coming from
two OS's I've been looking at lately, RTEMS and QNX.
RTEMS because its a possible kernel target for the
interface, and QNX because I really like their OS
design.  Neither supports threads or virtual memory.

I'd think that the best option is to assume a message
passing micro kernel that only does task switching
(for multi-processing), resource access protection,
and message passing from process to process.  
All other tasks will be handled by the JVM or higher.
This would include threading, virtual memory, and
device drivers (device drivers are simply separate
programs).  This is following from the QNX design.
I'm also assuming that we even want/need 
multi-processing.  In this design, I'd imagine many
aspects of a full JOS system to be running as multiple
processes with full system integration being done
using RMI or jini (using RMI).

In fact, perhaps even resource access protection 
should be moved up into the JVM.

Just some thoughts.
