<PRE>	Monitors &amp; all, decaf &amp; its keyboard driver are on CVS for your
viewing pleasure.  It works, but is mostly incomplete.  (I have a JVM to
work on, all you device-driver people :))

	Things fixed: a nasty bug in invokeinterface (which I think I had
found before and lost in the great refactoring); a nasty bug in
tableswitch (which might mean lookupswitch is also broken, haven't checked
yet); several less-nasty bugs in the Java code; a minor correction to
checkcast ( NULL/null values cast to everything ); other minor fixes en
route.  Made several small changes to make the output prettier.  (Turned
off dot-each-clock printing, interrupt #9 notification, etc.)  Because
decaf still lacks support for exceptions, I had to add some work-around
code for the translation table.

	Known problems: can't get it to boot via GRUB, even w/ robfitz's
patch &amp; makefile.  GRUB complains that it's in an invalid file format.
We're still stuck with EtherBoot for now.  (robfitz, if you could help me
out with this, I'd much appreciate it.  Email me off-list.)  The
jos.system.event.KeyEvent.VK_* constants aren't right, except for VK_A
through VK_Z and VK_1 throught VK_10.  Someone who feels like being
helpful could finish the rest of the mapping.  (Why not use AWT?  Long
story.  Why not copy the source?  Possible legal complications.  Luckily, 
most of it's ASCII... er, unicode.)  I haven't finished porting Albrecht's
code over, so the keyboard doesn't do nifty things like type upper-case
letters :)  Oh -- it only works with standard 102 key keyboards, so if
you've got something funky, write us a driver.

	Let us know if you hit any snags.
