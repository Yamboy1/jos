<PRE>Hi;

It seems that the Java language designers have attempted to achieve
their goal of a &quot;language without sharp edges,&quot; in part, by preventing
Children From Playing With Unsigned Types.

(Q. Can anybody out there name another language that did the same
thing?  One answer is below my signature .. no fair peeking!)

Somewhat obviously, in writing drivers (e.g., VGA), one wishes to
employ unsigned types -- 8-bit and 16-bit for &quot;data,&quot; and (at least)
32-bit for addresses.  (So there -- thhhhbpt!)

Thus, the issue becomes, how to do this in JOS in the most, well,
*palatable* way.  I figure there's one semi-obvious way, and probably
lots of others.  (E.g., how do Java-language network protocol
implementations handle this?  Network protocols are chock *full* of
unsigned quantities.)  Please feel free to reply with candidates
schemes to either me and/or the list.  I am especially interested to
know how JavaOS handles this problem (without, of course, compromising
my &quot;clean room&quot; status).  Obviously, we cannot possibly be the first
people to run across this problem.

Here's one semi-obvious candidate:

(0) Have separate native methods for each and every Java type.
(1) Use Java shorts for reading/writing unsigned 8-bit quantities.
(2) Use Java ints for reading/writing unsigned 16-bit quantities.
(3) Use Java longs for reading/writing unsigned 32-bit
quantities/addresses.
(4) Use atomic operations for all reads/writes.
(5) Build &quot;array&quot; types out of these primitives.

An advantage is that it's pretty straightforward.  Also, the Java
programmer will have control of what kind of memory cycle is generated
(in my limited experience, this is often important to the device being
prodded).  Finally, because we don't synthesize 16-bit operations out
of consecutive 8-bit operations (and likewise 32-bits operations out
16-bit operations), we can get atomic reads and writes (and thus avoid
race conditions).

However, one big drawback (as I see it based on a whole 10 seconds'
thought) is that the address stuff might run like dog-meat --
8bit/16bit stuff should be OK because it fits in one register or
machine-word.

Another big drawback is that we'd basically be throwing bits away when
we cross the boundary into C++/asm from Java (hmm... can we throw an
exception saying &quot;too many bits?&quot; if they're set?), and inventing
(zero-padding) bits on the way back in.

Finally -- don't we have this problem currently with the current
in/out primitives?  (Oh, yeah, and what's the right thing to do with
respect to read-modify-writes?)

Thanks,

-jm
