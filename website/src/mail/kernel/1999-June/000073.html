I think you're thinking of native methods in terms of C code linked in
by Java code via Runtime.loadLibrary()?  As you say, allowing that
sort of thing in JOS is real bad.  The problem with this code is that
is neither &quot;contained&quot; (its C not Java) nor is it trusted (A JOS
kernel writer didn't necessairly write it.)

But, you'll still have native C code that is trusted.  For example,
the code that reads bits off a disk or gets the current time from the
internal clock.  All the native code that implements trusted native
methods.  Hmm, I guess you could write most of those bits in Java...
In any event, that's what I was talking about by native methods that
might want to throw exceptions: e.g., converting errno from a read()
system call into a Java exception.

&gt;<i> didn't you guys retarget Kaffe to your FluxOS toolkit?

Yep.  See <A HREF="http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flux/java/.">http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flux/java/.</A>
