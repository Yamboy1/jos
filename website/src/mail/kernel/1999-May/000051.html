<PRE>Hi Todd (et al);

I am currently trying to move the opcode-execution code to be hanging
off of the frame class rather than hanging about globally.  Part of this
job entails changing some of the existing machinery to be more aware of
which thread it is executing on behalf of (so if there are any
scheduler-related ramifications, we can actually find the thread).  I
have a question:

I am guessing that class_loader::findStaticInit can be called in the
context of any random thread.  I am guessing the findStaticInit tries to
find the static initializers and actually run them.  Here are my
confusions (where the confusion is based both upon a shallow
understanding of Java semantics and a shallow understanding of the code,
with a little bit of Just Plain Wrong potential thrown in for good
measure):

(1) It looks like a new, fresh thread is spawned to run the static
initializers.  However, the thread that caused the classload doesn't
seem to wait for the new thread to finish actually running those
initializers (right?).  This could be bad, right?  (Actually, there seem
to be a couple of multithreading hazards here in specific and in the
class_loader abstraction in general  -- basically, many threads might
share the same classloader -- that might have to be addressed regardless
of the answer to my next question.)  

(2) Is there some reason we don't just run those initializers within the
context of the current (requesting) thread?  Maybe just &quot;push&quot; their
stack frames onto the stack so the vanilla machinery can tackle the
problem?  Is this a Java-ism?  Is there some other advantage to spawning
a new thread?  (It pays to actually understand something before you
attempt to muck with it, eh?)

Thanks for any help/enlightenment you can throw this way!

-jm
