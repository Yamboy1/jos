<PRE>&gt;<i> incremental step is to make it a method on the current frame (it keeps
</I>&gt;<i> peeking to the current frame anyways for just about everything, and this
</I>&gt;<i> will both make the code cleaner and faster by avoiding an unnecessary
</I>&gt;<i> level of indirection).
</I>
	Yup.  Should have thought of that.

&gt;<i> I made the global isParent fcn a method of java_class.
</I>
	It belongs there; I'm not sure why I didn't have it there the
first time.

&gt;<i> I separated out the various invoke opcodes into a function (for
</I>&gt;<i> cleanliness' sake) -- this will be the focus of the &quot;environment&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> effort.
</I>
	Once the &quot;enviroment&quot; for java methods is ready, it should be
nearly trivial to extend to native methods, which will make things much
more efficient.  (And provide an expansion point, if/when we implement
native shared libraries...)

&gt;<i> I think I'll have to make lots of changes to frame and java_thread --
</I>&gt;<i> I'll want to cache the &quot;helper variables&quot; that currently get recomputed
</I>&gt;<i> each bytecode, and I'll want to cache them (probably) on invocations,
</I>&gt;<i> which will mean some code'll have to get divided up and reapportioned
</I>&gt;<i> between the invocation code and the steady-state code.
</I>
	Makes sense.  Many of the things in run() are left over from
before it was made properly re-entrant.

	Out of simple curiosity, I went ahead and let init() finish
executing; memory consumption is down to 1664K, which is a dramatic
improvement over the last time I checked it (~30MB, IIRC).

	I've been working on monitors, mostly.  Slow going; I've been busy
and they aren't particularly simple beasts.  On the other hand, I won't
have to implement anything totally new; all the various subfunctions for
the monitors are already lying around.
