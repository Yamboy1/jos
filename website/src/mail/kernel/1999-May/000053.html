<PRE>&gt;<i> On the other hand, if we get our act totally together with respect to

	Er.  The measurement I'm using doesn't subtract any memory we
might actually be freeing because there's no way to tell how large that
block is.  (Given that jbheap doesn't bother to return freed blocks to the
heap...)  But yes, our ideal number would be zero.

	I don't know what the Party Line is, but my guess is that
(especially because we'll be using separate processes/classloaders) we can
safely ignore the problem of trying to GC static variables.  It's limited
to one process (when that process terminates, its classloader reaps all
its static instances, which are by definition private to the classloader);
and well-behaved java programs* shouldn't have any problem.  And if it's a
process that is designed to never terminate (i.e. init() or a system
daemon), there's no leakage, because the process never terminates: if you
use a static counter on startup but nowhere else, that's your problem --
you use up some extra memory for the lifetime of your process.  The only
way I can see to leak memory (i.e. use more memory the longer it runs)
would be for it to create new classes on the fly (i.e. new Class c =
...;), using 'c' each time, so as to lose the pointer (reference).  This,
of course, leaks the entire Class each time, unless special measures are
taken in the garbage collector -- but it's probably not worth the effort
to take those measures.  A process creating java.lang.Class instances like
that should be killed sooner than later, I'd think.

	I can't imagine a process that would want to do this.  If a
process arranged to stick those static class variables in shared memory
somewhere, they would last until all the processes sharing that memory
died (probably) -- but here we're talking about rather deliberate
malignancies -- and coding techniques that I think we can safely classify
as erroneous and refuse to support.

	Perfect GC is probably not a requirement for this OS anyway.
There are already 'perfect' OSes (OS/370 comes to mind) and fast,
stable, broadly-ported server OSes (Linux, anyone?) that Java is
ill-suited to compete against.  Even supposing we beat Sun at their own
game and get some native-compiling/hot-spot thing to run within 5% of C
code speed, what compelling advantage does reprogramming your server-side
app in Java offer if the one you're already running already runs?

	-- There is the advantage that will do all the sorts of things
that it would be difficult near impossible to do with C; but it seems that
the JOS 'goals' are towards a better *personal* OS, not a better *server*
OS -- the better server OS already being some variant of UNIX; for many of
us, Linux.

	*'properly behaved java programs' -- does anyone know of any kind
of enviroment where java programs are up for long enough and/or under
enough load that the GC becomes an issue in 'system' (JVM) stability?  The
only thing I can think of is servlets, but my (uneducated) impression is
that it's not a big problem to restart them if their JVM dies, and code to
this extent is included in the major servlet-using apps.
