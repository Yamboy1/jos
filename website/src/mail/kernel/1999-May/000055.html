<PRE>Hello Todd

&gt;<i>  Seems to me like the kernel shouldn't be involved in monitors,
</I>&gt;<i> unless you plan to have it support multiple native processes --
</I>&gt;<i> and then the katomic operations would seem to suffice for
</I>&gt;<i> implementing monitors inside the JVM -- where they belong. 
</I>
I can see what you mean.  But I don't think I will remove it.

How I see the kernel interface being used by a jvm developer.  Is 
that the developer will wrap the kernel interface function call into 
a jvm function, with added validation, error checking, debugging, 
etc.  The jvm developer is free to write there own version of a 
function, as long as it is done in a way that won't cause problems 
with other kernels, etc.

&gt;<i>  How will your jos-linux host differ substantially from the 'host'
</I>&gt;<i> build of JJOS?  (From the p.o.v. of decaf, the JVM.)  Or were you
</I>&gt;<i> thinking more broadly, along the lines of kludging something
</I>&gt;<i> together out of other open source projects
</I>&gt;<i> (linux/kaffe/classpath/etc) and write wrappers to this proposed
</I>&gt;<i> standard? 
</I>
I don't think there will be much difference, both would be used as a 
development aid, for testing the jvm, class libraries, etc.

I'm planing on using a linux system to provided the base kernel, 
Japhar as the jvm and maybe using classpath for the class libraries 
(but I don't know yet).

&gt;<i>  I, at least (can't speak for JM), will probably not spend any time
</I>&gt;<i> rewriting decaf/JJOS to match any standard we settle on any time
</I>&gt;<i> soon, for the twin reasons of speed and efficiency.  Speed in
</I>&gt;<i> development has been our goal -- with the end result that I expect
</I>&gt;<i> the keyboard driver (more importantly, the scancode-to-unicode
</I>&gt;<i> converter) to be fully functional before the end of june.
</I>&gt;<i> Efficiency stems from my concerns about trying to set an interface
</I>&gt;<i> for something that (I would guess) none of us have ever done --
</I>&gt;<i> (build) a new kernel.  From my point of view (admittedly, I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> writing the kernel half of things) it would make sense to wait
</I>&gt;<i> until JJOS matured to the point where it wasn't going to be
</I>&gt;<i> changing a whole lot anyway, and /then/ settle on a design,
</I>&gt;<i> applying both our experience in what a kernel needs to do and our
</I>&gt;<i> desires for improvements; refactoring by way of /educated/
</I>&gt;<i> interface design decisions.  This as opposed to continually
</I>&gt;<i> rewriting the interface as new factors came out. 
</I>
Although I haven't look into JJOS/decaf very much, how I would port 
JJOS/decaf to use the kernel interface, is to write a version of JJOS 
that uses the kernel interface internally.  I don't know how hard 
that would be, but it should be possible.
