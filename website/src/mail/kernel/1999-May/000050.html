Matt, Old Buddy, Old Pal!

The Short Version is that (for me) both javac and guavac (under stock
RedHat 6.0), with Sun's JDK1.1.6 in CLASSPATH, both choke trying to
build the stock (as in current CVS version of the java files)
KeyboardInterpreterUSA.  I don't know if it's only VK_ESCAPE, or
everything VK_* therein (haven't had time to play much with it).  If I
yank the JDK out of the CLASSPATH, then they complain about not being
able find java/lang/Object, so I think it's at least being searched.

By the way, when given all the java files at once, guavac prints out
which ones it succeeded on so one can deduce which it's choking on. 
javac simply goes &quot;Tango Uniform.&quot;

Even money is that it's some stupid Pilot Error on my part.

Since I've been futzing about with the guts of the native code, the old
&quot;init&quot; zipfile with the floating pt and double precision tests has been
OK up until this point.  It would be nice to figure this out reasonably
soon, because I'm just about to the point where I'm going to stick in
more &quot;builtin&quot; memory functions so somebody could do a VGA/SVGA driver.

I'd really appreciate any help you can send my way (although, if it
really looks to be Pilot Error on may part, don't feel obligated to
carry on through to the bitter end).

Thanks a ton!

-jm
