<PRE>Hello All;

Sorry for the wide distribution, but, as should become clear from the rest of
this message, we're seeking programming help beyond just the &quot;kernel&quot; group.

In general, I get the feeling that we need to increase the number of people
writing actual code.  I'm sure there are people Out There who want to write
code, but don't know either where or how to jump in.  In specific, as Todd and I
work on jjos+decaf, we sometimes are held up because we have to build some
infrastructure first before building the Java-specific functionality we're
*really* after.

For example, as we think about building some method-lookup machinery for
&quot;built-in&quot; classes, we discovered we could *really* use a good hash-table C++
template.  

If Todd and/or I would put out requests for implementation of reasonably
well-defined pieces of toolsmithing (e.g., &quot;Help! We need a good hashtable
template!&quot;), would anybody Out There be interested in contributing?  

Right now, I can think of two obvious things we need:

(1) The hashtable template, for use with UTF8-&gt;function pointer mappings, and

(2) A Boehm-something-or-other derived conservative garbage collector (I can
provide references and pointers to other implementations).

Please reply either to the various lists or to me personally.

Thanks!

-jm
