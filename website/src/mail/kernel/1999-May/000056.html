<PRE>&gt;<i> How I see the kernel interface being used by a jvm developer.  Is 
</I>&gt;<i> that the developer will wrap the kernel interface function call into 
</I>&gt;<i> a jvm function, with added validation, error checking, debugging, 
</I>&gt;<i> etc.  The jvm developer is free to write there own version of a 
</I>&gt;<i> function, as long as it is done in a way that won't cause problems 
</I>&gt;<i> with other kernels, etc.
</I>
	Okay, I see what you're saying.  Makes sense.

&gt;<i> Although I haven't look into JJOS/decaf very much, how I would port 
</I>&gt;<i> JJOS/decaf to use the kernel interface, is to write a version of JJOS 
</I>&gt;<i> that uses the kernel interface internally.  I don't know how hard 
</I>&gt;<i> that would be, but it should be possible.  
</I>
	I wasn't saying it would be terribly difficult, just a use of time
that could be more profitably spent elsewhere.

	At any rate, I finished decaf's monitors this morning, so things
are proceeding apace.  Next thing on my list is rewriting the current
keyboard driver not to use the AWT, which causes problems calling native
functions.

	Anyway, good luck!
