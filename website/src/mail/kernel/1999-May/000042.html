<PRE>This isn't really JOS kernel related, but I figured you guys may be
interested anyway.  It's about Transmeta, the Santa Clara start-up company
with Paul Allen and Linus Torvalds.  The article seems to have gotten its
data from the Transmeta patent application.

This is a passage from Computer Technology Review, April 1999 Volume XVIIII
Number 4 in an article titled &quot;Stealth Processor&quot;, p. 26, 28, and 47, by
Joshua Piven. (the quote continues until my sig)

...Transmeta's chip, as yet unnamed, will be able to &quot;translate&quot; rather than
emulate code from different operating systems written for other chips...

Transmeta's solution is a chip, which combines a &quot;morph host&quot; and a &quot;code
morphing software,&quot; which create a &quot;microprocessor, which is faster than
microprocessors of the prior art, is capable of running all of the software
for all of the operating systems, which may be run by a large number of
families of prior art microprocessors, yet is less expensive than prior art
microprocessors.&quot;  More specifically, the chip (the morph host) is a
processor, which includes hardware that makes the state of a target
application immediately available when an exception or error occurs, while
the &quot;code morphing software translates the instructions of a target program
to morph host instructions and responds to exceptions and errors by
replacing the working state with the correct target state when necessary so
that correct retranslations occur.&quot;

Transmeta makes the absolutely stunning claim that one version of the chip,
which is designed to run all available x86 applications, includes a morph
host that has just 25 percent of the gates of the Pentium Pro, yet run x86
applications substantially faster than the Pentium Pro - or any other known
microprocessor capable of supporting these applications. (Note that this was
at the time of the patent application.)  In addition, the code morphing
software - combined with the morph host - allows the use of techniques,
which allow the reordering and rescheduling of primitive instructions
generated by a sequence of target instructions, without requiring the
addition of significant circuitry.  Presumably, this will help keep
fabrication costs low.

The chip's morph software includes technology called a &quot;translation buffer,&quot;
which caches host instructions in memory and then allows these instructions
to be recalled: 1) without rerunning the process of determining which
primitive instructions are required to implement each target instruction;
and 2) without addressing and fetching each primitive instruction,
optimizing the sequence of instructions, allocating assets to each
instruction, reordering them, and without executing each step of each
sequence of instructions involved each time each target instruction is
executed.  &quot;Once a target instruction has been translated, it may be
recalled from the translation buffer and executed without the need for any
of these [steps].&quot;

...Transmeta's patent statement ends with this sentence: &quot;Although the
[technology] has been described with relation to the emulation of x86
processors, it should be understood that [it] applies just as well to
programs designed for other processor architectures and programs that
execute on virtual machines, such as P code, Postscript, or Java programs.&quot;
