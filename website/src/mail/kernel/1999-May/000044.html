<PRE>Hi Todd;

I have managed to make run a method on java_thread.  The next
incremental step is to make it a method on the current frame (it keeps
peeking to the current frame anyways for just about everything, and this
will both make the code cleaner and faster by avoiding an unnecessary
level of indirection).  The next incremental step is to make the
&quot;environment&quot; stuff (probably in the class loader, right?) so that
garbage is not produced when the various invoke bytecodes are
encountered.

I made the global isParent fcn a method of java_class.

I removed some trailing &quot;include&quot; directives from header files, and put
them in the (relatively few) cc files that required them for
compilation.

I separated out the various invoke opcodes into a function (for
cleanliness' sake) -- this will be the focus of the &quot;environment&quot;
effort.

I think I'll have to make lots of changes to frame and java_thread --
I'll want to cache the &quot;helper variables&quot; that currently get recomputed
each bytecode, and I'll want to cache them (probably) on invocations,
which will mean some code'll have to get divided up and reapportioned
between the invocation code and the steady-state code.

I will not get to check these in until tonight at the earliest: 
However, here is the list of files that I have mucked about in/with (you
can ignore the Makefile entries):

Gotta run!
