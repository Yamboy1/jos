<PRE>	There would be a great benefit to JNI with ELF libs, I
agree, and it might well be worth doing further down the road, if we get
some sort of dynamic linker (port ld.so?) for jJOS.  I, personally, am not
going to write JNI only for a build which amounts to an emulator.

&gt;<i> Second, while you are rewriting common/decaf from scratch, wouldn't this be
</I>&gt;<i> a good time to implement multiple processes?
</I>
	Yes.  I've been coding with that in mind for long enough that I
neglected to mention it. :)

&gt;<i> My thought is that the ClassLoader approach we previously discussed
</I>&gt;<i> gets the basics, but it would be great to have each process have its
</I>&gt;<i> own heap/stack. (Class definitions would go in a shared heap.)
</I>
	The way I'm looking at it now is to take what JM did in creating a
'JVM' class and run with it, so that you can define a JVM by handing it a
jjmachine object (at some point, we subclass jjmachine for security) and a
classloader.  When you ask that jvm to start, you also hand off a
scheduler on which to run the initial thread.  For now, the schedulers
will all be the same because jJOS is a single process.  Later on,
scheduler could be re-written or subclassed to allow native
threads/processes and/or a mixture of native and green threads/processes.

	The classloader will initially be empty, and fill in its own set
of classes and definitions from the (shared) ramdisk.  I intend to change
this as soon as I verify that they work, and create a system where you can
share as many or as few class definitions as you desire, with each
classloader maintaining its own static data, like .System.in'.  (Although
this will probably start out as an all-or-nothing choice, it makes sense
to be able to have different processes use different definitions of the
same class -- for development work on the editor you're using to do
the development, for instance.  I'm not quite sure what the best way to
handle this is yet.)

&gt;<i> The main advantage of this approach is that we can then detect and/or
</I>&gt;<i> limit how much memory a particular process uses.  For instance, a user
</I>&gt;<i> may want to limit an applet to being able to use only a third of the
</I>&gt;<i> computer's memory at most as a safety precaution.  It is much easier
</I>&gt;<i> to design something like this in at the beginning or during a rewrite
</I>&gt;<i> than to kludge it in later.
</I>
	So you want a model where a process is a classloader (possibly
sharing class definitions with N other classloaders), N &gt;= 1 threads with
independent stacks, and a single independent heap for the process, right?

	Right now, since memory allocation is done by new, all processes
share a single heap.  (One that is logically disjoint except for
situations where a thread specifically exported one its objects to some
other thread.)  According to the spec, individual threads have their own
heap space ('working memory') where they maintain working copies of class
and instance variables (and the elements of those variables if they are
arrays), copies which may differ from another thread's copies until they
are read (at which main memory is directed to update that copy) until the
main memory updates the copy.  That is, it is possible for threads which
are not explicitly synchronized to differ, but it is not required.

	If it is assured that working memory writes and reads are
atomically bound to main-memory stores and loads, then it seems to me that
main and working memory may be identical (that is, at the same
location).  (Although putting them at the same location assures that those
operations are atomic*!  I mean 'may be identical' as in, 'not forbidded
by the Java spec'.)  So it looks like, according to my understanding of
the JVM spec, that a single heap per process is OK.

&gt;<i> How can I best help to implement this during the rewrite?
</I>
	Figure out some elegant way to give each process a private heap,
given that we don't have native processes.  (Implementing native processes
would sure be nice, though, even if we just did cooperative multi-tasking
to ensure the atomicity of a given Java bytecode.  (I'm not sure, but I'd
think that interrupting a thread in the middle of a bytecode might confuse
some other thread that's sharing memory with it.))  Perhaps add an
arbitrary 'heap id' to each jjmachine instance and have me call an
allocator from there?  (a jjmachine subclass containing a pointer to One
True jjmachine that gets to play with the h/w.  allows the start of a
security model, too :))  I might make JVM a superclass of everything that
allocates memory so it automagically knows its heap and its classloader...

* on multiprocessor systems, one may have to manually flush the cache, but
we can call the cache 'working memory' and it's OK not to according to the
spec.
