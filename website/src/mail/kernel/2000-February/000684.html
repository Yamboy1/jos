Thanks, Corrado! I volunteered to make CVS snapshots. Periodic snapshots
are more friendly than anonymous CVS. Members can pick from a short list of
snapshots, independent from the day-to-day activity of CVS. While our HTTP
service is up most the time, we've experienced downtime with our CVS service.

I have the CR/LF problem, too. I have been unable to make jJOS or decaf
from my snapshot of CVS. I am using jCVS, a pure Java application, to
download files from anonymous CVS. jCVS must assume somewhere that I'm
downloading to Windows. In fact, I'm using my Windows box only as a gateway
to the Internet.

1. Can I re-configure jCVS to download properly? This illustrates a
widespread problem with platform dependence in Java. If jCVS depends on
system properties to determine UNIX or DOS mode, it is *not* platform
independent. UNIX or DOS mode should be part of jCVS configuration. I
should be able to use Windows to download from a CVS service to Linux.

2. The snapshot should *always* be distributed in UNIX mode. Is there a
generic tool for converting text files from LF to CR/LF? and from CR/LF to
LF? If we ship the tool with the snapshot, a few might convert from LF to
CF/LF.

3. When it can't handle both LF and CR/LF, the tool is broken. Maybe we
need to find a better version of make, one that is platform-independent.
Compare this to your HTML browser.
