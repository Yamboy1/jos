<PRE>	I use pure virtual classes as if they were Java interfaces.  This
is one technique for maintaining platform independence -- where
platform-specific code is abstracted out the same way a particular
implementation of and algorithm (as represented by a class) is abstracted
out by its public methods.  For this reason -- that the calling code
doesn't know and doesn't care how the work is done -- I tend to code such
that platform-specific code can be #ifdef'd or subclasses as is
appropriate.  For instance -- the code for converting java-byte-order
integers to host order is enscapulated away into JavaWord.  In this case I
believe it is more appropriate for the code to be #ifdef'd than
virtualized, as (a) the host byte order is not going to change while the
program is running and (b) with a class used as often as JavaWord,
overhead is an important consideration.  Furthermore, host order
conversion does not require any significant alteration (none at all, in
fact, in the code, because 'int' is as apropos to the machine, etc) to the
data structures in JavaWord, so virtualizing JavaWord would not deliver
any implementation elegance.

	On the other hand, it may make more sense to virtualize something
like Scheduler, where algorithmic changes OR architecture changes could
cause a modification of the data.  I'm not doing now because none of
Scheduler's data is public.  If I'd provided accessor functions, I might
be a bit more worried (e.g. is the data to which I'm providing access
universal accross every possible implementation?), but I didn't -- add and
removeThread() are effectively a part of the definition of a scheduler, so
I feel no qualms assuming the scheduler will keep track of its threads
somehow :)  However -- if at any time any of my code ought to be
virtualized, and you can convince me so*, I'll be more than happy to take
a replacement, which ought to be able to drop in with only the most
minimal of changes.  (Virtualize the class, move its current
implementation to a default child, add whatever prompted the
virtualization somewhere else; handle picking between the two in the
virtual class. (e.g. Frame::generateFrame(), or any of the points where I
use generate*()** functions, I expect that there may be more than one way
to do things.  If I incorrectly did not expect this for some other class,
the extent of the external changes should be converting a 'new Class()' to
a 'Class::generateClass()' on the right-hand sides.)  Abstraction is my
friend.***

*: I can't think of an example off-hand where hardware requirements force
wildly divergent algorithms/data structures AND that hardware isn't used
often enough that it's worth the overhead to virtualize.  (Or, for that
matter, that it'll be changing during run-time, unless our target
architecture(s) suddenly move into the HA range.)

**: Which, I don't believe, are in the CVS tree quite yet -- I've adopted
them in my rewrite of decaf.

***: Anecdotal proof of this: Having implemented everything but (I
thought) the interpreter and the interrupt-notification part of the
scheduler, I discovered that I had so succesfully abstracted certain parts
of the problem out of the way that I had inadvertently neglected to
implement JavaObject!  I think most of time estimates will come in
correctly because writing the new code the way I am makes it really fast
to get that code done, but spawns two or three new functions to implement,
and so on -- the net amount of work remains the same, but chunks of it are
in different places than I'd thought they'd be.****

****: That led me to following observation: Following the maxim to write
it once to get it done and again to get it done well (or etc) works (for
me, anyway) because the first part builds up and the second builds down --
I start working on the particulars of a given algorithm or data structure
without really being able to see how it fits in, generally, which leads to
grotty code.  The second time you can write things so that they make sense
overall and drop in the algorithms you developed the first time in the
'leaves' of the design -- frequently replacing commented blocks of code
with a function call whose name derives from the comment, as so:

/* This gets the java object which will be running the interrupt handler */
.
.
.
/* now, interruptHandler is set correctly. */

becomes:

JavaObject * interruptHandler = some_abstraction-&gt;getInterruptHandler( interruptNumber)

that is, moving that particular algorithm which had initially thought
belonged where it was used to where it 'belongs.' Then, of course, you get
to write the abstraction and the getInterruptHandler() code, but that
shouldn't be too hard because you can almost cargo-cult program it from
your first try. :)  But what it does, and what it's supposed to do, is
make the algorithms and data structures more elegant.

Hope that wasn't too --pendantic for you. :)
