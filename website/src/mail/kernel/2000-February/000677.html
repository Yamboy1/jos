Yes, I agree. I get tongue-tied trying to talk about it. Resolution goes
into the C++ class representing java.lang.Class. There are at least three
kinds of resolving.

When speaking about a Java class, we could say java.lang.Class. What is
java.lang.Class really? It is a byte array.

There is a C++ class that provides the behavior for java.lang.Class. What
is it called? It is nativeclass, right? There are many instances of
nativeclass, one for each Java class for each process/class loader.

The resolution of a class, field and method should be built into
nativeclass. I thought nativeclass might become completely encapsulated, to
resolve itself when used. The resolveClass() method must be called at the
beginning of each method in nativeclass. Or, like you said, resolveClass()
must be called each time before calling a method in nativeclass.

Resolving a class might throw a java.lang.ClassNotFoundException.

Internal to decaf, there must be a central collection of all bytecode.
Bytecode can be intern'd to eliminate duplicate copies of identical
bytecode. If a constructor to nativeclass accepts a byte array, the
constructor can automatically intern the byte array.

class nativeclass {
  public:
    nativeclass( const void *buffer, size_t size ) {
      payload = internBytecode( buffer, size );
    }
  :
  private:
    const Bytecode *payload;
};

1. Class reference resolution.

At first, a class is just a byte array. The byte array itself is read-only,
immutable, and share-able by all class loaders everywhere. It sounds like
the byte array should be intern'd.

class Bytecode {
  public:
    Bytecode( const void *buffer, size_t size );
    virtual ~Bytecode();

    virtual Access getAccess() const;
    virtual CharBuffer getThisClassSpec() const;
    virtual CharBuffer getSuperClassSpec() const;
    virtual int getInterfaceCount() const;
    virtual CharBuffer getInterfaceSpec( int index ) const;
    virtual int getFieldCount() const;
    virtual Access getFieldAccess( int index ) const;
    virtual CharBuffer getFieldName( int index ) const;
    virtual int getMethodCount() const;
    virtual Access getMethodAccess( int index ) const;
    virtual CharBuffer getMethodName( int index ) const;
    virtual CharBuffer getMethodDescriptor( int index ) const;
    virtual CharBuffer getMethodAttribute( int index ) const;
  :
  private char *payload;
  private size_t size;
};

The Bytecode class holds a byte array. Once an instance of Bytecode is
constructed, it cannot be modified. It is immutable. The byte array comes
from a class file (like java/lang/Object.class). Through its well-defined
methods, the Bytecode class can tell your interpreter anything you want to
know about a class.

All of this has been prototyped in pure reflection
(com.realignsoft.reflection2b) and is available from Smart API - Release 1b.

Whenever a class is used, the class must first determine if it has been
resolved. If a class has not been resolved, it must resolve itself before
performing a request. At the class level, a class is resolved by looking
through its codepool for other classes. Each class entry in codepool is
converted to a pointer to an instance of a C++ object representing a class.

All classes in codepool are resolved at the same time. They are resolved
the first time the class is used. A class knows that it has not been used
when the class lookup table is empty (null).

2. Method reference resolution.

Whenever a method is used, the class must determine if it has ever been
resolved. Has it been used before? A method is resolved by looking up the
native class and looking for its method index.

Each method in codepool has a corresponding data structure:

struct MethodReference {
  NativeClass *nativeClass;
  int methodID;
};

A class has a list of method references. When a method is invoked again,
the method reference is non-null and points directly to the method (bytecode).

3. Field reference resolution.

Fields are like methods. Whenever a field is used, the class must determine
if it has been resolved. Has it been used before? A field is resolved by
looking up the native class and looking for its field index.

Each field in codepool has a corresponding data structure:

struct FieldReference {
  NativeClass *nativeClass;
  int fieldID;
};

A class has a list of field references. When a field is used again, the
field reference is non-null and points directly to the right place (a
native field).
