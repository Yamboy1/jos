<PRE>&gt;<i>(I'm not sure, but I'd think that interrupting a thread in the middle of
</I>&gt;<i>a bytecode might confuse some other thread that's sharing memory with it.)
</I>
Any un-interruptable part of an opcode must be enclosed in a critical
section. Within invokestatic, invokespecial and invokevirtual, the virtual
machine must interrupt a thread in the middle of an opcode. As a
finite-state machine, it is possible to use a critical section to control
preemptive multitasking.

A critical section is a system-wide mechanism. Either task switching is
enabled or disabled by the kernel. Critical sections must be used
sparingly, giving the kernel as many opportunities to task-switch as possible.

In preemptive multitasking, task-switch interrupt is clock-based. It calls
the task switcher periodically. When a task enters a critical section, the
task-switch interrupt is disabled. When a task exits a critical section,
the task-switch interrupt is enabled.

A critical section is much different than a synchronized block. A critical
section disables the task-switching mechanism, so that a task is never
switched in a critical section. A synchronized block is tied to a specific
object and thread; a critical section is system-wide, used by all threads.
If any thread is in a critical section, a task cannot be switched.

Only parts a few opcodes must be enclosed in critical sections.

1. new

From a shared heap, the allocation of a new object might be enclosed in a
critical section.

2. monitorenter/monitorexit

Task switching must never be performed in the middle of
monitorenter/monitorexit.

It does not matter if task switching occurs in the middle of pushing or
popping a variable on the stack frame for a method.

3. garbage collection

Parts of garbage collection must be protected with a critical section. From
a shared heap, the free of an old object might be enclosed in a critical
section.

We should not put an entire opcode in a critical section. We should not by
default make every opcode a critical section.

-----

In non-preemptive multitasking, the task-switch &quot;interrupt&quot; is called at
the whim of the current task. The task-switch method must be written into
the code explicitely. A programmer must determine where it is safe to
switch tasks and add a call to the task-switcher.

This is similar to Thread.yield(). Except in non-preemptive multitasking,
calls to task_yield() are required frequently in your code. A single opcode
might have dozens of calls to task_yield(), giving the task-switcher many
opportunities to switch tasks.

task_yield() must be embedded in the methods of all machine code. It must
be added to each method of a stack frame and object heap. It must be added
frequently to the bytecode interpreter, verifier, resolver and native methods.

In order for non-preemptive multitasking to work, every programmer must
write good code. Every native library must be rewritten to call task_yield().

The &quot;overhead&quot; incurred by calling task_yield() comes from (1) calling it
when the task-switcher is not yet ready to switch tasks, and (2) calling it
long after the task-switcher was ready to switch tasks.

This is the age-old debate between the merits of UNIX vs. MS-DOS and OS/2
vs. Windows 3.1. While it is easier to develop the bulk of an operating
system with non-preemptive multitasking in mind, reality pushes us to build
a preemptive multitasking system eventually. You can't count of every
programmer to write good code. Even system programmers with years of
experience are capable of making a mistake.

-----

I recommend a hybrid between preemptive and non-preemptive multitasking for
JOS because of JOS' special circumstances. I believe jJOS, a kernel, must
use preemptive multitasking (for robustness) and decaf, a virtual machine,
must use non-preemptive multitasking (for simplicity).

Somewhere between jJOS and decaf, it must be possible to create preemptive
threads. This sounds a lot like running decaf on Linux.
