<PRE>	After spending two weeks (or so) trying to get the classpath
native libraries working, I've given up on them, especially since they'd
require JNI, where doing all that work would only help the host build.  So
I decided to just go with their class library, and write the VM-specific
bits directly into decaf, the same way we do native methods now, and leave
porting native-&gt;BCNI/native code to whoever uses it.  (Including myself.)

	So started trying to do that, and quickly ran smack into the
back-end ugliness that I had mentioned wanting to rewrite at some
point.  It may well have been possible to write the VM-specific code
without a rewrite, but it would have been unbelievably ugly -- so I've
started a clean-slate re-write of everything in the common/decaf
directory.  (Since JM's code tends to be much cleaner than mine, and I
don't fully understand great big chunks of it, I'm leaving well-enough in
common/nativecode alone.  I'll re-write whatever chunks of the
arch/*/nativecode stuff seems appropriate, but most of that is in much
better shape than common/decaf, and I don't think much work will be
necessary.)  I should be done with the re-write in less than two weeks,
and the VM work for classpath ought to be done by at most a week later.

	Anyway, my apologies to those of you that have been sitting on
their hands while I've tried to get my act together.
