Excellent! You have organized the JOS architecture into

1. per-thread,
2. per-process, and
3. system-wide.

Your inclusion of a custom class loader to deal with System.exit() is right
on target. Your call for a per-process heap is the right thing to do.

If I read &quot;class file&quot; instead of &quot;class&quot; in the definition of when two
class files are the same, your specification is an excellent place to start.

As you might know, I've been working with package files. A package file
organizes all class files into a single per-package structure. While each
class file is available individually to a virtual machine, space for the
entire package is allocated once. Additional information is inside a
package file so that it is easy to find a class file without reflecting the
class file itself.

To take the virtual machine to the next level, I can imagine 4MB standard
class libraries stored in two dozen package files. Each package file is
loaded into RAM (or virtual RAM) as an entire package, not one class at a
time.

Once an entire package is in RAM, individual classes can be defined on a
per-process basis directly out of the package cache.

When you look at the mechanism of the original defineClass() method, the
offset and length parameters were there for good reason. An archive with
class files from many packages could be loaded into RAM in a single
contiguous block. As individual classes were defined, the offset and length
were needed to pass class files within the block of RAM.

-----

By redefining the findSystemClass() method slightly in
java.lang.ClassLoader, it is possible for a virtual machine to create a new
instance of java.lang.Class from the system-wide class file cache on a
per-process basis. In other words, the key to multiple processes within a
virtual machine is the development of a process-aware findSystemClass().
While a process-agnostic findSystemClass() returns a class from another
process, a process-aware findSystemClass() will return a class on a
per-process basis. Since the process has its own heap, each process must
have its own instance of Runtime and System.

The mechanism to create a new process is much like the java tool. You can
pass a new classpath to a new process. You can pass new properties to a new
process. You can pass new main class and parameters to a new process.

We might support a null class loader for a heavy-weight process. The
virtual machine must determine which heap an object belongs to. An object
must have both a heap property and a class loader property. Each object
must have a reference to the per-process heap that created it.

The &quot;new&quot; opcode must respect the process scheme, so that a new object is
created from the right per-process heap. All of the per-process heaps must
cooperate with a system-wide memory manager.
