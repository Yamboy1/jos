<PRE>	First, a question: someone sent me a large patch to the operation
of jlong a while back, and I wanted it re-written in the same fashion of
jju64.  (E.g. write class jji64, typedef jlong jji64.)  What happened to
this?  (This is part of my 'things to do when I go on and clean up
common/nativecode' list.)

	The current status: another few minutes of work (handling
getRoots() intelligently) and I'll be able to run class-file parsing
tests.  (w00h00!)  Assuming they all pass, it shouldn't take more than
another week to convert interp.cc to the new codebase, at which point (I
hope!) everything will be done.  I probably will not commit at this point,
though, and keep the code for another week or so and write in the minimal
VM-specific native code necessary to support classpath*, and verify that
the java side of classpath works.  (Given that I have yet to find a build
of their native libraries that doesn't dump core immediately on loading,
I'm not too worried about getting the host build ready yet... if anyone
has had luck with this, please send me build/configuration information.  
Thanks.)
	
	Apologies for being so late, but I've been sick recently and
sleeping alot to throw it off.

* If this requires more than a few minutes of coding/architectural
changes, I've blown the rewrite, but I'll let you know if it'll delay
things when I get there.
