The tension between sharing objects and total reclaimation of memory is
another aspect of the persistence barrier. A persistence barrier is
typically a barrier between a dormant object and an active one. A dormant
object exists when all the the electrical power has been turned off. All
domant objects have data and only data (fields). They have no behavior
(methods) because they have no power, no CPU.

We find a persistence barrier between the active CPU and a diskette, hard
drive or CD-ROM. We also find it between two CPUs. The persistence barrier
has been overcome through marshalling an object's data across a
byte-by-byte stream.

When it comes to processes, we want an strong persistence barrier to be
maintained between all processes. Each process must maintain its own
private object graph (sub-heap) and its own garbage collection thread. Two
processes must never share objects. When a process is complete, all of its
objects are destroyed. If the process should fail, it is an important
function of the operating system to insist that all of its objects are
destroyed. An operating system is defective when it enables a process to
leak. An object that is not destroyed by the operating system when a
process is destroyed leaks into a frightful place where total reclaimation
of memory is not possible.

We want a very strong persistence barrier between the kernel process and
other processes. All objects created by a kernel should be destroyed when
the kernel is complete.

And yet, there must be coordination between processes. &quot;Shared memory&quot; is
often managed by a third process. The third process owns the shared memory
and works on behalf of the other two. The persistence barrier has been
bridged successfully by a model of asynchronous I/O. Objects are copied
across a persistence barrier. The third process is often the kernel.

1. Process 1 creates an object. When process 1 is complete, the object dies.

2. Process 1 asks the kernel to clone the object. The kernel (and only the
kernel) creates a copy of the object's data. When the kernel is complete,
space used by this data is reclaimed.

3. Process 2 asks the kernel for a clone of an object. The kernel (and only
the kernel) creates an object from the object's data. The second active
object is just like the original, except it has crossed the persistence
barrier. When process 2 is complete, this copy of the object dies.

At the moment an object is cloned by the kernel, only the object's data is
copied. The object's behavior is not copied. The object's data must not
modified by the kernel while it is in its dormant state. As the copy is
activated, it regains its behavior. It becomes just another object, as if
it were constructed from scratch.

This is something like the old clipboard metaphore. An object in a
clipboard is domant. The object's data must not modified by the clipboard
while it's dormant. In one application, you copy an object to the
system-wide clipboard. From another application, you paste an object from
the system-wide clipboard. Thus, an object can cross the persistence barrier.

The mechanism of getting objects from the kernel has been demonstrated with
the Bytecode Native Interface (BCNI). An object returned from BCNI belongs
to the requesting process. The BCNI typically returns a proxy to objects
owned by the kernel process. The ultimate BCNI plugs into a native method,
leaving the confines of a custom class loader. The JVM implements this one
native method to get JVM-specific objects and proxies from the kernel process.

The persistence barrier is bridged exactly the same way for copying objects
from one process to another as copying objects from one machine to another.
The byte-by-byte asynchronous I/O subsystem works across a network
interface. And the persistence barrier is bridged in the same way for
copying objects from an active process to a diskette, hard drive or CD-ROM.
