<PRE>Hello all!

While working on JEPS i found that there are some pieces of code that seem
to pop up everywhere.
Most prominent examples of this are linked lists of miscelaneous objects
and timers.
I was wondering whether there are plans to share implementations of these
constructs across kernel modules and, if so, how.
We can of course conjure up solutions in an ad-hoc fashion, but that in my
opinion is ugly and error prone.

On another note, to integrate JEPS seamlessly into java.net by using
socketImplFactories, i need to use at least JDK 1.3, as previous version
have no way of setting the factory for DatagramSockets.
I have no idea what the timeline for the 1.3 version is, and how long it
will take for it to go final, but i have a feeling that we are not going to
get the whole project to use 1.3 in a while.
This is why i am thinking of sticking with 1.1 for a while, despite of the
ugly interfacing, at least until the 1.3 is officially released and we
start moving the whole project.
If anyone sees a better alternative, please please tell me! ;)

Ranieri.
