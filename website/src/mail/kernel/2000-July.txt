Subject: [JOS-Kernel] GRUB Booting

I too had problems booting from a GRUB image.  Admittedly, I have
winblows, but GRUB doesn't automatically start the JJOS kernel or
anything.  It just gives me a "grub>" prompt.  I tried using some of the
commands under "help" but to no avail.

Hi Sean --

See http://www.triptych.freeserve.co.uk/grub/index.html for some (admittedly
minimal) notes on GRUB booting. The instructions are for a manual boot --
you have to type the commands each time. You can make GRUB autoboot JOS if
you install it on your hard disk .. you'll have to read the GRUB docs for
how. (No details on my site as I don't really want to take the blame for
stuffing up someone's boot sector ;-)

Your link is broken... at least my DNS server couldn't find it.  Is there
somewhere else to get more info?

Well here's the entry in my grub config file that boots JOS on my box (not
sure how up-to-date this particular version of JOS is though):

title JOS
kernel (hd1,1)/usr/local/jos/GRUB/jos-grub/jjos-grub init
module (hd1,1)/usr/local/jos/GRUB/jos-grub/jjos.zip

"hd1,1" is the second partition on the second drive (dev/hdb2 in Linux).
That and the path to the files would have to be modified.

And again, I don't know how up-to-date my JOS version is; I haven't been
checking anything out of the CVS. The above works with images I got
from somewhere on the web - but I'm not sure where.

Hi

I am interesting in Jos and i have trying to boot it but so far i get 
nothing.

About the help i can give to the project, well
i am interest in OS Core schedelling, memory, storeage management, etc
just the core, but i have only some cncepts, so ... i think i will help
more for now, helping in documentation to see what philosofy is being using

Hi all,

I hope the VM of JOS will handle Threads much faster than the VM of SUN.

When i try to put a Thread in a ThreadGroup or when i change the name of
a Thread, the program hangs for 2 SECONDS!!!!. That's way too long.
Or does it depend on what OS i'm running?

For now, i've removed all the code from my program which alters Threads.

	I'm not sure, and some of the threading stuff is handled by the
class library.  Thanks for the warning, though.

	Which boot method are you trying to use?

	There's not much of an installation process right now, really.  If
you can get JOS up and running, it would be nice if you could write up
some docs about it -- other people are having trouble, too.

PS: if find a document in PS and PDF format about "Techniques for the
design of java operating systems"
by Godmar, Patrick Tuttmann, and other Dep. CS of University of Utah ,

	No, JOS isn't self-booting yet.  You'll need to boot it with
either etherboot or grub.  Both should be listed in freshmeat.  Etherboot
is rather complicated and requires two computers, so I'll give the short
course in GRUB: once it's booted from the floppy, try:

kernel=(N,N)/path/to/jos/arch/i386/nativecode/jjos-grub
module=(N,N)/path/to/jos/arch/i386/bytecode/jjos.zip
boot

where N,N is hd,partition.
