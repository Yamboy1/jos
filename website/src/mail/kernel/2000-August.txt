Subject: [JOS-Kernel] What i've been working on.

Hi All

Well i've been in Chicago for almost six months now, and for four month
I was living in a hotel.  Also for the first month I had no access to
the internet (I don't know how I didn't kill myself ;), and no access to
a computer outside of work.

Since I got my laptop I haven't had access to a second computer to test
with i've been unable to get much work done on RJK, so over the last few
months i've been working on a JVM.

My goals for this JVM are to allow the running of multipule Java
Processes inside the one JVM, share as much class information as possible
between Processes, and be small and fast.

I followed the discussions on the arch mailing list about sharing data
between Processes.  But i'm not sure if I realy like the out come of that
discussion, although I did like some of the ideas.  But i've drawn from
ideas used by lots of JVM, i.e. Japhar, Chives, etc.

My current code base is written in ANSI C and runs on Linux, though this
may change soon.  The code is currently able to parse a classfile into
the internal format used by my JVM, and i'm currently working on having
the Java bytecode converted to native code (ake JIT compiler).

I've been taking my time with this and i've completely rewritten in about
three times so far.  I don't plan to release it yet as I want it to be
able to excute some code first, although previous code bases were able
to interpret some code until they reached a native method.

I also think i'm going to releasing my code under GPL, so if anybody has
a problem with this now would be a good time to discuss it.

Once the JVM is able to excute most code i'll proably go back and work
on RJK.

That about it for the moment.

Subject: [JOS-Kernel] [VM Kit] field list

A field list component is a primative part of a virtual machine. It can
exist outside a virtual machine for extreme testing. In other words, it can
be completely tested /before/ it is integrated into your virtual machine.

A field list is a component of each object. Just as it has a method list,
an object has a field list. A field list can be used to store static fields
for a class and instance fields for an object. And it looks as if the field
list component could be reusable by the stack frame for local variables, too.

A field list allocates room for fields when it is open'd. To initialize a
field list, repeatedly call its addField() method for each field. The
addField() method has a prototype like this:

void FieldList::addField( const char *fieldSpec, const char *descriptor );

where fieldSpec is a full field name (java/lang/System/out) and descriptor
is the field type (Ljava/io/InputStream;).

When open'd, the FieldList also creates a cross-reference index, so that
fields can be addressed by their ID rather than by their name. FieldList
provides a method to get a field ID:

short FieldList::getFieldID( const char *fieldSpec );

To get/set a four-octet field, use

getIntField( short id );
getIntField( const char *fieldSpec );
setIntField( short id, jint v );
setIntField( const char *fieldSpec, jint v );

To get/set an eight-octet field, use

getLongField( short id );
getLongField( const char *fieldSpec );
setLongField( short id, jlong v );
setLongField( const char *fieldSpec, jlong v );

Different field list components are possible. Some might organize fields
into a linked list, an array, or allocate a single block of memory for all
fields in the list.

Subject: [JOS-Kernel] Kernel Compatibility

Hi,
   I have Linux installed on my machines . Can I use the JOS kernel
straight away using my Linux Kernel loader or do I need to explicitly
install JOS.

Thanks
