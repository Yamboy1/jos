<PRE>	First off, please take a look at decaf.cc and see if the assert
style make sense.  (If it does, the NO_ASSERT ifdef's can be changed not
to do anything.)  Specifically, I originally had ASSERT_NOT_NULL as
ASSERT_CONSISTENT; I'm wondering if anyone has a good argument either way.

	This is the first bit of interpreter integration; see the commit
message for more comments.  Most of the integration/porting ought to go
fairly smoothly.  The harder of the tasks I see ahead are as
follows: (1) the other invocation functions (2) invokeNativeMethod()*
(3) handling exceptions properly.  The assertions macros may help with
this.

	I'll take a closer look at rheise.os and review the java processes
discussion before doing much more.

*: invokeNativeMethod(): I'm still debating how to do this.  I need to
look into BCNI (again); I may just write it using the dl* commands
available to the host build** and write a native implementation with
static linkage that uses hashtable lookups.  (With the interning of the
functions is done when the 'library is loaded.')

**: An interesting question now arises.  Assuming we allow user-space
native code, we have to maintain native code separation the same way we do
bytecode for processes, and for the same reason.  (Otherwise, all
nativecode is in the kernel, and since it's statically linked, you have to
restart the kernel if you want to use new native code -- and it's not
a problem to have the native code in one place, ignoring java processes.)
