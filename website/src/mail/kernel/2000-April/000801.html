<PRE>&gt;<i> 1. The code would be cleaner, shorter and more flexible if you used an
</I>&gt;<i> ASSERT macro. For example, I saw a couple of places with this kind of thing:
</I>
	You're right, and I'm amazed I didn't realize this on my
own.  Thanks.

&gt;<i> 2. There seem to be quite a few places where exceptions should be thrown
</I>&gt;<i> (illegal monitor state, out of memory etc) but aren't. I'd be interested in
</I>&gt;<i> trying to help out in this area when the interpreter's up and running.
</I>
	Unfortunately, C++ exceptions aren't supported on the i386 build
yet, so I never gave much thought to them.  They are, clearly, the Right
Way to do things*.  I'll be looking into some static-link fu for
dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;(), so maybe I'll look into exceptions at the same time.**
I don't think, basically, that I should spend time kludging something up
that wouldn't work as well anyway.

	Anyway, I hope you get more time to look at the code; your
comments will be valuable.

*  outline:

decaf_main () {
	try { /* everything before the call that starts the intreperter */ }
	catch ( Exception e ) {
		/* Try to do something intelligent, e.g. a garbage collection
		   and try again; if still no good, abort. */
		}
	scheduler-&gt;start();
	}

Frame::interpret() {
	try { /* switching on the bytecode */ }
	catch ( Exception e ) {
		/* throw e into Java.  (Unless we want try and
		   do something intelligent first.  Exceptions are JavaObject
		   subclasses, so this shouldn't be too hard;
		   return to scheduler after exception-handling frame
		   is on the thread's stack, to be run on the next
		   iteration. */
		}
	}

**: dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;() should be entirely user-space.  Messing about with
the frame stack, etc, may not be, which means it wouldn't work.
