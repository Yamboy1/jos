<PRE>	decaf's bytecode instruction set, excepting monitorenter and
monitorexit, which are only used in explicit synchronized(){} blocks, is
complete.  Large chunks have not been thoroughly tested; in particular,
doubles and longs are known not to work; checkcast and instanceof will
fail on interfaces (probably -- they certainly aren't coded correctly);
the code (lookup and table switch) supporting switch/case statements is
untested and probably chock-full of bugs; the full semantics of any JDK
are not implemented yet; notably, support for the 1.1 inner classes
specification is completely lacking; ditto security concerns, bytecode
verification, and implicit monitor locking.  (Monitors, period, aren't
implemented.)  The Makefile in common/bytecode does NOT build a class
library that decaf can properly exploit; this is lacking in part to
straight-up incompatibilities between decaf and Sun's java interperter,
as well as the abysmal (but present!) support for native methods.  This
list is almost certainly not comprehensive.  Work at your own risk;
cross-check what you can against a known-to-be-behaving JVM.

	Having only recently completed this rounding-out of decaf, and
feeling loathe to test it at this juncture, I examined Matt Albrecht's
code for resource allocation &amp; control and his keyboard driver &amp; scancode
converter, etc.  I'm presenting here a short overview in hopes that Matt
will correct any oversights or misunderstandings of mine before I start
implementing his code for/with decaf; suggestions, based on my current
understandings, are below as well.

In general:

'Device'(s) return 'Driver'(s) via the PrimaryHardwareManager, which is
java object in charge of a particular i/o bus; the Device class/object
returns 'Driver'(s) based on its interactions with the PHM via
'HardwareRequests' of various types.

A 'HardwareResourceInterface' is responsible for implementing the
(presumambly kernel) wrapper of the native code handling a particular
HardwareResource (for the i386, interrupts, ioports, memory, etc;
different architectures will, of course, get their own HardwareResources).

More specifically:

InterruptInterface (and the Driver) model is based on the old,
non-Listener style of things, and hence, must be changed.  The most
obvious question is if the InterruptInterface should be more or less
basically replaced by the InterruptDispatcher or if it should subscribe to
it; especially w.r.t. the IRQResource concept that seems to be Matt's
vehicle for allowing interrupt sharing, which is necessary for a variety
of reasons, not the least of which is the serial port driver.

As far as my stated goal of making jos.system.keyboard as much an
abstraction as possible, and NOT a driver, necessarily, I looked at the
KeyboardDevice class idea; where jos.system.keyboard
would be the default system-wide KeyboardDevice, which hides it back-end
KeyboardInterperter, which could be replaced on the fly.  (For i18n
purposes, one would wonders how non-latin character sets are handled in
the current VK_* system; but since we're almost certain to extend it, that
question can be safely ignored for now.  Something about unicode...
perhaps a unicode character set that defines navigation/function keys?)

The basic idea of the above being that at the level where an application,
including ones like the shell, might get keystoke data, it's safely been
platform de-dependincied ( how does one verb that? ).  It would, of
course, be Good Programming to make the shell independent of the Keyboard
itself, but the telnet daemon feeding the input stream should and could
just as easily feed the stream with the VK_* series we've defined -- as
mapped by its ANSI/vt100/vt220 (etc) termcap-equivalent.

Three questions, perhaps induced by not reading the code closely enough:
first, what use(s) is the DeviceManager intended for?  Second, why have
two ISAKeyboards?  The method overloads don't appear to be necessary or
desirous.  Thirdly, how easy (or difficult) is it for this framework to
handle driver updates on the fly?  I seem to recall several Driver/Device
constructors that took other Devices or Drivers?

At any rate, before I go any further re: this, I want some feedback from
the list; and I will have to build the Makefiles for handling the
architecture-dependent parts of this, so as to get the idea and structure
firmly in place before the driver-writing really gets off the ground.
(i.e. ISAKeyboard is probably an architecture-specific bit of code;
whereas KeyboardDevice probably is not.  This will require a closer
reading of the code.)

As far as things on my todo list aside from the keyboard driver is
rewriting the native-code support in interp.cc to handle argument types,
especially in print() and println(), which will ease the debugging
immensely, as well as lay a groundwork for 'real' native-code handling
later.  The end goal of this, for now, being to make a clean &amp; extensible
keyboard-to-screen echo, and, perhaps, some sort of &quot;hello, world!&quot;-style
shell, to test things out and demonstrate the way it might be done.

And of course, the procession of things which must be done to
bring decaf into full compability w/ the 1.2 JDK.  Does anyone know of a
good compatibility aside from Sun's JCK, which (AFAIK), is not a
particularly cheap (or at-home) kind of thing?
