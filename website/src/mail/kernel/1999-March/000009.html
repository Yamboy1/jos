<PRE>&gt;<i> Before I get started, again good work on the JVM.
</I>
	Thanks.  Assuming all goes well, we should be debugging the
JIT/adaptive compiler this time next year...

&gt;<i> But, geez, a comment on my code?  Even *I* have trouble understanding it at
</I>
	That might explain why I had so many questions :)

&gt;<i> So the reading and interpreting of the keystrokes, and the
</I>&gt;<i> layers of abstraction for the keyboard drivers, is pretty much what I
</I>&gt;<i> currently have in mind as a final cut (pending changes from the group, of
</I>&gt;<i> course).
</I>
	Okay.  I'm curious, though, about the keyboard acknowledge code
you use.  What's the difference between the way I acknowledge the keyboard
(returning a constant 0xAE) and yours (returning the scancode plus/minus
some bitmasks)?  (Since mine seems to work... bearing in mind that my
understanding of keyboard h/w is based on a loose reading of the linux
source.)
 
&gt;<i> The PrimaryHardwareManager doesn't just have to be the i/o bus you're talking
</I>&gt;<i> to - it could be the computer (w/o network) as a whole.  But the idea is the
</I>&gt;<i> same - it passes off requests to allocate every kind of resource to the
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate resource manager.
</I>
	Okay; I think you worded it differently in your docs.  (Although I
suppose one could construe the whole computer as a bus in some virtual
sense.)  The important part of your above statement, then, is that the PHM
is responsible for deciding what's appropriate, right?

&gt;<i> &gt; [HardwareResourceInterface]
</I>&gt;<i> And adding security, so you can't access non-allocated memory, I/O ports,
</I>&gt;<i> whatever.
</I>
	Hm.  Any ideas on how this would be implemented?  (esp. w.r.t. the
java 1.2 security model?)

[ InterruptInterface ]

	I'm not sure what I was thinking here, on further review of the
code.  I probably just didn't write the right class name in due to a brain
skip; but ISAKeyboard2 *does* need to be rewritten -- or, perhaps
preferably, interruptinterface (or whatever the equivalent in the new &amp;
improved system is) accesses the hardware/is accessed by the hardware
correctly.

&gt;<i> That's been the current line of debate (If I follow what you're saying) - how
</I>&gt;<i> to deal with interrupt calls.  We may want to put this in a category of an
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;OS-wide event system&quot;, either asynchronous or synchronous events; that way we
</I>&gt;<i> can expand this idea to an extremely generic fashion, and possibly (much later
</I>&gt;<i> on) include distributable events under this system.  But that's a discussion
</I>&gt;<i> all into itself.
</I>
	I'm thinking now that for all intents and purposes, it truly
doesn't matter how things are actually handled in the resource allocation
system so long as the ResourceInterfaces (or equivalents) hide it away;
we can, therefore, punt on the discussion until such a time that it
becomes important.  Basically, InterruptResourceInterface is directly
equivalent to InterruptDispatcher, if I'm reading the code correctly, in
that it distributes kernel-generated interrupts to the proper listeners.
InterruptResourceInterface handles letting the kernel know where to
dispatch interrupts by a native method register() whereas
InterruptDispatcher is hard-coded into the kernel.  So long as register()
only allows one dispatcher/resource interface, we're fine.  And not having
the interrupt distributor hard-coded is probably the Right Thing to do
anyway.

&gt;<i> &gt; [jos.system.keyboard handles keyboardinterperter]
</I>&gt;<i> That's fine - it would save the users a heck of a lot of time trying to
</I>&gt;<i> remember how to query for the keyboard driver and handle errors, all wrapped
</I>&gt;<i> up in a neat package.
</I>
	That's the idea, alright.  This automagically, BTW, allows for
global shortcut keys, because there's no reason the keyboardinterperter
couldn't generate AWT (or other) events while it's running its merry way
through the decoding.

&gt;<i> Sun says in its KeyEvent file that it retains the right to change the VK_*
</I>&gt;<i> mappings at any time, hence add support for additional keyboards.  So we (in
</I>&gt;<i> our infinite wisdom) could just make a Kernel version of the
</I>&gt;<i> java.awt.events.KeyEvent class without all the awt overhead, which uses our
</I>&gt;<i> own VK_* mappings for any keyboard we come across.
</I>
	It's not so much remapping the VK_* that's a problem as it is the
VK_* concept that would seem to fail when you're talking about languages
where the character set is not the same (much less where the character set
has accents on it!).  Although I suppose there's no reason VK_A couldn't
always map to the first character of a set, one wonders about character
sets with more than 26 letters in their alphabet.  But I suppose that we
(in our infinite wisdom) could retain the right to change the kernel VK_*
mappings at any time as well... anyway, this is a problem I'm more than
happy to punt on.

&gt;<i> That's a double negative - how about &quot;it has safely attained platform
</I>&gt;<i> independance&quot;?
</I>
	grammar should be a four-letter-word, no?  (though I don't think
independence as an 'a' in it...)

&gt;<i> For branching devices.  Mainly for maintenance purposes, so you can clearly
</I>&gt;<i> see under the device configuration &quot;oh, my PCI bus (a DeviceManager) has a
</I>&gt;<i> Modem and a Sound Card (plain Devices, under the DeviceManager)&quot;.  It may not
</I>&gt;<i> be all that important.  My newbetter system under design solves this in a more
</I>&gt;<i> efficient way (and more logically, too).
</I>
	Ah.  Makes sense now.  It seemed to be a rather empty class, and I
suppose that it was.  

&gt;<i> One was the &quot;true&quot; driver using my hardwareResources package, and the other
</I>&gt;<i> used the published driver specs.  That was the only difference, and to show
</I>&gt;<i> just how easy it is to create a device hierarchy with inheritence.
</I>
	I finally figured this out after reading the InterruptInterface
code for the third time.  *sigh*
 
&gt;<i> &gt;  The method overloads don't appear to be necessary or desirous.
</I>&gt;<i> alright.  I'll give you that.
</I>
	And I'll grant you that it did show it was very easy to create
device heirarchy -- had I understood that was the point :)

&gt;<i> Ah, again I aim your attention to the newbetter specs.  I can send you the
</I>&gt;<i> current copy if you missed it the first time through; I'm figuring out the
</I>&gt;<i> specific details now, so it's not complete, but it gives a general overview.
</I>
	You know, I had read them and then completely forgotten about
them, but they do (upon re-reading) seem very well done.  I'm looking
forward to some code.  What kind of time-frame are you looking at?  (There
are any number of things I could do with the kernel depending on how far
away it is; but if it's too far off, I might go ahead and write in a
subset of your work to get the self-hosting stuff started, which is where
things ought to get interesting and start revealing bugs in decaf.)  BTW:
currently inner classes are totally unsupported.  It might be a quick fix
(i.e. read the innerclass attribute) or it might not, depending on what,
exactly, the the innerclass's special 'needs' are.  Reading the section in
the VM spec I've got handy was not particularly illuminating; I'll
probably just have to play around for a while to make sense of it.

&gt;<i> This was the intention - have a generic abstract class to encapsulate the
</I>&gt;<i> generally used functions, then the subclasses (concrete device
</I>&gt;<i> implementations) fill in the architecture-specific parts.  I may have failed
</I>&gt;<i> in a few points, though.
</I>
	I wouldn't worry about it.  My structure comment is more closely
related to how the build tree (i.e. arch/*/bytecode) is setup now than to
how inheritance is or is not implemented.  Having identically-named
but totally different classes in different places in Java is a little bit
of a mindshift.  (Not a large one!  the jb*/jj* convention in JJOS proper
was good preparation and signals how things should probably be done,
which is to say archKeyboard and not ISAKeyboard, though archKeyboard
will probably just redirect to ISAKeyboard except in the presence of the
dread USBKeybord.  But I digress... and it will hopefully not be my
problem anyway!)

	Anyway, thanks for the good feedback and the good work.
