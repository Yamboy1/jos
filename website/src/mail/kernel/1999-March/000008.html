<PRE>Before I get started, again good work on the JVM.

But, geez, a comment on my code?  Even *I* have trouble understanding it at
times.  The purpose was to have a level of security, and PnP resource
allocation all in the same shoe... but I digress.

About the keyboard driver itself - the driver registration and so forth that I
sent you in code, I'm currently redesigning that whole system. But the
interface with the platform services currenlty has no plans for major
modification.  So the reading and interpreting of the keystrokes, and the
layers of abstraction for the keyboard drivers, is pretty much what I
currently have in mind as a final cut (pending changes from the group, of
course).

</I>
I'll try - and possibly show off my misunderstandings too, as well as my
flightiness of mind.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In general:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 'Device'(s) return 'Driver'(s) via the PrimaryHardwareManager, which is
</I>&gt;<i> java object in charge of a particular i/o bus; the Device class/object
</I>&gt;<i> returns 'Driver'(s) based on its interactions with the PHM via
</I>&gt;<i> 'HardwareRequests' of various types.
</I>
The PrimaryHardwareManager doesn't just have to be the i/o bus you're talking
to - it could be the computer (w/o network) as a whole.  But the idea is the
same - it passes off requests to allocate every kind of resource to the
appropriate resource manager.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A 'HardwareResourceInterface' is responsible for implementing the
</I>&gt;<i> (presumambly kernel) wrapper of the native code handling a particular
</I>&gt;<i> HardwareResource (for the i386, interrupts, ioports, memory, etc;
</I>&gt;<i> different architectures will, of course, get their own HardwareResources).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
And adding security, so you can't access non-allocated memory, I/O ports,
whatever.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More specifically:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> InterruptInterface (and the Driver) model is based on the old,
</I>&gt;<i> non-Listener style of things, and hence, must be changed.
</I>
I tried to keep it open, so that some &quot;black box&quot;, either at the kernel level
or wherever, in an event thread or a separate thread, invokes all registered
interrupt handlers (via postEvent() call), which would call the device's
handlers.  So the handlers are a &quot;listener&quot; paradigm - they don't poll for an
interrupt, but rather are only called when an interrupt occurs.  The names I
gave everything probably confuse this, so they should be changed to clear
everything up. (btw - the ISAKeyboardDriver2 follows the design of the
original kernel idea of polling for the interrupts so that you could use it in
your current setup - this may be what you were referring to, but I dunno)

&gt;<i>  The most
</I>&gt;<i> obvious question is if the InterruptInterface should be more or less
</I>&gt;<i> basically replaced by the InterruptDispatcher or if it should subscribe to
</I>&gt;<i> it; especially w.r.t. the IRQResource concept that seems to be Matt's
</I>&gt;<i> vehicle for allowing interrupt sharing, which is necessary for a variety
</I>&gt;<i> of reasons, not the least of which is the serial port driver.
</I>
That's been the current line of debate (If I follow what you're saying) - how
to deal with interrupt calls.  We may want to put this in a category of an
&quot;OS-wide event system&quot;, either asynchronous or synchronous events; that way we
can expand this idea to an extremely generic fashion, and possibly (much later
on) include distributable events under this system.  But that's a discussion
all into itself.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as my stated goal of making jos.system.keyboard as much an
</I>&gt;<i> abstraction as possible, and NOT a driver, necessarily, I looked at the
</I>&gt;<i> KeyboardDevice class idea; where jos.system.keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> would be the default system-wide KeyboardDevice, which hides it back-end
</I>&gt;<i> KeyboardInterperter, which could be replaced on the fly.
</I>
That's fine - it would save the users a heck of a lot of time trying to
remember how to query for the keyboard driver and handle errors, all wrapped
up in a neat package.

&gt;<i>  (For i18n
</I>&gt;<i> purposes, one would wonders how non-latin character sets are handled in
</I>&gt;<i> the current VK_* system; but since we're almost certain to extend it, that
</I>&gt;<i> question can be safely ignored for now.  Something about unicode...
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps a unicode character set that defines navigation/function keys?)
</I>
Sun says in its KeyEvent file that it retains the right to change the VK_*
mappings at any time, hence add support for additional keyboards.  So we (in
our infinite wisdom) could just make a Kernel version of the
java.awt.events.KeyEvent class without all the awt overhead, which uses our
own VK_* mappings for any keyboard we come across.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The basic idea of the above being that at the level where an application,
</I>&gt;<i> including ones like the shell, might get keystoke data, it's safely been
</I>&gt;<i> platform de-dependincied ( how does one verb that? ).
</I>
That's a double negative - how about &quot;it has safely attained platform
independance&quot;?

&gt;<i>  It would, of
</I>&gt;<i> course, be Good Programming to make the shell independent of the Keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> itself, but the telnet daemon feeding the input stream should and could
</I>&gt;<i> just as easily feed the stream with the VK_* series we've defined -- as
</I>&gt;<i> mapped by its ANSI/vt100/vt220 (etc) termcap-equivalent.
</I>
Right - along with the jos.System.keyboard, which returns VK_* key events, we
add on an InputStream interface for it which becomes our java.lang.System.in.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Three questions, perhaps induced by not reading the code closely enough:
</I>&gt;<i> first, what use(s) is the DeviceManager intended for?
</I>
For branching devices.  Mainly for maintenance purposes, so you can clearly
see under the device configuration &quot;oh, my PCI bus (a DeviceManager) has a
Modem and a Sound Card (plain Devices, under the DeviceManager)&quot;.  It may not
be all that important.  My newbetter system under design solves this in a more
efficient way (and more logically, too).

&gt;<i>  Second, why have
</I>&gt;<i> two ISAKeyboards?
</I>
One was the &quot;true&quot; driver using my hardwareResources package, and the other
used the published driver specs.  That was the only difference, and to show
just how easy it is to create a device hierarchy with inheritence.

&gt;<i>  The method overloads don't appear to be necessary or
</I>&gt;<i> desirous.
</I>
alright.  I'll give you that.

&gt;<i>  Thirdly, how easy (or difficult) is it for this framework to
</I>&gt;<i> handle driver updates on the fly?  I seem to recall several Driver/Device
</I>&gt;<i> constructors that took other Devices or Drivers?
</I>
Ah, again I aim your attention to the newbetter specs.  I can send you the
current copy if you missed it the first time through; I'm figuring out the
specific details now, so it's not complete, but it gives a general overview.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At any rate, before I go any further re: this, I want some feedback from
</I>&gt;<i> the list; and I will have to build the Makefiles for handling the
</I>&gt;<i> architecture-dependent parts of this, so as to get the idea and structure
</I>&gt;<i> firmly in place before the driver-writing really gets off the ground.
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. ISAKeyboard is probably an architecture-specific bit of code;
</I>&gt;<i> whereas KeyboardDevice probably is not.  This will require a closer
</I>&gt;<i> reading of the code.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This was the intention - have a generic abstract class to encapsulate the
generally used functions, then the subclasses (concrete device
implementations) fill in the architecture-specific parts.  I may have failed
in a few points, though.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as things on my todo list aside from the keyboard driver is
</I>&gt;<i> rewriting the native-code support in interp.cc to handle argument types,
</I>&gt;<i> especially in print() and println(), which will ease the debugging
</I>&gt;<i> immensely, as well as lay a groundwork for 'real' native-code handling
</I>&gt;<i> later.  The end goal of this, for now, being to make a clean &amp; extensible
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard-to-screen echo, and, perhaps, some sort of &quot;hello, world!&quot;-style
</I>&gt;<i> shell, to test things out and demonstrate the way it might be done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And of course, the procession of things which must be done to
</I>&gt;<i> bring decaf into full compability w/ the 1.2 JDK.  Does anyone know of a
</I>&gt;<i> good compatibility aside from Sun's JCK, which (AFAIK), is not a
</I>&gt;<i> particularly cheap (or at-home) kind of thing?
