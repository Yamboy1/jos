<PRE>[I'm passing this onto the UI guys since it kind of involves them, too]

As I was saying in my other message, buried deep:

I've been giving this some serious consideration.  And here's what I've come
up with:

Have jos.System.keyboard be a system-wide variable implemented the same way
that java.lang.System.in is - in order to change it, you need to call a
special function, which will have security checks to see if the app doing the
call has the right security.  The window manager would replace this with its
own keyboard class, so that it can handle the appropriate focus control.  It
would also add new functions, for say application registration of system-wide
KeyEvent checking.  The original keyboard class would post KeyEvents to all
the manager's &quot;system-wide listeners&quot;, one of which would be the &quot;focus&quot;
listener, which passes the key event on to the current application for
reading, with possible translation if the app requested it.

So in this respect, yes, an addKeyListener() would be a good solution.  All we
need then is a JOS-wide event system to manage acynch events.
