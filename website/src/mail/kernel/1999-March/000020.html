I guess the Linux version works better, as it is faster (doesn't do a read, no bit
masking).

</I>&gt;<i> be the direction you're heading in with the newbetter approach.)
</I>
Ah - now I see that i have not been clear.  Since this the PHM is under the Platform
section, it knows nothing about buses and whatnot (buses are a later abstraction,
technically classified under &quot;driver&quot;).  The &quot;hardware resources&quot; under the Platform
section are things like I/O Addresses, IRQs/Interrupts, DMA channels, and Memory addresses
- the most basic physical hardware available.  These are registered at boot time to
reflect the underlying hardware (most probably under the platform-specialized PHM's static
block).  An i386 system would have I/O Address ranges 0x000 - 0xFFF, interrupts 0 - 255,
DMA channels 0-7, and memory addresses 0x00000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF (physical addresses would
depend on the size of physical memory).

&gt;<i>         Two questions: who decides if the range is valid?
</I>
The HardwareResource in charge of the requested resource.  If the range is invalid, the
request does not go through and an exception is thrown (or a null is returned, whichever).

&gt;<i>  Secondly, are we allowing only certain user's processes to request hardware resources?
</I>&gt;<i> (Probably.  If so, how implement that?  But we can punt on that question
</I>&gt;<i> because we don't have the concept of `users' in JOS yet.  Which will
</I>&gt;<i> probably be another world of pain...)
</I>
Well, first off only JOS aware products could even access them (I hope - O, save Us from
Reflection! :).  We could add to the JOS system a security manager which the PHM could
call for a security violation exception (probably a good idea anyway).  It would be up to
the &quot;main&quot; program to decree the security priveledge of its applications.

&gt;<i>         I think I mentioned this elsewhere: the InterruptInterface becomes
</I>&gt;<i> either a constructor or the primary reciever or &quot;interrupt events.&quot;  (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> either addInterruptListener to jos.system.interruptdispatcher -- which
</I>&gt;<i> should probably be in Machine, but I digress -- or implement
</I>&gt;<i> interruptdispatcher by itself.)
</I>
I was thinking of having InterruptInterface be a receiver for interrupt events.  JavaOS
has a (somewhat) good idea behind this.  They have 3 levels of interrupt handlers.  The
first level is registered as a real-time native code handler (run when the interrupt
happens), second is a deferred native code handler (run in a separate thread from the
interrupt), and the third is a Java-code deferred handler.  I was thinking that we could
have two layers, a real-time and deferred layer - all routines registered can be native or
Java.  This is very run-time specific, of course.


&gt;<i>         We can support support both [native and Java interrupts] also; whether a
</I>&gt;<i> particular
</I>&gt;<i> distribution does or not depends on the philosophical outlook of the
</I>&gt;<i> distributor and/or the necessary effiencies.  (There is a single,
</I>&gt;<i> well-known point where the scheduler considers interrupts.  What various
</I>&gt;<i> coders do with it is up to them.  I would, however, suggest that they
</I>&gt;<i> implement their native drivers as native java methods rather than do
</I>&gt;<i> kernel hacking...)
</I>
Sounds right.  We don't want driver developers releasing kernel patches to use their
drivers (beware of Sun's endless OS patches!).
