wow!

&gt;<i>         Okay.  I'm curious, though, about the keyboard acknowledge code
</I>&gt;<i> you use.  What's the difference between the way I acknowledge the keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> (returning a constant 0xAE) and yours (returning the scancode plus/minus
</I>&gt;<i> some bitmasks)?  (Since mine seems to work... bearing in mind that my
</I>&gt;<i> understanding of keyboard h/w is based on a loose reading of the linux
</I>&gt;<i> source.)
</I>
That's from my old 8086 (XT) DOS keyboard handler code.  It mainly allows for other
programs to mess around with the system settings (write port 61h is used for
keyboard, I/O check enabling, RAM parity check enabling, Read low switches enabling,
and PC Speaker access), while we only change the necessary bits.  The Linux source
probably just sets these settings to what it wants, which is just fine for the AT
system.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The PrimaryHardwareManager doesn't just have to be the i/o bus you're talking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to - it could be the computer (w/o network) as a whole.  But the idea is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same - it passes off requests to allocate every kind of resource to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appropriate resource manager.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Okay; I think you worded it differently in your docs.  (Although I
</I>&gt;<i> suppose one could construe the whole computer as a bus in some virtual
</I>&gt;<i> sense.)  The important part of your above statement, then, is that the PHM
</I>&gt;<i> is responsible for deciding what's appropriate, right?
</I>
Right, in a sense (I just want to make sure that the air is clear here).  The PHM
has several HardwareManagers registered with it, and any requests for a particular
type of hardware get sent off to the HardwareManager that accepts that hardware type
requested.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; [HardwareResourceInterface]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And adding security, so you can't access non-allocated memory, I/O ports,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whatever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Hm.  Any ideas on how this would be implemented?  (esp. w.r.t. the
</I>&gt;<i> java 1.2 security model?)
</I>
As per my code, when an HRI is created, it knows the ranges it was allocated.  Then
on each call, it just checks to see if the requested range was valid.  If not, it
throws a HardwareResourceNotAllocatedException.  This could be too much of an
overhead, though.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [ InterruptInterface ]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I'm not sure what I was thinking here, on further review of the
</I>&gt;<i> code.  I probably just didn't write the right class name in due to a brain
</I>&gt;<i> skip; but ISAKeyboard2 *does* need to be rewritten -- or, perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> preferably, interruptinterface (or whatever the equivalent in the new &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> improved system is) accesses the hardware/is accessed by the hardware
</I>&gt;<i> correctly.
</I>
Ok!  I never was too happy with my interrupt interface code anyway.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;<i> InterruptResourceInterface handles letting the kernel know where to
</I>&gt;<i> dispatch interrupts by a native method register() whereas
</I>&gt;<i> InterruptDispatcher is hard-coded into the kernel.  So long as register()
</I>&gt;<i> only allows one dispatcher/resource interface, we're fine.  And not having
</I>&gt;<i> the interrupt distributor hard-coded is probably the Right Thing to do
</I>&gt;<i> anyway.
</I>
Yup.  BTW - I found the JavaOS book at Barnes &amp; Noble today, and the section on
interrupts describes that JavaOS supports both native and Java interrupt handlers.
Which makes sense, especially with time critical interrupts like USB or whatever.

&gt;<i>         That's the idea, alright.  This automagically, BTW, allows for
</I>&gt;<i> global shortcut keys, because there's no reason the keyboardinterperter
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't generate AWT (or other) events while it's running its merry way
</I>&gt;<i> through the decoding.
</I>
Such as Winblows and OS/2's Ctrl-Esc sequence?  I've been thinking about this - the
keyboard shouldn't be sending out events to every joe shmoe application that
registers an event listener.  That would mean that when you type the letter &quot;a&quot;, 5
applications display the letter &quot;a&quot; in their text box.  The keyboard device should
really restrict who gets actual key events.  Under a GUI, the window manager would
need to replace the jos.system.keyboard for an application such that it only
recieves key events when it has the focus.  This is a tricky spot with big warning
messages flashing in neon.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;<i>         I finally figured this out after reading the InterruptInterface
</I>&gt;<i> code for the third time.  *sigh*
</I>
I *really* need to document my code before I ship it out.  At least have a readme
file to have a general overview of each file and how they work together.  &lt;snicker&gt;
like I'm really going to make documentation! HA!

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;<i> &gt; Ah, again I aim your attention to the newbetter specs.  I can send you the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; current copy if you missed it the first time through; I'm figuring out the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specific details now, so it's not complete, but it gives a general overview.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         You know, I had read them and then completely forgotten about
</I>&gt;<i> them, but they do (upon re-reading) seem very well done.  I'm looking
</I>&gt;<i> forward to some code.  What kind of time-frame are you looking at?
</I>
&lt;agahst&gt; uh, I dunno.  I was kind of figuring on releasing the general idea with
some half-code thrown in.  But I'll see what I can do (It's a huge project if I was
to do it to the hilt).  But I figure that the Platform code I wrote is either going
to stay in the system, or will go to just raw interfaces to native code for speed
and no security (except in the native methods...).  Right now I'm wanting to reuse
the current code and just tweek the interrupt stuff a bit to make it more friendly
(right now, if you let it sniff your hand it will bite you).

&gt;<i>  (There
</I>&gt;<i> are any number of things I could do with the kernel depending on how far
</I>&gt;<i> away it is; but if it's too far off, I might go ahead and write in a
</I>&gt;<i> subset of your work to get the self-hosting stuff started, which is where
</I>&gt;<i> things ought to get interesting and start revealing bugs in decaf.)
</I>
Go for it!

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;<i> which is to say archKeyboard and not ISAKeyboard, though archKeyboard
</I>&gt;<i> will probably just redirect to ISAKeyboard except in the presence of the
</I>&gt;<i> dread USBKeybord.  But I digress... and it will hopefully not be my
</I>&gt;<i> problem anyway!)
</I>
Egads!  USB?  I'll stay away from that until I get some good documentation on the
dread pirate Robertson, er, USB :)  Man, how much coffee have I had today?

&gt;<i>         Anyway, thanks for the good feedback and the good work.
</I>
Thanks - you too.
