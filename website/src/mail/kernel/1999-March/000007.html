<PRE>	How about jos.system.keyboard as a KeyEvent dispatcher (i.e.
jos.system.keyboard.addKeyListener() will do what you'd expect) fed by
whatever we end up naming the keyboard Driver (or Interperter,
depending*) from Albrecht's code, and feeding whatever happens to sign up,
i.e. a shell.  Naturally, since the shell will be signing up as (or be
signed up as) a KeyListener, one would expect that the telnet daemon would
also generate the appropriate KeyEvents, except from its network
connection.

* This depends on whether or not you think that jos.system.keyboard should
distribute key events (AWT or not) of raw scan-codes or of
some-degree-translated scancodes.  I would argue, as a matter of
abstraction, that jos.system.keyboard should distribute KeyEvents of
translated scancodes, up to the point where they are VK_* (or equivalent)
events, but not beyond, i.e. a keyboard interperter would be (should be?)
used to handle things like upper and lower case, control and alt key
commands, key concatenation (i.e. ctrl-e-' to make the accented e
character, etc), and the works.  I suppose one could call this an abstract
raw feeding into an abstract cooker, which in turn would feed the shell.
Things that need finer-grained input or do odd things to the keyboard
(i.e. games) would sign up as KeyListeners on jos.system.keyboard instead
of using the default keyboard interperter(s).
