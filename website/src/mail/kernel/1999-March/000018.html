<PRE>&gt;<i> which is just fine for the AT system.
</I>
	*shrug*  Is one better than the other for the AT?  (As that the
target architecture is i386.)

&gt;<i> Right, in a sense (I just want to make sure that the air is clear here).  The PHM
</I>&gt;<i> has several HardwareManagers registered with it, and any requests for a particular
</I>&gt;<i> type of hardware get sent off to the HardwareManager that accepts that hardware type
</I>&gt;<i> requested.
</I>
	So who's registering the various HardwareManagers?  Other Devices?
(The system builds from the PHM by adding the PCI/ISA/AGP/USB bus devices,
then devices on those busses?  (Although I suppose that PCI, ISA, and AGP
unregister after scanning for devices.  One would expect the PCI bus
to discover other busses like SCSI and FireWire, as well?)  That seems to
be the direction you're heading in with the newbetter approach.)

&gt;<i> As per my code, when an HRI is created, it knows the ranges it was allocated.  Then
</I>&gt;<i> on each call, it just checks to see if the requested range was valid.  If not, it
</I>&gt;<i> throws a HardwareResourceNotAllocatedException.  This could be too much of an
</I>&gt;<i> overhead, though.
</I>
	Two questions: who decides if the range is valid?  Secondly, are
we allowing only certain user's processes to request hardware resources?
(Probably.  If so, how implement that?  But we can punt on that question
because we don't have the concept of `users' in JOS yet.  Which will
probably be another world of pain...)

&gt;<i> Ok!  I never was too happy with my interrupt interface code anyway.
</I>
	I think I mentioned this elsewhere: the InterruptInterface becomes
either a constructor or the primary reciever or &quot;interrupt events.&quot;  (i.e.
either addInterruptListener to jos.system.interruptdispatcher -- which
should probably be in Machine, but I digress -- or implement
interruptdispatcher by itself.)

&gt;<i> Yup.  BTW - I found the JavaOS book at Barnes &amp; Noble today, and the section on
</I>&gt;<i> interrupts describes that JavaOS supports both native and Java interrupt handlers.
</I>&gt;<i> Which makes sense, especially with time critical interrupts like USB or whatever.
</I>
	We can support support both also; whether a particular
distribution does or not depends on the philosophical outlook of the
distributor and/or the necessary effiencies.  (There is a single,
well-known point where the scheduler considers interrupts.  What various
coders do with it is up to them.  I would, however, suggest that they
implement their native drivers as native java methods rather than do
kernel hacking...)

&gt;<i> Such as Winblows and OS/2's Ctrl-Esc sequence?  I've been thinking about this - the
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard shouldn't be sending out events to every joe shmoe application that
</I>&gt;<i> registers an event listener.  That would mean that when you type the letter &quot;a&quot;, 5
</I>&gt;<i> applications display the letter &quot;a&quot; in their text box.  The keyboard device should
</I>&gt;<i> really restrict who gets actual key events.  Under a GUI, the window manager would
</I>&gt;<i> need to replace the jos.system.keyboard for an application such that it only
</I>&gt;<i> recieves key events when it has the focus.  This is a tricky spot with big warning
</I>&gt;<i> messages flashing in neon.
</I>
	Yeah.  See my rather lengthy response to your other post.
