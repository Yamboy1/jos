<PRE>&gt;<i> - What is the meaning of JJOS?
</I>
	JJOS is a kernel under development by John Morrison (<A HREF="mailto:jm@mak.com">jm@mak.com</A>)
for use by the JOS project.  decaf (see below) is built on JJOS, which
currently has two targets: one the i386 build, the other a 'host' build
for running under Linux, to assist in debugging.

&gt;<i> - What is the meaning of CVS?
</I>
	The Concurrent Versioning System.  It's a way of making the
computer(s) keep track of the changes that various different authors are
making to the source, and then merging them.  I don't have any web
references handy, though a search on yahoo (or your engine of choice)
should turn up plenty of references.

&gt;<i> - What is the meaning of decaf?
</I>
	decaf is the Java Virtual Machine I'm writing for JOS, the one
that runs on JJOS.  The name is a rather obvious coffee reference, as well
as a marketing device.  (i.e.: the slogan is &quot;decaf -- it helps you get
your z's&quot;; we use the IBM ad where the sysadmin is woken up at 3am in
Paris -- except our sysadmin doesn't get woken up because he's running
jos.  Hence: decaf helps you get your z's.)

&gt;<i> - Waht is the meaning of RCS?
</I>
	Revision Control System.  The local version of CVS; is used by
some versions earlier versions of CVS to handle the change merges.
