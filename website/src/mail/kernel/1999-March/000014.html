<PRE>Hello Peter

&gt;<i> I'm new on Jos. And i'm very intressted to help with JOS. But
</I>&gt;<i> firstable I have some questions:
</I>
&gt;<i> - What is the meaning of JJOS? 
</I>
JJOS is a kernel being mainly developed by John Morrison.  It is 
written in C++, with some parts written in NASM assembly.  At the 
moment JJOS boots using etherboot, which requires that you have two 
computer networked together.  There is also a Linux host where you 
run JJOS from within Linux.  And I have been working on getting JJOS 
to boot from a disk drive using GRUB.

&gt;<i> - What is the meaning of CVS?
</I>
CVS (Concurrent Versions System) is a client/server version control 
system.  It allows access to multiple files and allows multiple 
developers to be working on the same files.  Have a look at 
<A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/">http://www.cyclic.com/</A> for more information.

&gt;<i> - What is the meaning of decaf?
</I>
decaf is a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) being mainly developed by Todd 
Miller (aka _Quinn).  decaf is integrated with JJOS, so it is also 
written in C++.  It is an interpreter based JVM, and I believe that 
it can interpreter most of the Java bytecodes.

&gt;<i> - Waht is the meaning of RCS?
</I>
RCS (Revision Control System) is a file based version control system.
I haven't used this, but I do know that files have to be locked and 
accessed individually making it a lot more complicated to use 
compared to CVS.

Hope this helps.

PS, if I have anything wrong about JJOS or decaf,  John, Todd please 
correct me.
