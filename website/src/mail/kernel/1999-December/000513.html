Subject: [JOS-Arch] [DistributionGroup] Planning for next release

Let's think about the next distribution of JOS.

When the kernel group reaches a concensus that jJOS is GRUB-bootable, it
gives us an opportunity to create the next distribution of JOS.

...

We also need to refine the definition of a technical distribution. A
technical distribution requires Linux (doesn't it?). A technical
distribution includes tools (or links to tools) so that you can (re)build
the JOS runtime distribution from the JOS source distribution. Are there
new tools required to build JOS? The tools.tgz archive does not include
GRUB and other tools recently mentioned by the kernel group. And yet, a
GRUB-bootable runtime edition needs something from GRUB.

_________________________

	Anyone having any luck with booting jJOS from GRUB?  (I can boot
it, but it dies almost immediately with a corrupt VM error.  I suspect
this is a timing problem with respect to static initialization, but I
could be wrong -- I haven't looked into it, because I'm running it with
the new interrupt code currently.)

	The current tool chain is NASM and one of etherboot+mknbi-jos and
GRUB, right?  Where GRUB can be distributed as that pair of images (or a
single floppy image) that George has lying around, right?  (I.E. no need
for a source distribution for the 'runtime' version.)  Repackacking this
would just split NASM off from etherboot+mknbi-jos and package up GRUB.
