<PRE>	The field lookup code had a serious bug in it which prevent it
from working with jikes-compiled code, where it would not check
super-interfaces or super-classes for fields because javac always pointed
the field reference's class pointer at the proper class (i.e. the
super-class / super-interface in which that field resides).  I've fixed
this, but haven't committed it to CVS yet, in search of the other bug,
where the constant pool is being asked for an entry it doesn't have --
which might be masking whatever bad coding I may have done fixing the
lookup code.

	I tested with both jikes and javac, so I don't think the incorrect
offset is a problem in the compiler, though I can't imagine what it's
actually useful for.  The solution I came up with -- because I don't have
the slightest idea what I'm doing wrong -- was just to skip the part of
the code in ur_java_class.cc that attempts to verify that the give
interface method does, in fact, exist.  I'm guessing that the indices are
offsets into the super class's constant pool, but it's been long enough
since I've worked on the back-end code that I'm not entirely
sure.  dynLink() (interp.cc) seems to treating things that way...

	At any rate, something in one of the initializations classpath put
in its java code is trying to load libraries, etc, and because that
particular chunk of native code isn't implemented yet, I think I'm
returning a NULL object to the stack -- causing the current status of a
segfault.  I think, however, that the missing functions will be relatively
easy to insert.  Before I do, however, I want to check just what exactly
is going on in the code and make sure that I want it to be happening.

	For now, however, fast native code is off (on my build), and
classpath is being checked before decaf for native methods.* This will
probably change to allow us to bypass unimplemented bits.**

*: And failing, because the library loading fails on the
'LINK_ReallyLinkKnownClass' symbol not being found.  I suspect that this
is in the JNI somewhere.

**: What I want to happen is to move to -DFAST_NATIVE_CODE, and change the
classpath sources to mark those methods we're currently over-riding as
native.  There should be a relatively straight-forward set of
modifications to allow us to compile jvmbuiltins.cc as a
dynamically-linked library, and end up treating it just like classpath's
various libs.  (Back-end would probably just be shared with the
loadlibrary code -- that is, a list of lib handles in which to check for
the native code.  We'll see.)

PS: As the above two footnotes show, aside from JNI, the host build is
very close to gaining classpath, which provides it with a fully-functional
(AFAIK, this is true for 1.1 but not 1.2) class library amenable to our
modifications.  This would be a substantial jump forward in functionality
for decaf.

(As an aside, I think we're going to have to fork classpath and set it up
in our own CVS.  The host build should remain very similar, except for the
native-marked decaf-over-ridden methods which we'll aim to remove.  The
i38 build, on the other hand, is going to require, I think, some
substantial revision, if for no other reason than the limitations of the
'standard library' for the host build.  Some of these changes will take
place internal to decaf -- a larger 'stdlib' and changes from dynamic to
static linking/loading (no ld.so from JJOS!), etc -- but at the very least
we'll need to write our own JVM-specific classes.  (classpath/vm).  This
does not consider other possibilites like BCNI and/or multiple processes.  
I will, of course, keep this list closely informed about my progress and
the magnitude of the required changes to classpath.  If they look minor
enough -- and BCNI, etc, are similarly minor -- we may be able to get by
with a --with-decaf flag to ./configure and a CVS branch.  We'll see.)

	Additionally, some i386-build drivers may be able to be
implemented for the host.  The console driver(s) come to mind as being
ready for a jcurses back-end; or one might be able to use the ncurses
library directly and get better keyboard-handling for the keyboard driver
in the deal.  The VGA console/driver should be relatively simple to
implement on the AWT or in an X-window.

	Something I do want to when decaf+classpath is functional is to
run a benchmark (caffienemark?) against java and japhar+classpath, just to
see how much work I need to do... :)
