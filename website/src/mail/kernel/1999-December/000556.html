<PRE>[Warning, this is pretty long]

Most of you on this list probably recall some of my earlier postings on
some stuff I've been doing with Utah's OSKit and a JVM that I'm working
on. 

For those who don't know about it, this is what I'm doing:

I have a JVM written by a grad student at my university, it's written in C
and is intended to be quite portable. I have spent some time recently
integrating it with Classpath (the project making free java class
libraries) and currently have things like file and network io working ok
with it. Other features are a working tracing (sweep and compact) gc and
an implementation of the JNI. 

The move to classpath brings in support for most JDK 1.1 things, and
allows a lot of work to be saved in doing things like internationalization
etc.

I have taken this JVM and converted it (slightly) to boot as a kernel with
the OSKit. The OSKit is a large collection of modularized components
useful for building operating systems. For example I use a C library,
network device driver code, file system code, network tcp/ip stack, math
library, memory manager etc from the standard OSKit build without any
changes whatsoever. 

The result is a 'kernel' that boots from a Multiboot compliant loader (eg
GRUB) or the OSKit's netboot. Currently the OSKit does all the hardware
related stuff, it handles interrupts, sets up the hardware, provides
console support etc. 

My experiments so far have allowed me to run simple java apps on this
kernel (the kernel is about 700k). You need to provide the class libraries
too, so one option is to include these in the boot image, but this posed a
problem with size (the libraries are several megabytes). It takes too long
to boot the kernel, so I wrote a very simple HTTP loader that just asks my
linux machine running apache for the class files. Then what I do is make a
barebones zip file containing the most commonly used class files (for
running a helloworld program for example) which comes to 150k and put this
in the boot image. 

This system works pretty well, recently I have tried out once again Thomas
Bocek's VGA driver, which works good, but seems to be slow for me
to start writing a window manager / graphical framework (which I would
like to do). 

One of the biggest issues facing the JVM is IO. Currently it doesn't use
native threads, it just emulates threading by using every instruction
executed as a clock tick. This means that anything that does file IO,
including a socket accept call, will block until the IO is finished. 

Changes to the VM to do real IO will be tricky. One option is to keep IO
state for each thread and do asynchronous calls while pretending to block.
Another option is to implement the VM with native threads and let the OS
underneath take care of this. 

But the problem is that when you're building your OS on the VM, you don't
know what's going to be underneath (a microkernel? Real context-switching
like UNIX with multiple address spaces? A single address space single
thread model?).

So I'm curious to know what you guys plan for handling this sort of issue,
what are the current plans for a memory and threading model?

If anyone wants to look at what I have running you'll need a linux machine
running NFS and Dhcp, and another machine connected via a network.
Software needed is normal gcc and the OSKit distribution. I will probably
make a tarball available some time. 

I have spent quite a while looking at classpath and figuring out how to
support it (although I still intend to get more thoroughly acquainted with
it), so I'm willing to help out when you guys get to that stage.
