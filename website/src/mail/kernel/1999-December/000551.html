<PRE>I have a few more questions.

What is the current plan to test decaf for full implementation of the
java.* packages? Is there a check-list? In other words, when will we know
when decaf is done?

-----

Where the subroutines from C standard library declared? defined?

memcpy()
newStr()
alloc()
free()
strcpy()
strcat()

If subroutines from the standard library are not available in decaf, we
should declare only the subroutines that are defined. We need new header
files, like josstdio.h, josstdlib.h, etc.

A #define might make it easier to write C code:

#ifdef Uses_JOSStandardLibrary
#define memcpy jos_memcpy
#define strcpy jos_strcpy
#endif

-----

What would happen if I compiled decaf into a standard shared library
(libdecaf.so.#)? Could I use decaf in other Linux programs?

-----

I have been unable to compile bytecode on my Linux server.

I downloaded JDK 1.1.6 v5 from blackdown, but all JDK tools abort with the
following message:

can't load library 'libXpm.so.4'

Question 1. Where do I get libXpm.so.4?

All the programs I want to run on my Linux server are TCP/IP daemons --
completely free of a GUI such as AWT or Swing. So why do I even need
libXpm.so.4?

Question 2. Does anyone have an open-source example of dynamic shared
libraries on Linux?

Linux shared libraries seem to have two mechanisms. The first is the
compile-time reference to a library, where a program depends on a shared
library. This is also known as a overlay. It is automatic. The shared
library is required for a program to run.

The second is the runtime reference to a library, where a program is aware
of, but not dependent on a shared library. This is also known as a dynamic
link library. A dynamically linked shared library is similar to the
loadLibrary() method from Java class libraries. How is this method
implemented on Linux?

loadLibrary( &quot;lib-name&quot; );

For example, I would like to display a plain-English message when someone
runs my program prior to installing libdecaf.so.#. I would like my program
to keep on running, too.
