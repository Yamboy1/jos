<PRE>Hello all,

First, I'm moving this discussion over to the admin list.  Please 
direct your followups there.

I think it looks really nice too.  There are many things that still 
need to be worked on (that's why its still a 0.x release) but there's 
a lot of power already in place, and many promising developments 
on the way.  Definitely something we should keep our eyes on.  
For JOS, I see two potential stumbling blocks. 

First, we'll need to get the wiki ported in order to move the entire 
site over to sourceforge.  We certainly can just host what 
sourceforge offers (CVS, ftp, etc) at sourceforge and keep the wiki 
on a separate server.  However, linking everything together with a 
single user id would make it worth it to port.  The main impediment 
to this right now is sourceforge is very new, and they haven't 
designed a way for us to access the session and user login 
information from sourceforge accounts yet.  It's on their &quot;to do&quot; list 
though.  I've been following the discussion and will try and stay up 
to date on this feature.

Second, sourceforge is designed to host a group of single product 
projects.  We actually should try setting up a separate sourceforge 
system for jos, where the projects in the JOSSourceForge are all 
related to JOS.  This should be possible when sourceforge 
releases their source (which, from the discussions on their site, 
should be &quot;real soon now&quot;).  

The advantages being, a nice, tight integration of JOS and its 
applications.  The disadvantages being we have to setup and 
maintain a sourceforge clone.  I like this solution best though as 
we can perhaps do some fund raising with such a site (advertizing 
or becoming amazon.com resellers) to help offset some of the 
costs JOS members are currently shouldering.

The alternative is porting wiki to work in sourceforge, and using 
sourceforge as hosted at valinux.  This way, va linux shoulders the 
costs and pain of setting up and maintaining the site.  We then let 
all the jos projects basically splinter and form their own little 
sourceforge projects and then do something like a web ring to link 
them all under the JOS &quot;umbrella&quot;.  A lot less work and will get 
things done sooner rather than later.  It seems like an &quot;ugly&quot; 
solution though.

Are there other alternatives I'm not seeing?  

Oh, and this is not to say sourceforge is THE solution, but we 
basically have to do something like a SourceForge on our own (the 
self hosting option) or try and use someone else's free/inexpensive 
service (the &quot;use SourceForge&quot; option).  There are other services 
like SourceForge out there... but none that I've seen so far that look 
as promising.

I was working on my own version of a site like SourceForge for the 
next version of the JOS website, but now that I've seen what 
SourceForge does (which is almost exactly what I had in mind 
anyhow) I'm thinking that one way or the other, we might as well 
use SourceForge (either on our own site or using their service).  
Opinions?
