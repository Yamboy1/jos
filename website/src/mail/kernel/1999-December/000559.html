<PRE>Hi,
I have just recently signed up for this, the architecture list and the
gui discussion list.  I just had a few quick questions and a quick
intro.

My name is Warner Onstine, I am currently head of web-development at
eblox.com, I have also been working on the freebuilder project for a
number of years.  I have been watching jos for quite some time and have
recently decided to devote some free time to the project.  My interest
lies in OS construction/kernels etc.  In addition to the User Interface
discussion.

So, here is my quick question?  What are some good books/references on
the web, to look at?  What areas of the kernel are in need of help (I
just finished reading this months archives and am starting to go
backwards)?  I have a keen interest in the Java VM as I would like a VM
that actually runs the current version on Mac (call me a hopeless
romantic ;-), so any pointers on the JVM would be very cool.

My java experience is light, my c++ experience is almost nil, but I have
a strong desire to learn and help this project, so let me know.  I have
also downloaded the current dist and will be looking at it tonight.
