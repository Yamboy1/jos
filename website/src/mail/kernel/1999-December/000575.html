<PRE>Hi all,

I have made a set of changes to the consoles such that F1 is now the 'native'
console.  I did this so that you can still view the output of kprintf and
System.out even if you are muddling around with the consoles (which would
clear the screen.)  My next step is to increase the size of the buffer and
somehow figure out a way to be able to page up and down on the native console
so that we can view output that has scrolled out of view.

In doing this I also discovered a bug with the decaf native methods.  I had
made a new class, consoleNative, which implements ConsoleDriver just like
jos.platform.drivers.console does.  In consoleNative, putChar and setChar
became native methods.  Suddenly, all keyboard input was outputted to the
native console instead of the java consoles.  What was happenning is that the
native consoleNative.putChar() was being called where console.putChar() was
supposed to be called.  I changed consoleNative.putChar() to instead call the
native consoleNative.putNativeChar() and suddenly everything worked.  In short,
there is a problem with how decaf resolves if a native method is supposed to be
used.  I haven't tracked down what exactly is happenning yet, but I did leave
the debugging messages I used to track this down in the code but commented out
along with what to do in order to show the bug again so that someone can track
this down later.

- Avery

P.S.  I was going to include a patch file with this, but the cvs server is down
again.  Could someone with access please restart it?  I'll send the patch as
soon as I see that cvs is up again.  - Thanks.
