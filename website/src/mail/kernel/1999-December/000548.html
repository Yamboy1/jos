<PRE>I am very interested in finishing an implementation of a TELNET service.
With the recent addition of a JCurses library (thank you!), it is more
feasible than ever to finish a TELNET service.

What does this mean? It means that I can set up a JOS machine to run a
TELNET service. I can use any TELNET client from across the network to log
in to my JOS machine and run all kinds of programs.

I have been working exclusively with a stream-based virtual terminal
service. There is already a open-source, free-license TELNET client
available under GPL. It has been well documented in &quot;Java Annotated
Archives&quot; at your local book store.

Here are the milestones we can accomplish with parallel development:

1. JOS telnetd connects to non-JOS telnet
2. JOS telnet connects to non-JOS telnetd
3. JOS telnet connects to JOS telnetd

The &quot;commands&quot; for TELNET are well-documented. TELNET is a stream-based
protocol that maps to methods. Through TELNET, a program running in telnetd
renders output a display window like Terminal in JCurses.

Once we have a telnetd service for a JOS machine, operation of a JOS
machine can be performed across the network. When complete, TELNET requires
TCP, the highest level of the TCP/IP stack. This is why I'm continuing to
develop a TELNET service that runs on any Java platform, including Linux,
OS/400 and Win32.

It is critically important to maintain a strong model for object-oriented
batch programs. The telnet daemon (telnetd) is a hostile environment for
*visual* Java beans. The telnet daemon cannot be a bean box. Why? Because
the telnet daemon itself needs no visual presentation in a production
environment. It must be able to run any program written in Java and yet
never display a graphic element.

It has take a while to reduce the TELNET daemon down to a bare-bones
reusable environment for JOS programs. Many components have already been
distributed in the Smart API products. The following components are needed
to finish the project:

A. SocketIOSteam
I'm working on the assumption that a socket is not the only source of input
to a TELNET daemon. The java.net.Socket class is just like all the other
I/O steams. It is wrapped in a SocketIOStream, implementing the
org.jos.program2a.IOStream interface. The IOStream interface is used by all
other components, instead of Socket. In other words, output to other
programs can be keyboard-less and &quot;scripted&quot;. This enables classic piping,
the construction of batch test suites, and calling of sub-programs within
the telnet daemon environment.

B. LoginProgram
Upon connection, the user/password is required. The login program calls a
shell program. Which shell program do you want to use? Any shell can be
associated with user/password. The login program closes the socket after
the shell program has finished running.

For that matter...which login program do you want to use? Any login program
and port can be passed to TELNET daemon. The login program (and all its
parameters) are encoded in a single &quot;login&quot; URI.

C. ShellProgram
The shell program accepts a URI until the URI is equal to &quot;logout&quot;. For
each URI, the shell program loads a digital resource and pipes the result
back through the socket.

D. TelnetDaemonProgram
The telnet daemon is also a program. It might be implemented in a number of
different ways. First, as a background program with no GUI capability. When
invoked a GUI-less program runs silently until kill'd.

Second, as a simple console program, incoming URIs might be printed in a
window or logged in a file. A multiple-connection TELNET daemon might
associate a connection ID with each connection so that a common log can be
used for all connections. I have an example of this around here somewhere...
