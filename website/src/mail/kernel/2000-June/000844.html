<PRE>&gt;<i> 	Could you give me a rough guess on the size of the native code in
</I>&gt;<i> the Kaffe library?  
</I>
You could probably get away with only the native code in
kaffe/libraries/clib/native/, which is about 6,000 lines.  There are
on the order of 140 native methods defined in that code.

For Kore there are on the order of 70 native methods, you'll need to
implement.  Kore's native methods are much cleaner in terms of their
arguments, and are quite focused.

Note: these numbers are for mostly just java.lang (e.g., not java.io)
and are approximations obtained via 'grep' and 'wc'.

&gt;<i> When I do the first library integration with decaf, I want the
</I>&gt;<i> smallest possible amount of native code.  (Partly because it means
</I>&gt;<i> we'll have to rewrite less into BCNI, and partly because if the
</I>&gt;<i> amount is small enough, I'll be able to put off implementing JNI.)
</I>
You'll probably want to go with Kore then.  There's no real reason you 
can't have both Kore and Kaffe library support (eventually).  Just
keep the native library support code separate from the core VM.

     To understand recursion one must first understand recursion.
