Not having much to say about the code itself since I haven't written 
any of it (and so don't know what design decisions went into 
certain choices) I would shy away from templates in native code for 
JOS just for portability sake.  In fact, I wouldn't go much past 
EC++ (embedded C++) standard stuff (which I believe nixes 
templates).  I'd also avoid using C++ exceptions because of its 
mixed implementation platform to platform.

I hold these opinions because of two factors that have been 
gnawing at the back of my mind for a while.  First, we want to 
maximize portability.  The simpler the language you use, the better 
the chance you'll find a compliant compiler on a platform.  Second, 
although its not mentioned much at all, it would be best if at some 
point JOS were self hosting.  I see no reason to port the entire gcc 
to java.  It would seem more logical to use C or even a subset of C 
since the native code should be very limited in scope (at least as 
far as our ideal JOS design is concerned).  That way, we could 
build a small C compiler (probably based on the old classic 
SmallC) and a small assembler.  Not something we'll be doing 
soon, but something I'd like us to keep in the back of our minds...
