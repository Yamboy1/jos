<PRE>Howdy all! 

Sorry if i've been really quiet lately. It's not that i haven't been doing
anything, it's just that i haven't produced any working code yet :)
I have been looking very hard at the TCP finite state machine and i'm
trying to think up ways to fit it in an OO framework.
I'm confident it will work :)

&gt;<i>What are the minimum requirements of Linux in order to install JOS?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	JOS should not be using any libraries from your system except in
</I>&gt;<i>its 'kernel emulation', where it uses bits and pieces of the standard C++
</I>&gt;<i>library and the math library.  Optionally, it uses ncurses and libdl.  In
</I>&gt;<i>general, it depends on how the binary was compiled.
</I>
Well, i'd like to get out of the way that when/if JEPS gets integrated in
the host build version, you are going to need at least kernel 2.2 and glibc
2.0.
The reason for this is that the raw packet kernel interface got majorly
redone during the 2.1 series. Since the 2.0 releases seem to be dying a
pretty swift death now (with alan stepping down as a mantainer and no one
stepping in) i decided not to support them for something that's purely for
ourselves (the host build).

As far as integration into the native port goes, i must admit i have
extremely little experience in coding drivers for pci hardware, but i'm
willing to improve in that respect.
Based on the hardware i have over here it would be a driver for an either
PCI or ISA NE2000 clone though. Would that be an acceptable starting point ?

Keep the code coming! :)

Ranieri.
