A DeviceAllocationException can be thrown, and it can be subclassed like
this:

ParameterIncorrectException extends DeviceAllocationException {

	public String getParameterName();
	public Object getParamterValue();

}

ParameterOutOfRangeException extends ParameterIncorrectException {

	public String getParameterValueRange();

}

etc..


&gt;<i> Also, how would one deallocate the resource?
</I>
How about:

Device.close();

or

Device.deallocate();

?

Or, maybe:

URI uri =
   new URI(&quot;device:modem:<A HREF="port://localhost/ports/serial/1/attached"">port://localhost/ports/serial/1/attached&quot;</A>);

Modem modem = (Modem) DeviceManager.getDevice(uri);


modem.doSomething(parameter...);

DeviceManager.deallocate(modem);

&gt;<i> What if the particular JVM that allocated this resource crashed, would
</I>&gt;<i> the resource then be unavailable to everyone, requiring a reboot?
</I>
Will the hardware crash or the software crash?

&gt;<i> Some other things to consider.  How would a program discover which
</I>&gt;<i> devices are available?
</I>
DeviceManager.listBuses();
DeviceManager.listPorts();
DeviceManager.listPhysicalDevices();
DeviceManager.listVirtualDevices();
DeviceManager.listDevices();

and most important of all:

DeviceManager.listDevices(String type);

&gt;<i>  How would the admin then configure these devices so that they are
</I>&gt;<i> setup correctly?  I.e. how would you tell &quot;device:<A HREF="sound://localhost/1"">sound://localhost/1&quot;</A>
</I>&gt;<i> to use DMA channel 1 instead of channel 3?
</I>
&quot;localhost/1&quot; does not point to a device. Maybe something like this:

URI uri = new URI(&quot;<A HREF="device://localhost/bus/pci/4/attached"">device://localhost/bus/pci/4/attached&quot;</A>);
String type = DeviceManager.resolveDeviceType(uri);

The resolve will be a probe with information regarding known device
types. If the device type is unknown, by definition, we don't have a
driver for it.

After you resolve it, you can use the Bean architecture to call methods
such as:

getDMAChannel();
setDMAChannel(1);

&gt;<i> Then again, how would you know that there aren't more than one sound card
</I>&gt;<i> available on localhost?
</I>
JOS startup is responsible for probing the motherboard for everything
connected to it. If JOS cannot find something, the application simply
cannot use it.
 
&gt;<i> Perhaps I'm looking at the problem in the wrong direction.  The URI
</I>&gt;<i> here would be the way for the programs to allocate a resource.
</I>
No, I think the URI is a way of grabbing an interface to a device. Then,
that interface can be used to allocate whatever can be allocated.
Certain things cannot be allocated, right?

&gt;<i> Here we come down to how much configuration of the device should be
</I>&gt;<i> done by the programmer, as opposed through internal setup.  Does the
</I>&gt;<i> programmer really need to know whether modem A is on a serial port or
</I>&gt;<i> a USB port?
</I>
No, but he should be able to know if he wishes to. The JOS programmer
*must* be able to know that, though ;-)

&gt;<i> Would you want to have to type in
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;in:data:buffer:file:fat16:<A HREF="hdd://1?cylinders=255&tracks=65535&file=external.txt"?">hdd://1?cylinders=255&amp;tracks=65535&amp;file=external.txt&quot;?</A>
</I>
No, this is long to type, but that's why JOS can map certain things
during start up. Of course, I do want to be *able* to type the above
thing. The &quot;file:&quot; protocol will be actually a shortcut to:

in:file:device:hdisk:<A HREF="ide://localhost/bus/ide/1/a/1/filesystem?path=...">ide://localhost/bus/ide/1/a/1/filesystem?path=...</A>


Nor will I have to type anything to allocate memory, I can just do it
this way:

String string = new String(&quot;Hello!&quot;);

just as:

File file = new File(&quot;filname.ext&quot;);

&gt;<i> This may be a good place to add our diagnostic tools and configuration
</I>&gt;<i> tools.  But how do we do this?  Do we add another scheme, such as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;config:device:port:/ports/serial/1&quot;, or do we add it to the path:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;device:port:/ports/serial/1/config&quot;?  I dunno.
</I>
The device finder and manager should return devices. We could do this:

Modem modem = (Modem)DeviceManager.getDevice(...);

DeviceConfiguration config = modem.getConfiguration();

config.setParameter(..., ...);

etc.

What do you think?
