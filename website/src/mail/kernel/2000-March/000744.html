<PRE>Here is what JOS looks like on my machine. The &quot;hardware&quot; cursor always
stays at line 3, column 1. For sake of discussion, the first line at the
top of the screen is line 1.

[1] jJOS/decaf

[2] Processor type: &quot;CyrixInstead&quot;

[3] A20 OK, loading decaf...

[4] process_args(&quot;arch/i386/nativecode/jjos-binary  init arg0 arg1&quot;)

[5] argvlocal[00000000] = arch/i386/nativecode/jjos-binary

[6] argvlocal[00000001] = init

[7] argvlocal[00000002] = arg0

[8] argvlocal[00000003] = arg1

[9] bailing out on #00000004

[10] init for jJOS/decaf, version 0.2

[11] init: generating keyboard driver...

[12] init: initializing keyboard driver...

[13] init: generating console daemon...

[14] init: initializing console daemon...

Wow! This is the first time that the keyboard worked for me. I noticed that
key combinations aren't being interpreted as I expected. For example, A,
Alt+A and Control+A is printed as 'a'. So, we need a terminal application
for JOS.

-----

We must have a mechanism to load classes dynamically. There are lots of
classes that do not and should not go inside classes.zip.

When booting with Etherboot, I would like to use the network. If I have
java.sql in a package file called /jpkg/java.sql.package on my HTTP
service, JOS should be able to download it using the java.net package.

When booting with GRUB, I would like to load additional package files from
the /jpkg directory. It seems that GRUB might be less complex. It might use
a class that reads sectors from a disk. If such a class were added to
classes.zip, a program could use it to read additional packages. If code
for this class were compiled directly into jJOS/decaf, it could load
classes.zip.

-----

For asynchonous I/O, each device has a corresponding listener interface.
The run() method might run a device until it is closed. I think we might
need both a low-level keyboard class and a high-level keyboard class. The
low-level class should be jos.device.keyboard (right?) The high-level class
could be org.jos.device.Keyboard. Here is more about a asynchronous
user-level keyboard driver:

// Shell.java
import org.jos.device.Keyboard;
import org.jos.device.KeyboardEvent;
public class Terminal
    implements KeyboardListener {
  private static final char LF = '\n';
  public Terminal() {
  }
  public void run() {
    String s = &quot;bcni:org.jos.device.Keyboard&quot;;
    keyboard = (Keyboard) Factory.getObject( s );
    if ( keyboard == null ) {
      return;
    }
    keyboard.setListener( this );
    keyboard.run();
  }
  public void onKey( Key v ) {
    if ( v.equals( Key.ctrlC ) ) {
      keyboard.close();
    }

    print( v.toChar() );
  }
  public void print( String v ) {
    int iMax = v.length();
    for ( int i = 0; i &lt; iMax; i++ ) {
      char ch = v.charAt( i );
      if ( ch == BS ) {
        gotoxy( row, column-- );
        continue;
      }
      if ( ch == LF ) {
        gotoxy( row++, (column = 0) );
        continue;
      }
      gotoxy( row, column++ );
      putch( ch );
    }
  }
  public void println( String v ) {
    print( v + LF );
  }
  private Keyboard keyboard;
}
