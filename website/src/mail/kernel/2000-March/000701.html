Our first goal must be to &quot;fix&quot; the CVS we already have. Couldn't someone
monitor the CVS site, making sure CVS is up-and-running every day? Couldn't
we create an automatic restart for CVS, starting it whenever it goes down?
Couldn't we create a HTML link to restart CVS when its down?

CVS doesn't really need to be running for check-out, only check-in. If
someone would volunteer to make a snapshot of CVS as an archive, these
files would be available even when CVS is down.

Isn't it possible for the &quot;old&quot; CVS to be a mirror of SourceForge?

What about the future? I think moving CVS is a pretty big deal. It is a big
step. Who is going to do the migration work? Isn't this issue big enough to
require a vote on the vote mailing list?

If we decide to make the move, we should look forward and set a date.
Before that date, the &quot;old&quot; CVS would be the official site. After that
date, the &quot;new&quot; CVS would be the official site. How much time do we need?
