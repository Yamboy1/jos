<PRE>I applaud your comments. I salute you. An operating system must be as
wide-open and future-oriented as possible. The more generalized it is the
better I like it. I want a new OS.

Everything's a digital resource, right? So far, we have two &quot;central&quot;
engines developed with JOS in mind. These are URI-based object factories.

The BCNI factory is intended for one instance per virtual machine. Each
virtual machine can have a unique configuration of BCNI. It supplies
JVM-specific classes. It is one system-wide digital resource factory shared
by all processes. From this discussion, devices are system-wide digital
resources and might fall into the BCNI engine.

The Smart API factory is intended for one instance per process. Each
process can have a unique configuration of Smart API. Smart API is
connected to BCNI through the bcni: scheme. If your Smart API is configured
with the bcni: scheme, you can get system-wide and process-wide resources
from one central engine.

</I>
This is better than what I had in mind. Although I'd rearrange it slightly,
this is the essence of the uniform device identifier. Just as you said, a
serial device is connected to a modem. Devices can be chained. For a
moment, let's think about what is possible, not what is popular.

A device: scheme should map &quot;modem:&quot; to &quot;bcni:jos.device.Modem&quot;. When you
used the modem: subscheme, you're asking for modem interface, not a serial
port interface.

IF a modem is connected to serial port 1, I could write this:

device:<A HREF="modem://localhost/ports/serial/1?maxspeed=...">modem://localhost/ports/serial/1?maxspeed=...</A>

IF a modem is connected to USB port 1, I could write this:

device:<A HREF="modem://localhost/ports/usb/1?maxspeed=...">modem://localhost/ports/usb/1?maxspeed=...</A>

Have you ever seen a modem connected to a parallel port? It is possible,
but not popular. IF a modem is connected to a parallel port 1, I could
write this:

device:<A HREF="modem://localhost/ports/parallel/1?maxspeed=...">modem://localhost/ports/parallel/1?maxspeed=...</A>

&gt;<i>The device manager returns the raw device, and bnci converts it into the
</I>&gt;<i>specified &quot;jod.device.Modem&quot; class.
</I>
I see it the other way around. BCNI returns a system-wide device and the
modem: sub-scheme converts it into a modem interface.

We have not yet talked about a device manager. We have not yet talked about
how system-wide devices are activated, how the device: scheme is
configured, how the central engine makes certain that only one application
has a port open at a time.

&gt;<i>Since more types of devices than modems can be attached to the serial
</I>&gt;<i>port, the device manager can only return the raw version of the device:
</I>&gt;<i>the port itself.
</I>
Exactly. That is why the serial port you specify by path is different than
the scheme that specifies the interface.

&gt;<i>Maybe, during JOS start-up, a mapping facility can create shortcuts,
</I>&gt;<i>such as:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="device://localhost/mapped/modem0/?maxspeed=...">device://localhost/mapped/modem0/?maxspeed=...</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>is equivalent to:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>bnci:jos.device.<A HREF="Modem://localhost/ports/serial/1/?maxspeed=...">Modem://localhost/ports/serial/1/?maxspeed=...</A>
</I>
During JOS start-up, the modem: sub-scheme must be plugged into the device:
scheme factory. The serial: sub-scheme must be plugged in, too.

To get at the raw serial port, you might use a URI like this:

device:<A HREF="serial://localhost/ports/serial/1/?maxspeed=...">serial://localhost/ports/serial/1/?maxspeed=...</A>

&gt;<i>What do you think?
</I>
I think we're making progress. In fact, we're close enough for the
following sub-projects:

1. Creating device interfaces

Someone needs to populate a package with examples of device-related
interfaces. The most important part of this sub-project is the interface
names, not their methods. Sample methods are thought-provoking. Methods
must be refined over time. Starting with interfaces we have already named:

ParallelPort
SerialPort
Modem

2. Creating the device: scheme and its corresponding factory

We need a smart factory that interprets a URI for the device: scheme. Like
any smart factory, it must use a separate plug-in controller for each
sub-scheme.

3. Creating basic implementations

For each interface, a Java programmer should create a basic implementation
of the interface. The interface and implementation must be kept separate in
order for this to work. The basic implementation could be abstract like we
talked about before.

package org.jos.device;
public interface Modem

package decaf.device;
public abstract class BaseModem
    implements Modem
public class BasicModem
    extends BaseModem

package usrobotics.device;
public class USRoboticsModem
    extends BaseModem

package practicalperipherals.device;
public class PracticalPeripheralsModem
    extends BaseModem

For example, it seems to me that Modem has-a SerialPort. Or rather, a Modem
has-a port. A port might be implemented as a real object.

public interface Modem {
  public Port getPort();
  public void setPort( Port v );
}

Then, all kinds of ports could extends the Port interface:

public interface Port {
  public int getID();
  public void close();
}

And we could easily create a port factory based on your paths:

Port s1 = getPort( &quot;/ports/serial/1&quot; );
Port s2 = getPort( &quot;/ports/serial/2&quot; );
Port usb1 = getPort( &quot;/ports/usb/1&quot; );
Port usb2 = getPort( &quot;/ports/usb/2&quot; );
Port usb3 = getPort( &quot;/ports/usb/3&quot; );
Port usb4 = getPort( &quot;/ports/usb/4&quot; );
Port p1 = getPort( &quot;/ports/parallel/1&quot; );
Port p2 = getPort( &quot;/ports/parallel/2&quot; );

AND the port factory would only provide ports that actually exist in
hardware. The exact kind of port must be determined by instanceof. In other
words, the port factory can be automatically configured upon startup. The
port factory can keep track of which ports are &quot;busy&quot;.

There should be a URI for a port factory itself. When you ask for port
factory status, it shows which ports you have and which ports are busy. The
port factory is an example of a system-wide factory. It should be plugged
into BCNI.

There should be a URI for a device factory itself. If the port factory is
system wide, a device factory does not need to be. A device factory uses a
port factory. If the device factory is process-wide, it can keep track of
ports used by a process. It can close all ports used by a process when a
process is killed by the operating system.
