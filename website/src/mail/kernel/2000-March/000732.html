<PRE>Hi there,

I found a really interesting article discribing the inner workings of
japaleno, a JVM written in JAVA, for JAVA.
The programmers follow an approach that is appealing to me. They have
written the main JVM in JAVA...

<A HREF="http://www-4.ibm.com/software/developer/library/jalapeno/index.html">http://www-4.ibm.com/software/developer/library/jalapeno/index.html</A>

To be short, they are dong the following:
On startup, a classic VM (lets call it VM1) is loaded, which loads the main
VM ( VM2 ). Both VM's are written in JAVA, but VM1 has been compiled to
static machinecode, and is not really optimized.
VM1 doesn't need to be oprimized, cause the only job it must do is to load
and invoke VM2. VM2 has a very optimized JIT: it takes bytecodes and
transformes them into machinecode.
The last thing isn't really surprising, but it is if you consider that VM2
is written in JAVA it is.

IBM claims that the entire source of the VM's contains only 1000 lines of C
code. It's that small because the only thing they need to program in C are
the glue-functions to IO, memory and interrrupts. All the other things
suchs as thread-switching, memory-management and synchronisation are
written in JAVA.

There are also some other interesting issues addressed in this article,
such as how they prevent normal users from executing privileged code,
locking and parallel-garbage-collecting.

I think that this approach should also be interesting to JOS: write the VM
in JAVA insteadof C++...

Just some thoughts.

Fushion.
