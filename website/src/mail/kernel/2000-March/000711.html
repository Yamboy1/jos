<PRE>Generally:

	You keep giving a 4 MB figure for the distribution size -- does
that include the (required) class library (uncompressed zipfile)?

<A HREF="http://www.metamech.com/wiki/view/Main/InstallOptions">http://www.metamech.com/wiki/view/Main/InstallOptions</A>

	Monolithic is spelled with an i.  The 'preferred' boot method is
now GRUB -- I won't be checking to make sure the Etherboot version works
as often because the GRUB booter is more convenient for me, now that
George Marrows has down the grunt work :)  Whether or not the GRUB or
Etherboot installation is preferred 'in the real world' is open to
question...

What are the minimum requirements of Linux in order to install JOS?

	JOS should not be using any libraries from your system except in
its 'kernel emulation', where it uses bits and pieces of the standard C++
library and the math library.  Optionally, it uses ncurses and libdl.  In
general, it depends on how the binary was compiled.

Which Linux distribution(s) should I use?

	I haven't noticed a particular preference on the list for
one; jJOS/decaf isn't terribly demanding.

What Linux packages should I install to run JOS? to build JOS?

	Running jJOS/decaf will only require whatever libraries it was
compiled to link against, hopefully.  To build the host target of
jJOS/decaf will require g++, gmake, javac, zip, optionally libncurses, and
optionally libdl.  Work-alikes might work also, though I have no idea if
they do or not.  (gmake for the makefile, g++ for the nativecode, javac
and zip for creating the jJOS/decaf classfiles and ramdisk image)  The
i386 build also needs the jjos-nbi softs (should be in CVS or somewhere on
the website?), etherboot or grub (GM gave a link to where his build of a
bootdisk is), and NASM. (a build of which should also be lying around on
the website somewhere.  Probably named 'tools.tgz', though I wouldn't
count on it.)

Runtime Edition

How do I install a runtime/binary distribution of JOS on Linux?

	Presumably, you untar it.  The distributor may well include a
tarball-root script file to execute jJOS/decaf from the right place and
with the default options.

	The host build creates a Linux executable. Where should it be
installed?

	In the deepest and darkest dungeon of your filesystem, where
nobody (uid 99) and the grues (in 'thedark' group) gather to celebrate
lossage by the light of a flaming core...

	... jJOS/decaf is so amazingly alpha that it emits bad bits as it
decays; its half-life is inversely proportional to the free time of the
developers.  (Wave, everybody!)

	In other words, anywhere other than where it will feel safe and
happy surrounded by its source is probably A Bad Idea.

How many Linux executables -- including shared libraries -- are created by
the build process? What are their names?

	only 'jjos', AFAIK, for the host build; the i386 build has either
jjos-grub or jjos-nbi depending on which boot process you selected, and a
group of intermediate binaries that are utterly useless.

Is there a runtime edition of the host build? If not, what prevents us
from creating one?

	Laziness?

Is there a runtime edition of the JVM-specific classes? If not, what
prevents us from creating one?

	That they don't actually exist yet?


Technical Edition

How do I download jJOS/decaf from CVS?

	With lead-lined packets; see &quot;alpha (-radiation-leaking&quot;
software)&quot; in manual section 9.  The particular incantation used here at
the top-secret jJOS labs buried somewhere under the appalachians, is, of
course, top secret, but the following approximation will probably work:

cvs -d :pserver:<A HREF="mailto:anonymous@jos.org">anonymous@jos.org</A>:/sites/jos/cvs/cvsroot login
cvs -d :pserver:<A HREF="mailto:anonymous@jos.org">anonymous@jos.org</A>:/sites/jos/cvs/cvsroot co JJOS

How do I make jJOS?, decaf? JVM-specific classes?

	'cd JJOS/arch/*/nativecode; make' usually takes care of
it.  Options for * are currently limited to i386 and host.

Which standard Java class library should I use? How do I obtain it?

	Right now, the Sun libraries from the Blackdown (for me, anyway,
YMMV) JDK 1.1.x series.  Hopefully sooner than later, classpath.


	I'd be more specific in some sections, but my build process is
broken in all sorts of interesting ways right now, so I can't do some of
this stuff and find out...
