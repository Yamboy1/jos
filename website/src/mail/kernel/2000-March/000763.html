<PRE>	As long as we're using URI's to request devices, why not use URI's
to provide them?  There are two ways of doing this: a file read on startup
which would be a list a URI's representing devices-by-classname known to
exist on the machine, which a reader process would parse and post,
line-by-line, to the device factory.  By post, I mean something along the
lines of:

...
while ( enumerationOfDeviceList.hasMoreElements() ) {
	/* need to trap errors */
	String deviceURI = (String)enumerationOfDeviceList.nextElement();
	systemWideSmartFactory.addControllerFor( deviceURI );
	}
...

so that every driver listed in the startup device-list would be created
(initialized) in order and registered with the system-wide SmartFactory.

	Of course, one or more of the devices in the list could be, say,
&quot;probeForSerialPortsByIRQ&quot; and would, in its constructor, either post the
results of its probe (controller subclasses which return themselves on 
getObject()) or itself be a factory which would return those driver
instances which it created while probing.  That way, drivers could be
controlled in a unified way by the admin.  Also, since drivers
constructors can themselves call getObject() and addControllerFor(), if a
device in the list requires some other device which isn't available, it
can ask for it to be created; that is, the tree could be constructed
bottom-up.  (I think.  There may be problems with this that I'm unaware
of.)

	Actually, a third method is necessary -- supplying driver names on
the 'command line' to the kernel, so that you don't have to hard-code the
driver(s) used to access the harddrive to read the file to parse to
generate the device tree.  (You should also be able to replace drivers on
the fly, though this would entail support in the driver being replaced in
most cases -- because many drivers are persistent in the sense that
replacing a driver in the Factory does not replace instances of that
driver that may well be cached by an application or system process.)

	If you've already covered this in a prior email, my apologies for
not reading closely enough.
