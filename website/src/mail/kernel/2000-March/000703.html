This is basically what we're doing now.  The CVS server on jos.org 
has been having semi-regular problems and is being restarted when 
needed.  It's flakey nature is prompting the move to SourceForge's 
CVS.

Well, if you actually want to use _CVS_ check out, you need CVS 
running.  

As far as making snapshots available, that sounds like a good 
idea.  Once we move to SourceForge, this process is automated 
as we can have it automatically make CVS snap shots available on 
a daily basis.

&gt;<i> Isn't it possible for the &quot;old&quot; CVS to be a mirror of SourceForge?
</I>
Yes.  But to what advantage?

&gt;<i> What about the future? I think moving CVS is a pretty big deal. It is a big

</I>&gt;<i> require a vote on the vote mailing list?
</I>
It's not actually hard at all.  If we do a fresh setup (which most of 
the kernel developers favor) someone with commit priviledges in 
sourceforge simple checks in the source to start things off.  If we 
want to save the CVS histories in the jos.org server, we simply tar-
gzip up the CVSROOT and email it to sourceforge.  They will install 
it within 24 hours.

&gt;<i> If we decide to make the move, we should look forward and set a date.
</I>&gt;<i> Before that date, the &quot;old&quot; CVS would be the official site. After that
</I>&gt;<i> date, the &quot;new&quot; CVS would be the official site. How much time do we need?
</I>
Last I heard, we're waiting for the kernel rewrite to get to a stable 
state.  Then, one of the core developers (Jim? Ryan?) will check in 
the sources to get the SourceForge cvs populated.
