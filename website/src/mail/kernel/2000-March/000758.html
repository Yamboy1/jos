People are used to working with books, papers and a small device (pen in
the real world, mouse in the virtual world). Windows (ehm... Frames :) )
help users in the sense that the computer is more approachable. You
can't expect someone to change from swapping papers and books (Frames)
to start telling the machine what to do with a command line.

Naturally, everybody HATES to use a mouse, but there is nothing
realistically better yet other than the mouse. I would prefer if I could
use speech to tell my computer what to do, I would prefer to be able to
merely think of what I want my computer to do, actually, I would prefer
not to have to even think that it is a computer and it has to do
something, I just want that something done, one way or another... But
until such biotechnology is designed and available to the general
public, mouse navigated and operated Frames are the most common and well
known way of communicating with an application.

They are the closest thing to the real world applications can offer in
terms of human computer interaction.
