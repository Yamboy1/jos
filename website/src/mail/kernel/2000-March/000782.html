<PRE>&gt;<i> For BCNI and Smart API, no exception should be thrown by a controller or
</I>&gt;<i> factory. This has been a difficult architectural decision. In a multiple
</I>&gt;<i> stage factory, null can be returned much faster than an exception. Throwing
</I>&gt;<i> an exception complicates every Smart API interface. It complicates
</I>&gt;<i> interprocess communication.
</I>
	It should be possible, on the other hand, to generate an
error: scheme that returns the error/exception/problem associated with a
particular URI; it would be entirely optional for each Controller to
recognize error: requests that correspond to URIs for which it has
responsibility.  The idea is similar to UNIX's errno.  e.g. you start at
the root of the tree with an &quot;error:device:<A HREF="ram://?start=0&end=0x100"">ram://?start=0&amp;end=0x100&quot;</A> and
recursively look for a Controller willing to return an error about
device:ram -- presumably, the one which returns objects about device:ram.

&gt;<i> After a resource has been &quot;opened&quot; by the URI-based subsystem, we need a
</I>&gt;<i> corresponding way to &quot;close&quot; it. I expected that objects would implement a
</I>&gt;<i> close() method. The close() method cannot fail. This would be consistent
</I>&gt;<i> with work that has already been done on asynchronous I/O. (And a finalize()
</I>&gt;<i> method should invoke close().)
</I>
	OTOH, finalize() isn't, AFAIK, gauranteed to be called when an
object is garbage-collected, but the more paranoid factories may well
implement reference-counting in their returned objects.  (Device objects,
AFAIK, will never form cycles, so reference-counting should work
well.  This needs more thought, though.)

&gt;<i> &gt;Don't get me wrong.  This feels to me to be one of the best solutions to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;device allocation I've seen.
</I>
	Right on, and for the reasons GCHII gave.
