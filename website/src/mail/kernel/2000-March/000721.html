We must be brave and think of Kore as a stepping stone. It is most
efficient to support Java 0, and then Java 1, and then Java 2 -- in that
sequence. Think of it as the first step to bootstrap jJOS/decaf into
something you can fit into 8MB, with room left over for applications.

Kore design is similar to the Bytecode Native Interface (BCNI) and alt.*
package proposal. I like Kore and BCNI because they have few native
methods. These native methods are &quot;concentrated&quot; together in NativeLang,
NativeIO, NativeNet, etc. for Kore and LangBridge, IOBridge, NetBridge for
BCNI. Concentrating native methods into single classes is easier on a C/C++
programmer!

Unlike Kore, BCNI gives you the flexibility to create many implementations
of the bridge classes, in whatever package you want. While Kore puts its
Native.. classes in the java.* packages, BCNI lets you put your bridges in
your personal package. For example, a bridge for decaf should be in a decaf
package.

When Kore and BCNI are combined, wonderful things start happening. There
are many positive implications. Suddenly, your JVM-specific classes have
the freedom to be implemented in machine code *or* bytecode. That's the
ticket.

It is overwhelming to demonstrate this with Kaffe (Java 1) or classpath
(Java 2). I want to run JOS. I want to use JOS. I hope you do to.

&gt;<i>The .zip file is 214K uncompressed.  There are about 160 files in
</I>&gt;<i>Kore.  It includes java.lang, java.net, and java.io.  I have a local
</I>&gt;<i>version that has a few fixes w.r.t. v0.0.7 (the last public version).
</I>
I am very pleased to find out that you have fixes to Kore. I have also been
&quot;fixing&quot; Kore. I'm sure many other people have fixed it, too. It is
unfortunate that we can't send fixes to Kore CVS. I have already contacted
one of the contributors to Kore. I asked if the JOS Project could use Kore
as a starting point. He said, &quot;Yes&quot;.

I think we should work toward a distribution of Kore 0.1.0 and make it
available to the public. Why can't we put together a Kore Extension project
on SourceForge? I have code that's ready to upload, don't you?

&gt;<i>The homepage for Kore (embarassingly out of date) is 
</I>&gt;<i>	<A HREF="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/java/kore/index.html">http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/java/kore/index.html</A>
</I>
If we start a Kore Extension project on SourceForge -- for the purpose of
plugging it into decaf as a stepping stone, we should be able to contact
the author of the Kore homepage. That author should add a link to SourceForge.
