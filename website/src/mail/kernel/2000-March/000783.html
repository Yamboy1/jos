The system and the garbage collector will need to have access to it...
And what if a custom garbage collector is implemented? What if a
profiling utility is to be used? What if the user wants to allow
arbitrary memory access? He can do it with native code now, why not be
able to do it on JOS? How will security be implemented there? This is a
VERY important matter, and until the security mechanism of this scheme
is resolved and tested, arbitrary memory access should not be
implemented, not even for trusted code.
