<PRE>&gt;<i> Perhaps this is for a larger scope.  If a system shared object creates
</I>&gt;<i> another object, what memory space is that created object in?  From what
</I>&gt;<i> I've gleaned from learning about JVM GCing, every shared object needs to
</I>&gt;<i> have all its created objects in the same memory space.  But then, if the
</I>&gt;<i> controller creates objects specific for its current JVM process... What
</I>&gt;<i> kind of mess is this?
</I>
	To a GC, memory is a directed graph with (in our case) a single
source node.  There is no reason to distinguish between memory spaces with
addressing changes if the programmer can't arbitrarily access memory --
that is, they can only chase pointers created by the system.  The insight
that Java memory spaces are disjoint unless the parent process
deliberately maintains a pointer into its child is what underlies the
decaf process model.  The question of which memory space an object is in
isn't the question to ask -- it's which subset of the graph that object is
accessible from.  If a JVM crashes (suppose we can tell this), we re-trace
the tree from the root, excluding the pointer to that JVM -- anything that
doesn't match up is garbage, and all references into it (another graph
traversal) are illegal and need to marked/handled as such.  (e.g. IPC
references must be weak, because it's in the spec that they can throw
exceptions on access, whereas strong references can not.  (Actually, we
need a fourth class, IPC pointers, where they're treated in Java as weak
but by the GC as strong, so that we don't accidentally reap things people
are expecting to be persistent.)  I think that this model generates better
error handling in multi-process code.)

	What this means is that a shared object is pointed to from more
than one (potentially disjoing) subgraphs.  'Where' in memory the returned
object it produces is located depends entirely on whether or not the
producer maintains a reference to it; if it does, the return object is
located in the 'higher'/'larger' subgraph of the shared object.  That is,
if the consumer blows up and dies, the produced object is still 'live;' if
the producer doesn't maintain a reference, the object dies.  For the
former, the object or the parent ought to get an exception (on the next
access) noting that one of its parents has died; for the latter, the
produced object really needs to be finalize()d...  jJOS/decaf, can if,
necessary, (I think!) make /stronger/ conditions on finalize() than the
spec w/o contradicting it.
