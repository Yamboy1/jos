<PRE>&gt;<i> Wow! This is the first time that the keyboard worked for me. I noticed that
</I>&gt;<i> key combinations aren't being interpreted as I expected. For example, A,
</I>&gt;<i> Alt+A and Control+A is printed as 'a'. So, we need a terminal application
</I>&gt;<i> for JOS.
</I>
	*shrug* The console driver(s) are still about as basic as they
get, that is, they ignore the (available) ALT/CTRL information.  On the
other hand, your build may not to be up-to-date; v1.3 of the i386 build's
platform/driver/console.java has support for moving the hardware cursor.

	For I/O we currently have a two-teir system: jos.platform.iodevice
and jos.platform.driver.iodevice, where platform.iodevice is the
abstraction of the device we wish to present considering it as part of the
JOS platform.  Non-platform devices could very well be accessed as you've
suggested previously (URIs).  driver.iodevice implements the platform
interface (superclass) and either runs or makes calls to run the
device.  It is set up as an event-based system, with the exception of
interrupts, whose handlers are run in their own un-interruptable threads
-- where it's strongly recommended that the handleInterrupt() code do the
bare minimum necessary to take h/w timeouts into account and let the rest
of the processing and event generation be handled by some other thread
which it wakes up after handling the interrupt.
