<PRE>&gt;<i> I personally prefer the JavaOS for Business solution to this: instead of
</I>&gt;<i> giving an exact reference to the device when asked for, the device factory
</I>&gt;<i> instead returns a handler.  When the device itself is removed, it sends a
</I>&gt;<i> signal to all registered handlers telling them that the device is being
</I>&gt;<i> removed.  We could have a similar option for swapping devices.
</I>
	A Controller which has the only reference to a device driver would
be one of these handlers, no?  In general, to respond to your concern
about complicated URIs, it would the responsibility of a given Controller
to recongnize more abstract forms.  Protocols like file: are higher-level
protocols that shouldn't do any work on their own, but request services
from lower-level protocols like filesystem:, which in turn operates on
device:s like harddrive: or network:.  file: would post requests like
'<A HREF="filesystem:///',">filesystem:///',</A> and then ask filesystem_root for the filesystem object
representing /mnt -- e.g. filesystem_root.getFS( &quot;mnt&quot; ); -- and then
NFSmount, and finally getFile( &quot;myFile&quot; ); -- which the NFS
filesystem: would implement by asking for network: device at some point.
