What about 16MB?

If we had a virtual memory manager and swap file/partition, wouldn't JOS
require less real RAM? We need to get that virtual memory manager working.

&gt;<i>	If someone felt like cutting down Sun's library, it might.  The
</I>&gt;<i>major barrier to an 8 MB machine is that Sun's class library alone weighs

This is one of the very good reasons for pursuing (1) Kore and (2) package
files.

We could use Kore on a machine that has only 8MB. Kore fits in a &quot;tiny&quot; zip
file. While it only implements the Java 0 Platform from JDK 1.02, it has
all of the Java essentials. In fact, I'm using Kore without the AWT. Why
should I carry the AWT along on an embedded machine that doesn't have a
monitor? That is a waste of RAM on a machine that has little RAM to spare.

We could use package files on a machine that has only 8MB. Package files
are a very good replacement for rt.jar or classes.zip. Each java.* package
has its own package file. Package files are implemented in different ways.
They can be implemented as .zip files, too. If put only one package in a
zip file and call it by the name of the package, you have a package file.
Here is my most recent design for bootstrapping JOS without a large
monolythic classes.zip archive:

core.zip:
  java.io
  java.lang
  java.net
  java.util

java.applet.zip:
  java.applet

java.awt.zip:
  java.awt

java.awt.image.zip:
  java.awt.image

java.awt.peer.zip:
  java.awt.peer

java.sql.zip:
  java.sql

javax.servlet.zip:
  javax.servlet

javax.servlet.http.zip:
  javax.servlet.http

javax.comm.zip:
  javax.comm

javax.swing.zip:
  javax.swing

Because java.io is inside core.zip, extra packages can be loaded as needed
from the I/O subsystem. Because java.net is inside core.zip, extra packages
can be downloaded from across the network from a HTTP service.
