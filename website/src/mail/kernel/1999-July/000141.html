<PRE>Hi,

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I think a number of JOS Members wish to have a Java Drivers rather than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Linux Drivers. They wish to have a &quot;completely&quot; Object Oriented System
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>from scratch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That would be nice but it is hardley practical. The operating system would
</I>&gt;<i>end up being as slow as suns javapc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, I donno what the case that u mean &quot;SLOW&quot; ? Most of people said, One
OS is slow that means the Graphic handling is very slow.
For JavaPC, I can say, they havn't utitilize the device that a PC have. They
just
use 386 IO/CPU mode as the basic platform. That will be slow. Also, Sun
Micro
are very good at Packaging , Management, Product Service. But They are not
not so good at making product as fast as they could. As IBM wrote JDK1.1.7,
IBM provide a increditable JVM so that it run Swing as smooth as I use
Native
Win32 Applications.

IMO, I hope JOS can be a truely OO System rather than a another UNIX Clone.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yes it is a short time but still I can build a kernel from scratch in as
</I>&gt;<i>little as a month that can actually do something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I know I have done it. JOS is way behind the ball in development.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's would be GREAT :D.
But, IMO, I think not so much people are active in JOS Development.
It would be better to find more active peoples to paticiple into it.

&gt;<i>      I would like to have native drivers also and a very small kernel but
</I>I
&gt;<i>am not willing to develop it by myself. First of all I hate the
</I>installation
&gt;<i>difficulties of linux and I will not distribute anything to anyone until it
</I>&gt;<i>can be installed by a single command. I also hate the darn linux file
</I>system
&gt;<i>it sucks also.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, In my point of view, Linux can provide MANY DRIVERS to JOS as well.
Both of them are GPL. I think no one will mind us if we using their drivers.

For native drivers, well, If the drivers really Performance critieal, it
would be better
to have a native one. I think no one will like a Slow Drivers. Right ? :p
But if the
case is not too bad. A Java Implementation would be better. Since this OS is
a OS of Java. :ppp

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Its a RAD IDE pascal project called Lazarus
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>www.pcpros.net/~vbman
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
thanks for ur links. :D

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>JOS is also based on a single instance JVM design. This is a very poor
</I>&gt;<i>design in my opinion. One exception and the whole os is going to go down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
hm, yes, single instance can't archieve a higher performance/fiexible
machine.
Let says, I prefer to wait for a &quot;Complete&quot; JVM out from JOS. and then
discuss
how to implements mulitple one. That's would be better approach.

&gt;<i>In order to be excepted its got to be as fast as any other os and as robust
</I>&gt;<i>as linux we sure do not want another winblows...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
haaaaa........:D, a OS is not only fast that would be ok. I prefer a STABLE,
User Friendly, Fully Customization and Acceptable Performance are enough to
me.
I am sure that no one want another FAST and Unstable Winblows appears again.
:<i>p
</I>
I hate lots of crashing of my PC.........................-_-!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Regards,

Hilary
