Are you running a native or Java window manager?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;them.

Although I would prefer Java drivers, it matters little. An operating
system consists of much more than the kernel and its drivers. You need
to provide libraries for multi-user support, system security, processes,
windowing environment, control panels, etc. Since all of this code will
be used extensively in Java applications, it makes sense for them to be
written in Java. Besides Java is a better language than C. Libraries
written in Java will be more robust, more flexible (components can be
swapped in/out via class loading), and they will run on top of any
architecture that provides an underlying Java interpreter.

&gt;<i> hmm. It seems most of the JOS project developers are not interested in my
</I>&gt;<i> implementation. The JOS team lacks the one thing it needs to be successful.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Development Velocity!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They have been at it for almost two years and have nothing running, this
</I>&gt;<i> will not attract developers. Open Source developers like progress.
</I>
I think a kernel that works &quot;now&quot; would be a good addition to JOS. It
would be great if we could cooperate rather than exclude eachother.
Also, I think you will need some sort of Java library on top of the
kernel that provides operating system facilities. Rather than duplicate
our efforts, you could more easily help us.

BTW, it is false that we have nothing running. The JJOS team have a
kernel that boots and can execute Java bytecodes.

&gt;<i> Not sure not to many people are interested I guess. I will gear up the
</I>&gt;<i> project in the very near future if
</I>&gt;<i> there is enough interest. Unfortunately I will do it seperate from the JOS
</I>&gt;<i> project. It lacks all of the things necessary for success. &quot;Developers&quot;
</I>
If you attack and exclude JOS, I think you've just blocked out potential
contributors.
