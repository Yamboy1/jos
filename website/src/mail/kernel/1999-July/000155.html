<PRE>Hi.
I don't know how the Kernel group approached this problem (despite having
digged through the Wiki), so I'll just start...

On JOS-Arch Gilbert Carl Herschberger II wrote:

&gt;<i> We can do something about it. We can build a JOS platform that has one JOS
</I>&gt;<i> kernel. The JOS kernel loads and runs one or more JVMs, each in a separate
</I>&gt;<i> process. You can start and stop JVMs. There should be three JVMs to choose
</I>&gt;<i> from. Java 1.0, 1.1 or 2.0 (1.2). And when Java 3.0 is available, there
</I>&gt;<i> will be four. You can run multiple copies of Java 1.0 JVM...but only one
</I>&gt;<i> copy of its bytecode will be loaded. Same with 1.1 and 1.2.
</I>
What do you think about the following concept?

We'll use a standard vm that provides everything jos needs (basically hardware
access), on top of this processes will be executed in a ProcessEnvironment,
that uses jos.vm.&lt;impl&gt; to execute bytecode in a protected environment. jos.vm
provides a generic interface for executing bytecode that is controlled by
ProcessEnvironment (ie. you create a new ProcessEnvironment and then customize
its &quot;transparency&quot; and customize Factorys to create certain objects (nobody in
the ProcessEnvironment will know, what is going on)).

jos.vm will satisfy our needs as a vm with lots of features at a lightening
speed and controlled by ProcessEnvironment we can build customized
(=downgraded to Suns Java) and really safe SubVMs. Imagine: Jos supports J3
before Suns beta test finishes. Additionaly the concept can be extended to
include hardware accelerators and other VMs (ie. Smalltalk ).

Waiting for the enlightenment in the form of your comments, Mark :)
