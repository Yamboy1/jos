It might be possible to cache byte codes, native modules, JIT'd and
HotSpotted code across multiple
JVM instances in shared memory.  This could help with the first issue, 
if there are no technical show stoppers.  

The second isn't an issue if native threads are used, right? 

A monolithic gc may be  simpler, but makes the system somewhat hard to 
enforce policies on resources.  How do you keep a process/application
from hogging 
all of the available memory, for example?  


The linux *kernel* is a nice little beastie, it would make a nice
foundation, 
I think, as long as you avoid most of the linux *OS* stuff - text config
files
(well, might be hard to get rid of them all), X windows, 
termio, installation, etc, and mainly just keep the device drivers and a
few other
oddments.    
 Then it could get fun...
