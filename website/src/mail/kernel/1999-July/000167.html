<PRE>Hi All;

Sorry to take so long to get back to you, but I'm just re-surfacing
after a Day Job crisis period.  (And, your question deserves a long
reply.)

Geez, how much time do you have to read my response?  

*Only* 10 times slower?  Actually, at this point in time, that's
actually pretty good.  We're still at the &quot;let's get the damned thing to
work&quot; stage, and we haven't (hadn't until now?) reached the &quot;we'd better
speed this thing up or nobody'll use it&quot; stage.

Starting from the most straightforward &quot;why it's slow&quot; reason...

(0) We've still got this &quot;if (debug)&quot; stuff bloody *everywhere* (note
it's a runtime check within a compile-time macro).

(2) We're not compiling with C++ compiler optimization on.

(3) We've not inlined any of the obvious member functions (e.g., local
variable set/get, operand stack manipulation).

(4) Every Java invocation runs through an expensive kludge to check for
built-in functionality (e.g., reading/writing memory by address).  (This
one has GOT to hurt.)

(5) (This one I haven't had a lot of time to check, but if I'm right,
it's GOT to hurt.)  I *think* that when we check UTF8 Java-space strings
against ASCII, compiled-in strings, we actually allocate a UTF8 copy of
the ASCII string (which entails memory allocation and constructor calls)
to compare the strings.  We'd probably be better off with a special test
which walks byte-at-a-time through the ASCII string and compares it to
the word-at-a-time chars of the UTF8, and also checks for zero values in
the high byte(s).

(6) We've not hand-optimized *anything*.

(7) We've not implemented either JIT or &quot;Hot Spot&quot; type algorithms.

That's all I can think of right now, although I'm sure it's far from an
exhaustive list.

On a more positive note, I have some suggestions for how I would try to
speed things up if I had any time to devote to optimization (it's all I
can do right now to create functionality).  Any volunteers to do the
following?  Thomas?

(1) First, I'd rebuild the host target, enabling profiling (-p switches
to both compiler and linker for the &quot;prof&quot; profiler -- hmm.. can we use
&quot;-gp&quot; for the more-capable &quot;gprof&quot;?).  

(2) Then, I'd add an &quot;on_exit&quot; handler for the host build, which would
do whatever it had to do for the profiler to spit out the &quot;mon.out&quot;
record of execution (this might just be calling the normal exit()
routine).  The goal is that, when the user typed ^C (or whatever), the
&quot;mon.out&quot; file gets written.

(3) I'd try to get some sufficiently &quot;interesting&quot; Java code written, or
find some sufficiently &quot;interesting&quot; benchmark (CaffeineMark -- does it
run under decaf?).

(4) I'd try it under kaffe/whatever and record the execution times.

(5) I'd try it under the host build.

(6) I'd run the profile on the mon.out file, and forward the results to
the list.

Optionally, I'd try this profiling thing again after:

(a) Undefining TRACE and DEBUG macros via the Makefiles.

(b) Turning on the optimizer (I don't know which options to use right
now).

(c) Turning off the &quot;-g&quot; symbolic debugger option (which limits the
optimizations which the compiler can use).

Let me know what you think, and thanks for the attention to the
performance issue!
