Native for now! I plan on changing that...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;JOS consists of a small amount of native code at the core and a large
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;chunk of Java code providing most operating system facilities. These
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;Java libraries could run on top of different kernels, and in fact, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;JOS project has at least two kernels in development. Your kernel is yet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;another kernel that could support the JOS libraries. You are free to use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It would be nice to do this but my kernel is all native linux. I run the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is little benifit to running java drivers it just kills
</I>performance.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Although I would prefer Java drivers, it matters little. An operating
</I>&gt;<i>system consists of much more than the kernel and its drivers. You need
</I>&gt;<i>to provide libraries for multi-user support, system security, processes,
</I>&gt;<i>windowing environment, control panels, etc. Since all of this code will
</I>&gt;<i>be used extensively in Java applications, it makes sense for them to be
</I>&gt;<i>written in Java. Besides Java is a better language than C. Libraries
</I>&gt;<i>written in Java will be more robust, more flexible (components can be
</I>&gt;<i>swapped in/out via class loading), and they will run on top of any
</I>&gt;<i>architecture that provides an underlying Java interpreter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I write code every day in ASM C C++ Pascal Java and VB. I never restrict
myself by excluding a languge that can just plain get the job done.


I agree it would be nice if it where all java but if it takes a couple other
languages to get there and it will than so be it.

&gt;&gt;<i> hmm. It seems most of the JOS project developers are not interested in my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation. The JOS team lacks the one thing it needs to be
</I>successful.
&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Development Velocity!&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They have been at it for almost two years and have nothing running, this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will not attract developers. Open Source developers like progress.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think a kernel that works &quot;now&quot; would be a good addition to JOS. It
</I>&gt;<i>would be great if we could cooperate rather than exclude eachother.
</I>&gt;<i>Also, I think you will need some sort of Java library on top of the
</I>&gt;<i>kernel that provides operating system facilities. Rather than duplicate
</I>&gt;<i>our efforts, you could more easily help us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>BTW, it is false that we have nothing running. The JJOS team have a
</I>&gt;<i>kernel that boots and can execute Java bytecodes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I would have to see the code! I have not been able to see anything on the
site yet.

&gt;&gt;<i> Not sure not to many people are interested I guess. I will gear up the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project in the very near future if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is enough interest. Unfortunately I will do it seperate from the
</I>JOS
&gt;&gt;<i> project. It lacks all of the things necessary for success. &quot;Developers&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That could be but maybe not. I just drove another Open Source project into
the ground. All it took was a little development speed and I constantly are
in communications with all the developers.

In order for me to jump onto the JOS project I would have to see one hell of
a lot more interest than I can see in it now.

I havn't gotten any mail on this list for days, my other projects list sees
at least 50 to 60 a day &quot;Now that is communicating&quot;

&gt;<i>If you attack and exclude JOS, I think you've just blocked out potential
