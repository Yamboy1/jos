Nth has been started yet. Since I don't whether JOS Team like it or not.
And I donno is there any project has been started that similiar to this one.
Most important things that I found in JOS. It seems that two group of people.
One is Kernel Developers. Another is UI Developers. Graphics Devices
seems that it is not belongs to both. It may need to find a group that called
&quot;JOS System&quot;.

hm maybe we can discuss here. :p one more things, I have contacted the author
of
Shark. It seems positive. I would like to invite him to join JOS so that we can

have a graphics device for JOS.

Regards,

Hilary
