&gt;<i>Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>JOS consists of a small amount of native code at the core and a large
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>chunk of Java code providing most operating system facilities. These
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Java libraries could run on top of different kernels, and in fact, the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>JOS project has at least two kernels in development. Your kernel is yet
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>another kernel that could support the JOS libraries. You are free to use
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>It would be nice to do this but my kernel is all native linux. I run the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>linux drivers none of my own.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>There is little benifit to running java drivers it just kills performance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think a number of JOS Members wish to have a Java Drivers rather than
</I>&gt;<i>Linux Drivers. They wish to have a &quot;completely&quot; Object Oriented System
</I>&gt;<i>from scratch.
</I>

That would be nice but it is hardley practical. The operating system would
end up being as slow as suns javapc.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>One things, I don't think using Java to write drivers. It would kill
</I>&gt;<i>performance.
</I>&gt;<i>Since most of bottleneck are not CPU-Bound. It is I/O-Bound. Using Java
</I>&gt;<i>would not decrease the performance SO GREAT as u run Java in other
</I>platform.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>What appeals to me about your kernel is that it is licensed under the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>GPL. There are some people lurking around the mailing lists who have not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>contributed yet because they only feel comfortable contributing to free
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>software. If you worked with the JOS project, those people could finally
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>get their hands on something, which is also good for you.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>hmm. It seems most of the JOS project developers are not interested in my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>implementation. The JOS team lacks the one thing it needs to be
</I>successful.
&gt;&gt;<i>&quot;Development Velocity!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>hm, a Java-Type Operating System Solution is not easy to do. If developers
</I>&gt;<i>develope
</I>&gt;<i>JOS based on other OS, it would be much much faster. But they prefer to
</I>&gt;<i>build
</I>&gt;<i>on their own.
</I>&gt;<i>    Two Years is a SHORT Period to a OS. Linux has been spend near/more
</I>&gt;<i>than ten years. I think the status of JOS is fine.
</I>

Yes it is a short time but still I can build a kernel from scratch in as
little as a month that can actually do something.

         I know I have done it. JOS is way behind the ball in development.

      I would like to have native drivers also and a very small kernel but I
am not willing to develop it by myself. First of all I hate the installation
difficulties of linux and I will not distribute anything to anyone until it
can be installed by a single command. I also hate the darn linux file system
it sucks also.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>They have been at it for almost two years and have nothing running, this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>will not attract developers. Open Source developers like progress. I am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>working another project now and we have 80 very active developers. We
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>attracted this mainy due to the speed of our progress and willingness to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>communicate with team members.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Any Web Page Links? I would like to have a look at it. :D
</I>

Its a RAD IDE pascal project called Lazarus

www.pcpros.net/~vbman

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>I am puzzled that nobody has replied to your email yet. Where are all
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>you free software people!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Not sure not to many people are interested I guess. I will gear up the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>project in the very near future if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>there is enough interest. Unfortunately I will do it seperate from the JOS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>project. It lacks all of the things necessary for success. &quot;Developers&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Sorry for my JOS negativity but I cannot see it succeeding. They wish to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>talk more about politics then the code. The first person to implement a
</I>&gt;<i>Java
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>OS will be the one who holds the pie no matter what it's powered by. In my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>application you are never even going to know Linux is running underneath
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>except for the blazing speed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

JOS is also based on a single instance JVM design. This is a very poor
design in my opinion. One exception and the whole os is going to go down.

In order to be excepted its got to be as fast as any other os and as robust
as linux we sure do not want another winblows...


&gt;<i>The main fact is that , JOS hasn't got a fullly implementation JVM. If it
</I>&gt;<i>has been
</I>&gt;<i>done, the progress of JOS is much much faster. As I know, three JVM/Kernel
</I>&gt;<i>of
</I>&gt;<i>JOS, only implement basic instruction. Graphics and Thread hasn't fully
</I>&gt;<i>implementated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
