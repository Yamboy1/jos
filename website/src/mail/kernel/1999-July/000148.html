<PRE>&gt;<i> I may be blind, but where is the JJOS source code? I've retrieved what's
</I>&gt;<i> on the CVS server, but it seems to be missing stuff referred to as being
</I>&gt;<i> in some other package.
</I>
	If it's in the tools directory, then the missing package is
Etherboot (including netboot), and, if you don't have it, NASM, but
neither of them are source packages.  I don't recall if mknbi-jos is still
up in the CVS anywhere; if it isn't, let me know, and I'll put a .tgz
of it up on the jos server.  (mknbi-jos is an adaptation of mknbi-linux,
provided with the netboot package, to MaKe a Net-Bootable Image for JOS.)

	Furthermore, the makefiles included are an odd and uneasy
compromise between what I'm using and what JM's using, so check file
locations in the Makefiles.  If you've got a specific list of what's
missing, send it over and I'll figure it out.

	As you've probably guessed, the CVS tree is a development, and a
not a distribution tool; any suggestions you've got on a way to make the
distribution step easier for new programmers would be greatly appreciated.
