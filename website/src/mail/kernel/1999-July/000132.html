Grapics is implemented by a bare minimum X implementation running all native
code.

</I>

It would be nice to do this but my kernel is all native linux. I run the
linux drivers none of my own.
There is little benifit to running java drivers it just kills performance.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What appeals to me about your kernel is that it is licensed under the
</I>&gt;<i>GPL. There are some people lurking around the mailing lists who have not
</I>&gt;<i>contributed yet because they only feel comfortable contributing to free

</I>

hmm. It seems most of the JOS project developers are not interested in my
implementation. The JOS team lacks the one thing it needs to be successful.
&quot;Development Velocity!&quot;

They have been at it for almost two years and have nothing running, this
will not attract developers. Open Source developers like progress. I am
working another project now and we have 80 very active developers. We
attracted this mainy due to the speed of our progress and willingness to
communicate with team members.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I am puzzled that nobody has replied to your email yet. Where are all
</I>&gt;<i>you free software people!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Not sure not to many people are interested I guess. I will gear up the
project in the very near future if
there is enough interest. Unfortunately I will do it seperate from the JOS
project. It lacks all of the things necessary for success. &quot;Developers&quot;

Sorry for my JOS negativity but I cannot see it succeeding. They wish to
talk more about politics then the code. The first person to implement a Java
OS will be the one who holds the pie no matter what it's powered by. In my
application you are never even going to know Linux is running underneath
except for the blazing speed.
