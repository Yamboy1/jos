<PRE>I know this may seem strange but...
  Beside being into CS I'm in the military becoming a Chinese linguist.  If you
speak any dialect of Chinese I think it would be interesting if we could have
some computer related chats in Chinese.

  I know this may be a long shot, but what the heck?

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;JOS consists of a small amount of native code at the core and a large
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;chunk of Java code providing most operating system facilities. These
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Java libraries could run on top of different kernels, and in fact, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;JOS project has at least two kernels in development. Your kernel is yet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;another kernel that could support the JOS libraries. You are free to use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;It would be nice to do this but my kernel is all native linux. I run the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;linux drivers none of my own.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;There is little benifit to running java drivers it just kills performance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think a number of JOS Members wish to have a Java Drivers rather than
</I>&gt;<i> Linux Drivers. They wish to have a &quot;completely&quot; Object Oriented System
</I>&gt;<i> from scratch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One things, I don't think using Java to write drivers. It would kill
</I>&gt;<i> performance.
</I>&gt;<i> Since most of bottleneck are not CPU-Bound. It is I/O-Bound. Using Java
</I>&gt;<i> would not decrease the performance SO GREAT as u run Java in other platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;What appeals to me about your kernel is that it is licensed under the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;GPL. There are some people lurking around the mailing lists who have not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;contributed yet because they only feel comfortable contributing to free
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;software. If you worked with the JOS project, those people could finally
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;get their hands on something, which is also good for you.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;hmm. It seems most of the JOS project developers are not interested in my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;implementation. The JOS team lacks the one thing it needs to be successful.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&quot;Development Velocity!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> hm, a Java-Type Operating System Solution is not easy to do. If developers
</I>&gt;<i> develope
</I>&gt;<i> JOS based on other OS, it would be much much faster. But they prefer to
</I>&gt;<i> build
</I>&gt;<i> on their own.
</I>&gt;<i>     Two Years is a SHORT Period to a OS. Linux has been spend near/more
</I>&gt;<i> than ten years. I think the status of JOS is fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;They have been at it for almost two years and have nothing running, this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;will not attract developers. Open Source developers like progress. I am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;working another project now and we have 80 very active developers. We
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;attracted this mainy due to the speed of our progress and willingness to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;communicate with team members.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any Web Page Links? I would like to have a look at it. :D
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;I am puzzled that nobody has replied to your email yet. Where are all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;you free software people!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Not sure not to many people are interested I guess. I will gear up the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;project in the very near future if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;there is enough interest. Unfortunately I will do it seperate from the JOS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;project. It lacks all of the things necessary for success. &quot;Developers&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Sorry for my JOS negativity but I cannot see it succeeding. They wish to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;talk more about politics then the code. The first person to implement a
</I>&gt;<i> Java
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;OS will be the one who holds the pie no matter what it's powered by. In my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;application you are never even going to know Linux is running underneath
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;except for the blazing speed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main fact is that , JOS hasn't got a fullly implementation JVM. If it
</I>&gt;<i> has been
</I>&gt;<i> done, the progress of JOS is much much faster. As I know, three JVM/Kernel
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> JOS, only implement basic instruction. Graphics and Thread hasn't fully
</I>&gt;<i> implementated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hilary
