Cool. How are you handling the graphics side? What sort of changes have
you made to the kernel? etc.?

JOS consists of a small amount of native code at the core and a large
chunk of Java code providing most operating system facilities. These
Java libraries could run on top of different kernels, and in fact, the
JOS project has at least two kernels in development. Your kernel is yet
another kernel that could support the JOS libraries. You are free to use
them.

What appeals to me about your kernel is that it is licensed under the
GPL. There are some people lurking around the mailing lists who have not
contributed yet because they only feel comfortable contributing to free
software. If you worked with the JOS project, those people could finally
get their hands on something, which is also good for you.

I am puzzled that nobody has replied to your email yet. Where are all
you free software people!
