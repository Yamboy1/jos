<PRE>Hi,


&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>JOS consists of a small amount of native code at the core and a large
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>chunk of Java code providing most operating system facilities. These
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Java libraries could run on top of different kernels, and in fact, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>JOS project has at least two kernels in development. Your kernel is yet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>another kernel that could support the JOS libraries. You are free to use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It would be nice to do this but my kernel is all native linux. I run the
</I>&gt;<i>linux drivers none of my own.
</I>&gt;<i>There is little benifit to running java drivers it just kills performance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think a number of JOS Members wish to have a Java Drivers rather than
Linux Drivers. They wish to have a &quot;completely&quot; Object Oriented System
from scratch.

One things, I don't think using Java to write drivers. It would kill
performance.
Since most of bottleneck are not CPU-Bound. It is I/O-Bound. Using Java
would not decrease the performance SO GREAT as u run Java in other platform.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>What appeals to me about your kernel is that it is licensed under the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>GPL. There are some people lurking around the mailing lists who have not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>contributed yet because they only feel comfortable contributing to free
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>software. If you worked with the JOS project, those people could finally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>get their hands on something, which is also good for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>hmm. It seems most of the JOS project developers are not interested in my
</I>&gt;<i>implementation. The JOS team lacks the one thing it needs to be successful.
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Development Velocity!&quot;
</I>
hm, a Java-Type Operating System Solution is not easy to do. If developers
develope
JOS based on other OS, it would be much much faster. But they prefer to
build
on their own.
    Two Years is a SHORT Period to a OS. Linux has been spend near/more
than ten years. I think the status of JOS is fine.

&gt;<i>They have been at it for almost two years and have nothing running, this
</I>&gt;<i>will not attract developers. Open Source developers like progress. I am
</I>&gt;<i>working another project now and we have 80 very active developers. We
</I>&gt;<i>attracted this mainy due to the speed of our progress and willingness to
</I>&gt;<i>communicate with team members.
</I>
Any Web Page Links? I would like to have a look at it. :D

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I am puzzled that nobody has replied to your email yet. Where are all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>you free software people!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Not sure not to many people are interested I guess. I will gear up the
</I>&gt;<i>project in the very near future if
</I>&gt;<i>there is enough interest. Unfortunately I will do it seperate from the JOS
</I>&gt;<i>project. It lacks all of the things necessary for success. &quot;Developers&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Sorry for my JOS negativity but I cannot see it succeeding. They wish to
</I>&gt;<i>talk more about politics then the code. The first person to implement a
</I>Java
&gt;<i>OS will be the one who holds the pie no matter what it's powered by. In my
</I>&gt;<i>application you are never even going to know Linux is running underneath
</I>&gt;<i>except for the blazing speed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The main fact is that , JOS hasn't got a fullly implementation JVM. If it
has been
done, the progress of JOS is much much faster. As I know, three JVM/Kernel
of
JOS, only implement basic instruction. Graphics and Thread hasn't fully
implementated.

Regards,

Hilary
