<PRE>For the JOS mailing lists, you must
be a member to be able to post.  This
does a fairly decent job preventing
spam (since spam engines rarely subscribe).

However, some of you make posts to 
lists using an e-mail address that is
not subscribed... as a result, the
posts are put into an holding queue
untill I (or anyone else who wants
to be the &quot;moderator&quot;) gets around to
clicking OK on the ones that are
good, and denying those that are
bad.  Overall it is about 50% spam,
so I think keeping this method is good.

Anyway, if you do want to post from
two different mailinglists, subscribe
twice (once with each list), and then
there is an option to disable mail
being sent to you... in this way
you get one copy but can have 2 or
more valid addresses that can
post to the list.

Sorry for any inconvience, hope this
helps explain why some of your 
posts have been rather consistently
delayed by a day or so...

Best,

Clark

P.S. If anyone else wants to be
the list moderator... they are more
than welcome!  Just contact me
directly and I'll transfer it
over to you!  I only read the
JOS kernel list a few times
a week...
