<PRE>Hi Avery, and all...

I guess you tried this with the i386 build. The host build works fine with
your testVoidReturn class. Since I haven't worked a lot (well...nothing 
at all..) with the i386 build, I can't help very much...


The RessourceManager is still unfinished, but today I added the
DMA/PORT/IRQ reserve method. The RM is hooked into the dma class, so that
the dma-driver works now with the RessourceManager.

As a consequence of the new RM, the drivers need slightly to be updated.
e.g. the fdc driver contains 2 more lines:

RessourceManager rm=new RessourceManager();
boolean reserved=rm.reserveDMA(2,this,false);

//2     -&gt; channel
//this  -&gt; only this class can access dma 2
//false -&gt; shareable -&gt; if 2 or more drivers are allowed to acces the
//         same ressource

//and the line

dma_xfer(2,address,(int)nosectors*512,true,this); 
// has 1 more argument(this)

Now I thought about the speed of the RM: every call (DMA/PORT/IRQ) has to
be verified. The dma method checks every call if the caller is the
right owner. Isn't that slow? How do other OSes handle ressources?
