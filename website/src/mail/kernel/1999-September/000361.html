<PRE>[Warning: super long.  Required for reading: 4 shots espresso = 32 cups of
coffee]

I'm currently unsure about where discussions about JOSSystem are placed, so
I'll post this to both kernel and arch in the hopes that someone knows.

I've recently been rekindling my interest in Jini, and in doing so I've been
rolling around a Jini-based OS in my head.  Don't know if we want to go that
way (full dedication to a single technology), so here it is for your
edification.  At least if I'm going in the wrong direction, someone can stop
me before I go insane.

First off, if we are to implement a multi-process JVM for JOS, there is a
dire need for shared objectspace between processes (there may not be much of
an argument against this, but here it is anyway). This could be as simple as
a single static hashtable which is shared, or all the way up to a
full-featured registry or Jini name server, and possibly into a whole shared
memory API.  But whatever we do, we need to have shared memory between
processes.  Here's why:

If we want to have Java device drivers, we need a way to share access to
them.  If we cannot share access between device drivers, then we have no way
of restricting threads from interfering with driver access.  I don't know
about you, but I wouldn't want two independent file systems trying to write
files to my harddrive at the same time - can you say &quot;reformat your
harddrive&quot;?

An early wiki message suggested that JOS use the TCP/IP protocol stack for
communication to drivers via RMI.  Note: implied in the statement is a
/shared/ protocol stack.

I suggest, at least at first, that we have a single, static, shared object
which every process can see.  Perhaps something like a registry (see below).
Note that any object registered to this shared object should becomes shared
across the processes.

Ok, onto my JOSSystem idea:
=======================

Jini offers Java applications a unified method of discovering all known
devices  (technically, &quot;services&quot;) on a network (or a stand-alone PC).  Not
only that, but it includes a unified method to interact with all discovered
devices.

I say, let's code all our device drivers to that standard.  But wait -
doesn't Jini require a network?  But at boot time, JOS doesn't have a
network yet, Matt!

The current Jini specification talks about a network (and thus RMI) as the
underlying &quot;bare iron&quot; for a djinn (Jini network).  However, if I read the
small print right, using datagram broadcast for discovery, and RMI for
across-the-wire communication, is only the /default/ implementation.  I
believe that we can still be Jini compliant by making a non-network Jini
network (or is that doublethink?).

If we place the localized Jini lookup service in a well-defined location
(say, the base shared object in JOS, or an parameter in the localized
discovery method), then localized discovery is done by calling the local
lookup service directly, without the need for a network.  Likewise for
finding a localized Jini service.  Calling a Jini service would then be a
direct Java call, without the need for RMI.

We could create a specific localized Jini service which connects the local
Jini lookuped devices to a real djinn.

This way, all our PC (non-Jini ready) devices register themselves to the
local Jini lookup service at boot time (really, post boot, pre shell
startup, so we're left with device discovery in the middle, or rather
JOSSystem boot!).  Then any application or service that requires a service,
finds one in the localized djinn.

To help with security, we should create access levels in our local djinn.
Only services that we declaire public can be seen outside the djinn
protection.  After all, we don't want anyone on the internet to have access
to our PC_CLOCK device, and what could be done with a PCI_BRIDGE device?

We can chain local djinns together in the common fashion of a device tree.
This way, we can have specialized local djinns that only detect a certain
type of device.

Yeah, Matt, that all sounds good and hunky-doory.  But how do we load the
definitions for what localized djinns to load?  We want JOS to be
configurable, which implies a configuration file, but at the time JOSSystem
loads, we don't have a storage access driver!  Sounds like the
chicken-and-the-egg problem.  How do you plan to overcome that one, Mr.
Smartypants?

I'm somewhat stumped on that one.  I've been thinking about several ideas.
One is a &quot;basic local djinn&quot; which is passed to JOSSystem from the JOS-box.
This is about what JavaOS for Business did.  That way, though, we might have
to recompile the JOS-box for different configurations, so that the JOSSystem
has the basic I/O capabilities for loading the robust Java services over the
default ones.  This is also good for JOS for Embedded Devices (tm), which
wouldn't need this kind of configuration time, and would just pass up the
djinn from flash memory (or whatever).

Any comments? Flames?  Abuses?  All are welcome!

-Matt
