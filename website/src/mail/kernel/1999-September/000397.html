Just a really minor point.  &quot;RessourceManager&quot; is a type-o. &quot;Resource&quot; is
the correct spelling, unless you're wanting to differentiate it from
something else...  I'm lucky that I know that spelling, kaws eye'm knot two
gud at spelng, meyesalph.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a consequence of the new RM, the drivers need slightly to be updated.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> RessourceManager rm=new RessourceManager();
</I>&gt;<i> boolean reserved=rm.reserveDMA(2,this,false);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="file://2">file://2</A>     -&gt; channel
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="file://this">file://this</A>  -&gt; only this class can access dma 2
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="file://false">file://false</A> -&gt; shareable -&gt; if 2 or more drivers are allowed to acces the
</I>&gt;<i> //         same ressource
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="file://and">file://and</A> the line
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> dma_xfer(2,address,(int)nosectors*512,true,this);
</I>&gt;<i> // has 1 more argument(this)
</I>
Just my 2 cents.  Should DMA for channel be an instance (created by
rm.reserveDMA(...) ), where all DMA requests are filtered, or should it be
accessed directly like you have above?  Since DMA is a highly time-sensitive
hardware piece (well, all direct low-level hardware is timing sensitive), we
need the fastest method to use it.  But, then, having a spiffy
object-oriented interface is handy, too, especially for porting purposes.

On another point, what should we do with Plug-n-prey devices that have the
option of using one of two DMA devices? Should we force the device driver
developer to write out the long-hand of testing each DMA port, and reserving
the most appropriate one (if both are available), or should this be a
built-in function?  This all comes down to the speed and size of the kernel,
of which I can't properly answer.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now I thought about the speed of the RM: every call (DMA/PORT/IRQ) has to
</I>&gt;<i> be verified. The dma method checks every call if the caller is the
</I>&gt;<i> right owner. Isn't that slow? How do other OSes handle ressources?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This check could be eliminated by forcing all dedicated hardware resources
to be passed through specific instances of a class, which can be
constructed/divied up only by a special resource manager factory.
