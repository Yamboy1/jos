<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; But with regards to the OSKit, I have no idea what it's doing before it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; boots the VM, so it could be something there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Oh, I just meant write the native method for your VGA stuff into
</I>&gt;<i> the VM, and run it to make sure that OSKit wasn't doing something odd --
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. make sure that the problem is the VM/Java, not OSKit.
</I>
That's what I was doing already, but in my stupidity I only implemented
the methods from jjmachine.cc and didn't look at jvmbuiltins. I added the
other 6 read8,write8,read16 ... methods and everything worked perfectly.

I timed the VGA test (for comparison, not competition!), it took about 50
seconds from textmode-to-textmode (including the delay). The PC is a
486DX100 with a venerable Tseng ET4000.

As far as I could see there were some red things at the top, with green
vertical lines. This then got cleared followed by a JOS logo.

Very impressive guys, the fact that I only had to cut and paste 12 methods
(less that 50 lines) into my VM code shows how beautiful device drivers in
Java can be!
