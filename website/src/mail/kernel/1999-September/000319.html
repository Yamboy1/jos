<PRE>	I've been playing with classpath for the past few days, so I'd
figure I'd check in with my understanding so far.

(A) We'll need to add JNI if we want to use classpath's native code.
(B) Some amount of that native code will have libc stuff in it.  While
	this shouldn't be a terrible problem for the host build (anyone
	actually /know/?) it's a disaster for the i386 build.  It looks
	like they put all the native code in classpath/native/*, which
	means we should be able to point the Makefiles at something like
	classpath/i386/* and everything will be happy.
(C) It looks all the jvm-specific bits have been localized to
	java classes in classpath/vm/*, which can just implement in
	jjos/common/decaf[/vm].
(D) The anonymous CVS server doesn't seem to have the 'configure' script
	in it, so get the snapshot if you're interested in working on it.
(E) Likewise, the configure script seems to want japhar to be installed
	(looks for 'japhar-config'); someone should find out what the
	configure script needs to know from this.  (Then implement a
	--with-jjos option on the config?)
(F) Because of (E), I haven't been able to build a classes.zip out of 
	classpath, and see how well it works with jjos/decaf.

	JM, you've been in contact with the classpath developers; if you
could run my suspicions and questions by (one of) them, that would be
great.
