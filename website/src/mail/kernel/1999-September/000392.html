No.  Not only that, I spoke too soon.  I actually *did* put the critical
sections in -- only I put them in the accessor/mutator methods.  Whoops.

Having said that, you do bring up another problem.  Sorry, but I have
not been able to devote much time recently, beyond a problem I'm chasing
down.

Please, anybody out there please feel free to let me know if you've seen
this failure mode...  When I run the VGA driver, it hangs after writing
the blue test pixels over about 3/4 of the screen.  After about another
minute of no activity, the box resets itself.  I don't ever see it go
back to the &quot;text mode.&quot;  However, if I change the increment so that it
only draw every other line, then I *do* see this go to text mode.  I
have done the obvious things to figure out why it's hanging, but have
pretty much come up dry.  I've commented out the &quot;out8&quot; calls in the
native code, and replaced them with &quot;kprintf&quot; calls -- when I do this,
it runs all the way to the end, and does a GC successfully.  

Thomas, if I were to want to go back to text mode from native code so
that I could do a sort of &quot;Blue Screen of Death,&quot; what calls must I make
to the VGA hardware to do that?  Do you know off the top of your head? 
I know you have done this in the Java code...

&gt;<i> Part of why I was asking about the JavaOS docs earlier was that I wanted
</I>&gt;<i> to fix this problem (interrupt lossage, among other things) before fixing
</I>&gt;<i> the keyboard driver, and as long as I was mucking about with it, I might
</I>&gt;<i> as well muck about in a fashion at least vaguely resembling what it
</I>&gt;<i> 'should be'.
</I>
Cool.  This is fine with me if you do this.

&gt;<i>         Anyway, I haven't been doing almost nothing recently, but if I get
</I>&gt;<i> any work done this weekend, I'll try to make work on JNI/classpath...
</I>
I'll have to wait on this until this weekend, which will unfortunately
be shortened due to my having to go to recruiting at a local university
on Friday.

&gt;<i>         Oh, BTW, parts of the NATIVE_CLOCK bit had to do with the
</I>&gt;<i> HANDLE_CLOCK bits because Bocek (I believe) requested use of the rtc for
</I>&gt;<i> the floppy driver.
</I>
Hmm... is the &quot;real time clock&quot; the CMOS read-only one, as opposed to
the system interrupt-generating clock (he asked, confusedly, and away
from his PC documents)?
