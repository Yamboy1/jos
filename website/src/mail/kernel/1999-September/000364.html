&gt;<i> &gt;         Thanks for your suggestion about interp.cc.  I've always been

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; impression, however, that you're essentially hardcoding what the compiler

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your last mail to John Morrison, who knows more about this than I do;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we'll see what he says.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You know, it's funny you mention this.  I just ran some profiling on
</I>&gt;<i>both &quot;normal&quot; and optimized code, and noted that frame::runOpcode took
</I>&gt;<i>9% of the time on unoptimized code, and 12% of the time for optimized
</I>&gt;<i>code.
</I>

by unoptimized code, do you mean that you compiled it with
optimization turned of,
or do you mean the code with the switch statement as unoptimized ('normal') 
code, and my ~code as 'optimized' code?


&gt;<i>  I then checked what the compiler was doing for the switch, and
</I>&gt;<i>found it was generating a jump table as you suggested (you can verify
</I>&gt;<i>this by adding a &quot;-S&quot; switch to the compilation switches for interp.cc
</I>&gt;<i>and check out what the compiler spits out -- the array of .L### things
</I>&gt;<i>is the set of goto-labels for the jump-table).  It's possible we might
</I>&gt;<i>be able to do better if we paid attention to some other things like
</I>&gt;<i>cache locality (I think the jump table might be put distantly in the
</I>&gt;<i>.data section), but I'm not sure we could do a helluva lot better than
</I>&gt;<i>the compiler.  However, if we can, we should...  Benchmarking should
</I>&gt;<i>definitely be done to verify and quantify the progress if we undertake
</I>&gt;<i>the task...
</I>


before I sent you my Idea, i also thought that there might be some way for 
the compiler to optimize the switch statement; but I only found a way
for subsequent case options
(dont know if thats the right word; I mean code that looks like this
swich(var) {
case 1: some code for 1
case 2: some code for 2
case 3: some code for 3
default: some default code
}// end of switch  ),

cause for this case, the compiler (I thought) could just make code 
something like this:
the &quot;swich statement&quot; code,
  it takes its own adress and adds the the content of var;
cause then, for var == 1 it would jump to this, it would add
1 to its address; the resulting adress would contain a goto statement
pointing to the code that handles 1;
if var == 2, it would add 2, and the resulting adress would contain
a goto to a handler for this case,...;

this should look like this:
0xbase  address for switch code
0xbase+1        contains goto for case 1
0xbase+2        contains goto for case 2
...

of course, one if is necessary to check if var contains something bigger
than 3 (in this example), and handle that;


as I said, I thought, that the compiler might make an optimization like this,
but this is not possible with:

swich(var) {
case 10: some code for 10
case 29: some code for 29
case 222: some code for 222
default: some default code
}// end of switch
---

I'm not sure if you understand all my babbling above, if you don't forget it
its not important :-)
it only shows that I dont know how the compiler handles switch optimization;
but I kinda feel that my approach gotta be faster than any switch 
optimization that the compiler can do;
cause we need no if or gotos in the code, we only have to get
get the function pointer from the array using the bytecode as parameter;

also, we don't have to do this with an array:
- locate memory (to hold 256 function pointers),
- then fill this with the function pointers

now, in frame:runOpcode, to resolve the function, only do this:

functionPointer = *base + (bytecode * sizeOf(bool) )

et voila;
I mean that gotta be [much?] faster than some switch thing;

---

another advantage of my approach is, that you could easily change the
bytecode handler functions at runtime (although I don't know if that feature
could be used; I mean, could that be used for any optimizations at runtime, 
something hotspot like;
or maybe to change the behaviour of the vm at runtime (are there any
bytecode differences in the different vm versions?));



&gt;<i>Having said that, there is still tons of optimizations that could be
</I>&gt;<i>done.  Todd and I have written an awful lot of small methods (especially
</I>&gt;<i>accessor methods) and oft-used methods (e.g., setting/getting local
</I>&gt;<i>variables in a stack frame) that could stand to be rewritten as
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;inlines.&quot;  There are probably even more algorithmically interesting
</I>&gt;<i>optimizations that could be made -- we currently do no opcode
</I>&gt;<i>rewriting...
</I>well, I gotta ask stupidly:
what's opcode rewriting?
something like hotspot?
