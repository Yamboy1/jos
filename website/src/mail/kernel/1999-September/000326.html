<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't see myself spending too much time on the JOS project due to other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; committments, but I'ld like to see the project progressing on more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'fronts' than it currently is. We really need some kind of running system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to start working on the higher-level OS services. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	I'm biased, for obvious reasons, 
</I>
	Understood.

&gt;<i>  but I think that we'd be better
</I>&gt;<i> served by continuing progress on JJOS/decaf.  The coding effort involved
</I>&gt;<i> in connecting the OSKit native services with Java (especially in a way
</I>&gt;<i> that's portable back to JJOS/decaf), I think, is substantial enough (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> take long enough) that would be more efficient to go ahead and do in java
</I>&gt;<i> on JJOS/decaf.  
</I>
Well I have to disagree here. While I fully believe that as much of
operating services should be written in Java as possible, I do believe
that we can piggyback on existing code until our own is written (and
debugged). For example, the OSKit can provide us with network drivers,
network stacks, ide/scsi drivers AND the code to mount and read/write
filesystems. This is a substantial amount of work to implement.

 &gt; In particular, integration with classpath or the the
&gt;<i> garbage collector are both enourmously important tasks that will make
</I>&gt;<i> JJOS/decaf an order of magnitude more useful.
</I>
Agreed. But since I've been fiddling with this stuff anyway, I hope you
don't mind if play with my OSKit/JavaVM and the JOS stuff. I've already
played around with init(), running it in Linux as a process, and on the
OSKit kernel. 

The VM I'm using seems to work fine (except my floating point stuff is
broken) and I think it could be useful as a comparative testbed to aid
with debugging etc.

With regards to the VGA driver, I managed to get into VGA mode, but at
that point the screen stays blank and it never comes back. I copied the 6
asm methods from jjmachine* (If I remember), in8 in16 in32 out8 etc.

&gt;<i> 	I'll take this opportunity to apologize for not getting any of the
</I>&gt;<i> work I said I'd do done so far.  Various and sundry hardware difficulties
</I>&gt;<i> caused by a set of upgrades have been plaguing me all weekend.
</I>
Isn't it amazing how computer experts waste so much time messing around
with their hardware? I must have spent hundreds of hours taking my various
machines apart and putting them back together for whatever purpose.
Yesterday I spend about 5 hours trying to get a serial connection up to
GDB for debugging (but I failed miserably). Are any of you doing this?
