<PRE>&gt;<i> OK.  Do you think it's better to leave interrupts entirely *disabled* until the
</I>&gt;<i> Java code decides it's the time to enable them?  This is an entirely reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> approach, and (hmm....) I don't think it will break anything at all (hmm...,
</I>&gt;<i> right?).  Actually, I don't understand why I didn't do it that way in the first
</I>&gt;<i> place (maybe I'm forgetting something ... wouldn't be the first time).
</I>
	I thought there was some good reason for it (leaving them enable
but ignoring the clock) also, but I couldn't tell you what it might have
been.

&gt;<i> So, in other words, I would not be breaking an entirely &quot;working&quot; build for
</I>&gt;<i> you...
</I>
	Right.  Hopefully my commit wouldn't be breaking anything for
anyone else...

&gt;<i> OK.  Let me know when you do this ... I won't really be able to do much more
</I>&gt;<i> until Thursday at the earliest.  Do you think you'll be able to commit your
</I>&gt;<i> stuff by then?  I'd REALLY like to commit the changes both because I'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> attack some of the other remaining problems, and because I'd like the sources on
</I>&gt;<i> more than one disk for safety's sake.
</I>
	I'll try to commit my changes sometime today.  A note about the
Makefiles: -DFAST_NATIVE_CODE activates the check-native-before-lookup
code, which breaks things; -DNATIVE_CLOCK activates the code that traps
interrupt eight in the scheduler.  (-DHANDLE_CLOCK still needs to be
defined in the native build if you want the clock interrupt to reach the 
scheduler at all.)

&gt;<i> Isn't there a JVM compatibility/test suite around?  I can't remember the name,
</I>&gt;<i> but I seem to recall reading about it (but I seem also to recall some
</I>&gt;<i> licensing/NDA issues).  Anybody else heard about something like this?
</I>
	I believe you're thinking about /mauve/, which, the last time I
looked at it, was more of a class-library compatibility checker than
anything else.


	Finally, have you been able to find the JavaOS API specs anywhere?
The website the .pdf files point to seems to have vanished, and I can't
find anything on the Sun or IBM websites anymore.
