</I>yo,

well I guess I can't help you much here, cause I think the source code
is very well organized &amp; well commented;
I had no trouble reading the code, (although I didnt understand some
things, done in the code; but thats only due to my little knowledge of JVM 
internals);

the docs are well enough;

one thought though:
you could provide &quot;hooks&quot; for [future] coders; by hooks I mean something
like a little ToDo  inside the code, at the place where it should be done,
this could be something like little job descriptions for people that look
at the code but don't know where to start;
eg: some code (function,...) that could be implemented more better,
(although thats somehow done already, it could be more direct, so
that people like me could start fooling around with the code);

another thing:
is there something like javadoc for C[++]?
this could help up understanding the code, also the purpose of the
code could be added to this doc;
