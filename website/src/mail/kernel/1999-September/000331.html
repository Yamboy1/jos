<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Well I have to disagree here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	I figured you'd disagree; again, I'm biased, so I'll hold it to be
</I>&gt;<i> a waste of both of our times to argue.  If you get something worthwhile
</I>&gt;<i> going, so much the better.  I will be the first to fall down at worship at
</I>&gt;<i> your feet for satiating the device-driver writers :)
</I>
:<i>-). It's just that an OS without drivers (and hence without a disk or a
</I>network connection), is pretty useless.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; With regards to the VGA driver, I managed to get into VGA mode, but at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that point the screen stays blank and it never comes back. I copied the 6
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; asm methods from jjmachine* (If I remember), in8 in16 in32 out8 etc.
</I>
As far as I could tell the native code was only dependent on these 6, but
maybe it only failed to find another native method *after* it switched to
VGA mode (which makes me look stupid).

&gt;<i> 	Should have been more than 6, IIRC, but whatever. Have you tried
</I>&gt;<i> the native-code equivalent program just to make it's not a problem with
</I>&gt;<i> OSKit?
</I>
Urm, I don't quite understand. AFAIK you can't address the video memory
directly in Linux (even as root), am I wrong?

But with regards to the OSKit, I have no idea what it's doing before it
boots the VM, so it could be something there.
