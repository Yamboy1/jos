<PRE>&gt;<i> I don't see myself spending too much time on the JOS project due to other
</I>&gt;<i> committments, but I'ld like to see the project progressing on more
</I>&gt;<i> 'fronts' than it currently is. We really need some kind of running system
</I>&gt;<i> to start working on the higher-level OS services. 
</I>
	I'm biased, for obvious reasons, but I think that we'd be better
served by continuing progress on JJOS/decaf.  The coding effort involved
in connecting the OSKit native services with Java (especially in a way
that's portable back to JJOS/decaf), I think, is substantial enough (i.e.
take long enough) that would be more efficient to go ahead and do in java
on JJOS/decaf.  In particular, integration with classpath or the the
garbage collector are both enourmously important tasks that will make
JJOS/decaf an order of magnitude more useful.

	I'll take this opportunity to apologize for not getting any of the
work I said I'd do done so far.  Various and sundry hardware difficulties
caused by a set of upgrades have been plaguing me all weekend.
