<PRE>Hey all

This weekend (or more precisely today) I spent a while hacking with the
OSKit, which is developed at the University of Utah.
(<A HREF="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/">http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/</A>). I managed to compile a simple JVM
that I have been working with for the last few months and link it with the
OSKit components to produce a bootable JVM.

I boot the virtual machine with netboot and stick a whole lot of class
files in the netboot image, so far I have managed to run a hello world app
and verified that the garabage collection is working. 

I know there has already been a huge amount of development work on JJOS
and decaf by their authors, but I want to suggest that we examine the
possibilities of the OSKit and perhaps parallel development of another
kernel / VM combination.

The OSKit comes with easy-to-use modules for kernels (threading), memory
management, file io (console), filesystems (memory and disk), network code
(and network drivers) and even some graphics libraries (I think SVGAlib
and support for X). To reuse these components is really easy and could
provide us with huge savings in time spent writing these parts.

I know the OS 'model' implied by the OSKit is not what everyone wants (it
is biased towards UNIX), but it really makes sense to me in terms of code
reuse.

Please tell me what you think, read the OSKit docs and see what it's got. 

I don't see myself spending too much time on the JOS project due to other
committments, but I'ld like to see the project progressing on more
'fronts' than it currently is. We really need some kind of running system
to start working on the higher-level OS services.
