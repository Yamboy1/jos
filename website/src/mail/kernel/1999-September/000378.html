<PRE>I know it's bad form to reply to your own message, but I had a chance to
think more about this design, and I feel that I can better describe my
design philosophy now, with respect to JOS-Box, JOSystem, and Applications.
I'm fully aware of how poor my first-cut (and twelfth-cut) explainations can
be, so I'll try again.


I wrote:
&gt;<i> I'm trying to switch this design philosophy.  This design views all

&gt;<i> and devices as remote.  There is a central local service which is used to
</I>&gt;<i> access all other services - whether they are remote or local.
</I>
The JOS-Box layer contains only the bare-bones device drivers to get it
going.  These are generally hard-coded into the kernel (such as simple text
mode for displaying the Red-Screen-Of-Death, and a basic file system
reader).

The JOSystem layer creates the localized Jini lookup service for which
local, non-Jini devices on the PC register themselves.  This should probably
done as so:
   1) A set of localized lookup services are created (in JavaOS for Business
architecture, these would be the &quot;bus&quot; objects).  These would be things like
&quot;ISA Bus&quot;, &quot;SCSI Bus&quot;, &quot;HotWire Bus&quot;, and so on.
   2) Each localized lookup service then goes about detecting all devices
that it has knowledge about.  This can include detecting a single device,
running a set of plug-ins to detect a particular device, or starting up
another localized lookup service.

All of these lookup services are in a hierarchial view, where the top-level
lookup is in charge of publication to the PC of all usable devices.
Optionally, another lookup service can be loaded on top of that one to
broadcast to the network all known devices (the lookup proxy).

The Architecture layer uses the standard Jini mechanisms to discover devices
on the network.  Commonly, the lookup service used is the top-level
localized lookup service.  This top-level service should determine if the
request for a device is from the local host or a remote host.  If from a
local host, then the local Jini proxy (i.e. the actual device driver) is
given to the application to increase the speed of access.

Hopefully, this clears things up a bit about the design in my brain.
Please, ask questions, and punch as many holes in it as you can.  If there's
some critical error or wrong assumption I'm making, then let's iron it out
or throw out the whole Jini idea.

-Matt
