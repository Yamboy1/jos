<PRE>yo group,

I used jcvs (in windows nt 4.0 )to checkout the JJOS project; i looked at 
the code and found it extremely interesting;
so I booted linux (redhat 5.1) to build it;

I went to the directory where jcvs put the files (c:\temp\jjos, in linux
as /dos/temp/jjos);

the dir contains readme &amp; install files, and also the a file called
build ( a shell script that calls the makefiles for making
the nativecode for host &amp; i386);
the build file also has the rights to be executed (ie the file got xrw
rights, it should be executable);
but when I enter build (or ./build) it only tells me that it doesnt find
the file;

I then tried to do manually what the build file would do (go to the
/arch/host/nativecode dir &amp; call make);
but make didn't get far, it immediatly stopped complaining about
missing separators;
I looked at the make files, and found that some lines were lacking
a &quot;\&quot; at the end, so I inserted this in (I think) all makefiles;
after that, make didn't complain about the separators,

but seemed to have troubles with the relative paths:

:<i> No such file or directory../../common/bytecode/Makefile
</I>'.  Stop. No rule to make target `../../common/bytecode/Makefile

when calling make in /jjos/arch/host/nativecode/;
well, thats obvious, cause if after doing &quot;..&quot; twice, you're only in
/jjos/arch/ while the common dir, is in /jjos;

so to solve this problem, I looked at some makefiles for this code and
changed that relative path to an absolute path, but that didnt change
anything;

after all that trouble, I copied the jjos dir to my linux partition,
I thought that my troubles might be caused, because I had the jjos
dir on my fat partition;
but that didnt change anything;

so I kept fooling around, and found some other make output:

[<A HREF="mailto:root@localhost">root@localhost</A> bytecode]# make
:<i> No such file or directoryystem/Makefile:1: 
</I>/jjos/common/bytecode/jos/system/event/Makefile
/jjos/common/bytecode/jos/system/Makefile:4: *** missing separator.  Stop.

the path is valid; it seems that I forgot to add the separator in this file;


so, I think that's all; I hope my description is detailed enough;
maybe my system in short again:
cvs client: jcvs;
linux:  redhat 5.1, german version, I didnt change anything
	in the development tools;
	also installed the nasm &amp; etherboot correctly;
jdk:  blackdown jdk 1.1.7;


hope someone can help me there;
