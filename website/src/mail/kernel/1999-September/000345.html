<PRE>Hi Todd;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OK.  Do you think it's better to leave interrupts entirely *disabled* until the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Java code decides it's the time to enable them?  This is an entirely reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approach, and (hmm....) I don't think it will break anything at all (hmm...,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right?).  Actually, I don't understand why I didn't do it that way in the first
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; place (maybe I'm forgetting something ... wouldn't be the first time).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         I thought there was some good reason for it (leaving them enable
</I>&gt;<i> but ignoring the clock) also, but I couldn't tell you what it might have
</I>&gt;<i> been.
</I>
So, I'll leave them disabled and see what (if anything) breaks.

&gt;<i> &gt; So, in other words, I would not be breaking an entirely &quot;working&quot; build for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         Right.  Hopefully my commit wouldn't be breaking anything for
</I>&gt;<i> anyone else...
</I>
Well, everybody's had a chance to respond, and I haven't heard anything, so I'm
going to do it later (after I &quot;merge&quot; or &quot;update&quot; with your changes).  Probably
not until tomorrow mid-afternoon at the earliest.

&gt;<i>         I'll try to commit my changes sometime today.  A note about the
</I>&gt;<i> Makefiles: -DFAST_NATIVE_CODE activates the check-native-before-lookup
</I>&gt;<i> code, which breaks things; -DNATIVE_CLOCK activates the code that traps
</I>&gt;<i> interrupt eight in the scheduler.  (-DHANDLE_CLOCK still needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> defined in the native build if you want the clock interrupt to reach the
</I>&gt;<i> scheduler at all.)
</I>
Disabling interrupts will probably solve this problem.

&gt;<i> &gt; Isn't there a JVM compatibility/test suite around?  I can't remember the name,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but I seem to recall reading about it (but I seem also to recall some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; licensing/NDA issues).  Anybody else heard about something like this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         I believe you're thinking about /mauve/, which, the last time I
</I>&gt;<i> looked at it, was more of a class-library compatibility checker than
</I>&gt;<i> anything else.
</I>
Yes, I think Patrick also mentioned this, too (thanks!), and was kind enough to
provide a URL.  It would be great if somebody would step up to trying to check
compatibility here (although maybe it's premature given the state of the
integration with classpath).

&gt;<i>         Finally, have you been able to find the JavaOS API specs anywhere?
</I>&gt;<i> The website the .pdf files point to seems to have vanished, and I can't
</I>&gt;<i> find anything on the Sun or IBM websites anymore.
</I>
There's a broken link to the &quot;JavaOS for Business&quot; documents on:
	<A HREF="http://wwwwswest2.sun.com/software/quick_index.html">http://wwwwswest2.sun.com/software/quick_index.html</A>
I sent a &quot;you've got a broken link&quot; message back to them.  I don't expect any
action on this point.  If you need them, I'm sure we can figure out a way to get
them.
