<PRE>I'll try to answer two messages at once.

But before that, I'll try and specify my philosophy behind using Jini as the
device driver setup.

The current implementation with drivers and networks in OSs is that local PC
resources/services are seen as local devices.  Then when remote services are
tried to use, a large API framework is created to try to emulate the
local-ness of the local drivers, so that the remote drivers act like they
are local.  This is because most current OSs were originally for stand alone
computers, with a limited set of remote capabilities.  Once the technologies
such as CORBA, COM, and RMI became available, the OSs were retrofit to make
it all work.

I'm trying to switch this design philosophy.  This design views all services
and devices as remote.  There is a central local service which is used to
access all other services - whether they are remote or local.

First, a response to the sceptic:

</I>
Well, I started looking at the Jini specification again, and I'll re-do my
terminology to make it match the specs.  Maybe this will clear things up.

We're in agreement with the local proxy of the PC hardware to the djinn
(Jini network), so that when the local proxy is registered to the network,
it registers its known services via remote stubs (if the service does not
have a rmi stub, it is not registered).  Also, I believe, we are in
agreement (from below) that a slimmed-down PC setup may not need a local
proxy to the djinn.

Since the PC devices are (obviously) not Jini enabled, the drivers operating
these devices need to pick up the slack and become Jini proxies.  Since they
are known to be on a local system, their discovery/join mechanisms only work
locally.  It would be up to the local proxy to perform the discovery/join
to the network in the proper Jini method.

So if we specify that all drivers need both RMI stubs and a local version
(which isn't a stretch), any device can be placed onto the network djinn for
anyone to use.  Thus, we could possibly emulate a parallel computer without
too much work on the device level (that was based on a whole 2 seconds of
thought).

&gt;<i> This is great but the problem with jini right now it
</I>&gt;<i> that Free Software only has a partial implementation

</I>&gt;<i> api standards.  Next to JOS of course :) (recreating
</I>&gt;<i> JAVA OS API).
</I>
Ok, you got me there.  However, I don't believe there is anything like the
local Jini lookup service I described in my message.  So this would be our
own development, anyway.  Then we would need to develop the local Jini proxy
like I described above so the JOS computer can interact with the djinn.  So
this is all our development anyway, all based on the Jini specs, not the
actual code.

For the actual Jini code, that could be downloaded by the individual user,
but the system-wide Jini implementation we can provide, along with the Jini
device proxies.

For the boot-level questions:

</I>
I don't know.  That's where I'm in a gray area.  For the moment, I'll do the
cop-out and say the JOSBox layer needs their own simple versions of these
drivers.  These would only need to be the bare-minimum drivers to get the
system to a state where the next level can start.

&gt;<i>2. There has to be a standard -&gt; all vga driver must have e.g. the method
</I>&gt;<i>setpixel. I don't know if that is allready handled by JINI.
</I>
I doubt it.  Jini is in the begining stages where most of this hasn't been
specified.  This is where JOS can come in and blaze a trail for the rest of
the world.  Still, for Video I believe that something along the lines of the
java.awt.GraphicsContext and java.awt.GraphicsConfiguration should do the
trick.  That's only for graphics, though.  We'd need to make an extention to
support text mode.

Didn't we already have a discussion about this?  Have I forgotten so
quickly?

-Matt
