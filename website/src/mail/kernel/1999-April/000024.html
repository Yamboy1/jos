<PRE>	I was just thinking about how one might go about distributing
jos.system.event.* to where they might need to go, in the context of
how java.lang.System.* variables will be redirected *by the shell.*  Uh...
why not let the 'shell' handle event dispatching?  The shell pretty
clearly will know which program is 'active' and needs to have keyEvents
distributed to; make the shell both a keyListener and a keySpeaker, in
other words, where it speaks keys to the applications that are running
under it as necessary, as part of its java.lang.System.* redirects,
basically.  If an application from the c/l implements interface
jos.system.event.keyListener (xxxListener, in the general case, for
whatever redirects the shell supports), the events are direct to the
application; otherwise the shell employs whatever its default handling
might be -- which is probably just converting the keyEvents into a
character stream for the 'active' (fg) application's java.lang.System.*
variables.

	Obviously, the console could do some keyEvent filtering and
redirects as well, and then the Virtual Console Manager (or whatever we
call it -- the consoled that should be the sole jos.system.keyboard
listener in text mode (the listener switching to the WM upon invocation),
started by init, would direct keyEvents to the current console.  Likewise,
the WM could handle redirects to the xterm console objects.  Clearly,
consoled would install a keyboard interperter that would handle the
trapping of ALT-F1 (or whatever) that's used to handle console swapping.

viz, with three virtual consoles, one in use: ( -&gt; speaks to )

jos.system.keyboard -&gt; jos.system.consoled -&gt;
	-&gt; jos.core.console -&gt; login 
	-&gt; jos.core.console -&gt; login
	-&gt; jos.core.console -&gt; jsh -&gt;
		-&gt; j_pine
		-&gt; j_ftp

Clearly, then, access to jos.system.keyboard needs to be limited in some
fashion, because it would screw things up royally to have multiple
identical keyEvent sources in the same dispatch tree.

	There are two ways to implement this.  The first is to implement a
'static' variable somewhere that in turns points to the next object up on
the tree; this would Aviery's (?) idea, with the added understanding that
the static variable is used as the instance for an addKeyListener()
method; and have the access methods, etc. to handle those 'redirects.'
The major problem with this is that it voluntarily adds another static
class to keep track of across different processes, which strikes me as
asking for trouble.

	The second way (there might be more -- any ideas?) would be to
provide a method for the parent process to tell the child process to
listen to it, i.e. setKeySpeaker().  ('discovery' methods, i.e.
findKeySpeaker() simply move the static variable setting stuff a level
away.)  The jos.core.application superclass we provide to simplify the
making of jos-aware applications would provide an addKeyListener()
function in much the same way that Component does for the AWT.

	Comments?
