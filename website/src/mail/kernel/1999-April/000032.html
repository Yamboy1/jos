<PRE>Hi to the JOSCommunity :)

my name is Sebastian Hesselbarth and i am very interested in the jos
project.
i was following some discussions for about 3 month and now decided to
introduce
myself...

OK... i am a 19 year old student from germany. i will have my final
exams in may
and then i want to go to university and study electrical enginieering or
computer
science.
i started java about a year ago and i really like it but i do not like
how to code
on a pc. actually i have w9x and linux running and it is annoying coding
on w9x but
blackdown.org did not finished the port yet :(((
ok so far , sorry if i annoyed you ;)

i just read the &quot;Joe Shmoe&quot;-architecture and i don't know if i quite
understood it
but i want to present my &quot;dreams&quot; of a good os ... (if you aggree or
disaggree please
let me know and please tell me if it is even possible to code ...
because i do not know
so much about lowlevel coding...)

- device drivers should easyly be plugged into the system and a kind of
supervisor class
  should give away needed resources (i think MattAlbrecht mentioned
this!!)
- i think nearly the whole system should be extendible by plugins. i
came to i386 from
  the amiga (which is still alive :)) and i liked the way of pluging
datatypes into the
  system : you want to view &quot;jpg&quot; pics so you just need a app that used
datatypes and
  the jpg-datatype and you were able to watch the pic ... the same thing
could be done
  with jos (i hope) ... you want to have vfat devices or affs disks so
you just plug
  the right modules into a kind of FileSystemPluginHolder class or so
...
- easy gui based handling of the devices (like in w9x but more stable)
and lowlevel
  configuring like in linux should be possible ...

ok that enough for now ... hope i get request from you ...

i am very interested in coding drivers and that stuff but i dont know
really how yet
it would be nice if you could give me some inet resources to read
through ...

 bye Sebatian

</pre>
