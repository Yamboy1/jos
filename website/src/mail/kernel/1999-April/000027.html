<PRE>	Didn't get much coding done recently, I've been trying to hash
out some necessary aspects of the driver architecture before I start
coding something more complicated (i.e. an echo console w/ scancode
translations).  The rest of my time was spent fiddling with designs for
implementing monitors, which (I think) are the last big part misssing from
the JVM proper for 1.0.2-compliance.  (The native end of the class library
is, of course, missing.)  Nothing definite yet.
	JM has been putting some major effort into JJOS &amp; decaf; I expect
his work to yield substantial fruits shortly, including speed &amp; size
improvements, as well as double/long primitive types support.  Things will
probably slow down over here as I get busier IRL, but you should expect
some major milestones to be reached in decaf/JJOS by month's end.

	BTW: is anyone familiar with the Electrical Fire project?
