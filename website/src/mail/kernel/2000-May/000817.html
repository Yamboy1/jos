<PRE>&gt;<i> What is the kernel supposed to do?
</I>
	That's good question.  Right now, JJOS exists to provide h/w
abstraction services to decaf, and the other two kernels don't seem to be
under active development.  (Well, neither is JJOS right now, because its
author has been too busy, but at least it's in use for something under
active development.)

&gt;<i> Which part do the Process-management?
</I>
	Right now, there is no process management because there are no
processes.  We've been discussing how to handle doing multiple java
process in a single VM process on the mailing list recently, so that the
JVM would manage processes.  When we get native processes, the kernel will
take a hand.

&gt;<i> Which part do the I/O- / Menory- / FS- management/implementation?
</I>
	Memory -- no virtual memory yet; FS -- will be handled by the Java
side of things -- I/O likewise.

&gt;<i> What does decaf? It's just the native methods for the JVM?
</I>
	It /is/ the JVM.  The current version hasn't had the interpreter
ported to it yet (it's ground-up rewrite intended for multiple java
processes and supporting a class library); the old interpreter ought to be
available in interp.cc
