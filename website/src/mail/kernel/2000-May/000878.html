Subject: pls help me.

hi wrapi,
   Sorry interrupting your very much.
   I am a fan about Java and Linux. Recently, I made my
most energy into researching JOS because I feel it is
attractive for me.
   But what's regretting is that I have no email box
of mine. So I can not attend JOS org, maybe this day
will be coming to me because my leader have agreed on
apply an email box for me. Hope this day.
   Now I met a problem when I creat the structure of
JOS. Because JOS, at present, is used on the Diskless
workstation. And I have made a floppy to boot JOS
from my Linux server.
   Because my skill is definative, the next step had to
stopped. I don't know which applications, utilities or
tools will be needed in my directory of &quot;/tftpboot&quot;.
   Now the phenomen is the following:
---------------------------------------------
   jjos/decaf
   kernel: a20 enabled.
-----------------------------------------------
  Then the system will do nothing. I think it may be
the problem of shorting necessary modules.
  Do you think so?
  In fact, this problem is so foolish that I really
say it to you. But I had to ask some help for my
developing JOS with Java. After all, I more like
coding with java.
   Thanks a lot in advance
   Sincerely yours
   Arthur.
