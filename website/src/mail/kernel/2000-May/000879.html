Gilbert, do you think it is fair to make people think I said this? I
left it open to discussion on the <A HREF="mailto:arch@jos.org">arch@jos.org</A> list. It goes against my
principles to force others into doing things, which is why I have never
claimed rheise.os to be the official Java layer for JOS (unlike your
claiming that the Program API is the standard way to write programs in
JOS). In fact you have been claiming a lot of things that are untrue, in
private, and now in public, which offends me deeply.

I never said that I'm choosing jos.* and that's that, so Decaf *must*
change it's package name... What I said to you is this:

:<i> In reality either
</I>:<i> decaf's classes can go in there, or my classes can go in there. The
</I>:<i> productive approach is to work out where the classes should go, and
</I>not
:<i> to claim rheise.os is unusable.
</I>
Please note that Gilbert has not yet responded to this in private. He
chose to write this email directly to the list.

Also note that Gilbert was very upset with me for changing my package
name from rheise.os to anything because he believes package names should
never change, that software should be perfectly backward compatible. He
made clear to me in private that his public statement:

(Reference: <A HREF="http://jos.org/pipermail/arch/2000-May/000530.html">http://jos.org/pipermail/arch/2000-May/000530.html</A>)

&gt;<i> Your personal implementation of the framework/API is rheise.os,
</I>&gt;<i> and should be. There is no good reason to change it, now or ever.
</I>
he really did mean that it is too late for me to change the package name
of rheise.os because I have already published it. While I don't feel at
all bound by Gilbert's insistence on perfect backward compatibility, I
do understand where he is coming from. He has started using rheise.os as
an API for implementing his concept of subprograms in one of his
products. Now that I have changed the my package names, his softare will
not work with newer versions of rheise.os.

I do not think it is appropriate to quote what Gilbert said to me in
private, but in order to defend my reputation, I will quote the parts of
the email which I wrote. If Gilbert wishes to post the entire email, he
may (although I wish he would actually reply to it rather than sending
me one offensive email and then claiming he was unsuccessful in
encouraging me to change my package name back. It is sad that it has
come to this, but I do not appreciate Gilbert spreading false statements
about me in public).

======================
(TO: Gilbert)

Let me start with a general response.

I understand you are quite upset that I have changed the package name on
you after you had already started writing programs against the API. This
comes down to a misunderstanding on two levels:

1. You thought rheise.os was simply an API for executing sub-programs.
2. You thought that what I had released was a stable version.

Unfortunately you were wrong on both accounts, and it is my fault for
not making this clear beforehand. rheise.os is a multiple process Java
execution environment as advertised. It is designed to support the four
ways to run programs, three of which are built in to rheise.os (the
process based ones), and the fourth (sub-program) which is handled
entirely outside of the framework, but nevertheless supported.

The second point of misunderstanding is that you thought that this was a
stable release. The fact that the version number hasn't even reached &quot;1&quot;
should have made it clear that this is not the case, but I see now that
I should make it more clear. I am now writing up a proper document that
explains my version numbering scheme. It is basically the same version
numbering scheme that is used by the Linux kernel:

rheise.os-0.1.4-pre4 can be deconstructed as follows:

The first number is the major version number. It is currently zero
meaning it is a project that is just forming. You may only be used to
people releasing software when it has reached version 1, but I am
following the general open source principle of &quot;Release early, and
release often&quot;. That means, in order to allow other open source
developers to contribute, I need a numbering sheme that allows me to
make releases that aren't intended for the general public. This is what
the next component is for.

The second number is odd if this is a development release, or even if it
is a stable release intended for the general public. Since you have
started to use the development version of rheise.os in your product, you
will have to deal with the fact that it is unstable. In these releases,
I may change package names if I like. However, the stable releases will
be maintained separately and the APIs will not change on you. It is only
when the stable release number is incremented that you might get a new
API, but my aim is to make it stabilise as soon as possible. Even the
Linux kernel API changed a lot when it was a few months old. Yet, Linus
still made releases so that other developers could contribute.

The third number represents minor releases that includes changes
developers contribute as soon as they can be made available. This
doesn't happen exactly after every change, but it is still very finely
grained. Minor updates to development versions may contain API changes,
however minor updates to stable versions must not contain API changes.

The -pre4 suffix means that this is the 4th pre-release of what is to
become rheise.os-0.1.4. I have been making pre-releases available to
other developers who have been working with me on rheise.os.

So, you appear to be more interested in the stable line of releases
which actually doesn't exist yet. The middle number is still odd. Once
the development version starts to stablise, I will roll over into a new
stable release (0.2.0) and simultaneously fire up another development
line (0.3.0).

I expect that version 0.4.0 will have API changes over 0.2.0 which means
you should continue to use 0.2.0 until you are ready to upgrade your
software to 0.4.0. The 0.2.0 version can still be maintained for those
people who are still using it (eg. bug fixes), but they won't be able to
take advantage of the new functionality in 0.4.0 until they upgrade
their program code to use the new version. My goal is to make API
changes minimal, but in the early phases I expect they will change a lot
since in the early stages I am more interested in working on the
interfaces over and over again until I've got them exactly right.

--snip--

Just a minor point. I have not renamed the product yet. I _have_ renamed
the java package names, which is a different issue. The latter affects
backward compatibility, and my believe is that such changes should be
made as early as possible. This is because as more people start writing
OS services on top of rheise.os, it will be more and more work for
everyone to change their code when I rename my packages to jos.*. While
my product is not _the_ java layer for JOS, I still see benefit in
naming my classes jos.*. All I have done here is expressed my believe. I
know you have different opinions on backward compatibility and I do not
wish to argue about them here. Let's just acknowledge for the moment
that we have different opinions and we are entitled to go with what we
think is best. Later we can discuss our differences.

--snip--

You can't claim that it is unusable just because it clashes with another
product. Once you see this, then you can focus your attention on design
issues such as: can we reorganise the package structure so that the
existing decaf classes in jos.system.* can go into another package,
leaving jos.* for public APIs? I see little value on claiming that
rheise.os is unusable if the classes are named jos.*. In reality either
decaf's classes can go in there, or my classes can go in there. The
productive approach is to work out where the classes should go, and not
to claim rheise.os is unusable.

--snip--

As I said, I'm not interested in discussing perfect backward
compatibility here. But I will say that I want to be able to work on a
development version and freely restructure things. In addition, I'd like
to release my development version so that others can help me.

--snip--

It is the product name that makes it unique. My proposal for the JOS
process API is that applications deal with a class called
jos.process.JavaProcess. THAT is my proposal. You can replace my product
with a different product and there will be no name clash. If you someone
else decides not to help me extend rheise.os and wishes to create their
own Java layer, they can name their own version jos.process.JavaProcess
too. Or maybe they'll have a different name for that class. You wouldn't
use both their product and my product at the same time, you would choose
to support one and program against that.

It is similar to how decaf is one possible JVM that can be used in the
JOS project, but it is not *the* JOS JVM. However, his interpreter
allows Java programs to use the exact same bytecodes as any other JVM.
There is no name clash. He needs to use the proper symbolic names before
it can be useful. The same applies to rheise.os.

--snip--

Just as decaf is not rheise.os specific. Yet, it needs to conform to
some standard symbolic names before it can be used across different
environments.

Namespace clashes are only a critical issue if you are using the two
products simultaneously in the same environment. If you want to maintain
separate incompatible package names otherwise, that's up to your own
personal tastes. And I know you have different tastes than me. However,
as I said, I do not wish to argue over which one is better, here.
