<PRE>There was soemthing wrong with my subscriptio, and now the moderator got
his own personal copy! Cheers moderator! :)

&gt;<i>there's a noticeable lag when you have to scroll lines at the bottom of
</I>&gt;<i>the screen.
</I>
If i remember correctly both Linux and it predecessor (minix) use hardware
scrolling.
You might want to add that functionality to either the console or the vga
driver.

&gt;<i>In other news, it looks like some people are trying to
</I>&gt;<i>put together an IP stack, and I might take a small detour and oblige them
</I>&gt;<i>with a serial driver (if I can find docs!) to test against Linux SLIP***.
</I>
I'm sorry to sound so negative, but the stack is going to take a while to
reach useable (tcp) level. Don't expect it to be fast either. Usually this
code uses some tyical C approaches to memory, arrays, structs, unions and
typecasts that force me to do most of my packet parsing with byte to byte
copies.
As a i said on the Arch list, tcp is going to be a major hassle to implement.

On a lighter note, i would like JEPS (as i like to call the stack) to be
more or less compatible with the way jjos handles its classes
(NetworkInterfaceDriver is already a superclass of
jos.platform.driver.Device), do any of you kernel persons have any hints on
that?

One other thing, if i have to handle multiple interfaces, i can't allow a
call to any of them to block. The neat way of handling this would be the
windows WaitForMultipleEvent way ..
Pass it a list of events and wake me when one arrives. Then i can service
it and wait upon that event list again. 
Is an event structure like this going to be implemented?

Ranieri Argentini.
