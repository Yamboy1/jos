<PRE>&gt;<i> 2.  Rework it to be a generational collector. This should decrease the
</I>&gt;<i> average pause time by performing lots of little garbage collects, rather
</I>&gt;<i> than the occasional big one (these would still be needed, but less
</I>&gt;<i> frequently).
</I>
	See below for my idea about 'incremental' garbage collection,
which has the same hope.

&gt;<i> One thing to ponder is whether all the above work is worthwhile - the
</I>&gt;<i> Boehm-Demers garbage collector does all the above and more (eg concurrent gc
</I>&gt;<i> apparently), is freely available and usable, and has been developed and
</I>&gt;<i> widely used for over a decade, so is very stable. Integrating that might be
</I>&gt;<i> a better way to get JOS to progress (though perhaps less fun for me :-).
</I>
	Never heard of it -- any links so I can do my reading?

&gt;<i> · There should be another mail of mine floating around on the arch list
</I>&gt;<i> containing thoughts on how to deal with real-time aspects of device drivers.
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have any idea if what I propose there will be sufficient, or
</I>&gt;<i> does more thought need to be given to it?
</I>
	It should be sufficient, but we can just wait and see it.

&gt;<i> Todd - didn't you let slip in a mail recently that you'd had some thoughts
</I>&gt;<i> about Java v C++ gc? Care to elaborate?
</I>
	Well, first that we should separate the two.  The Java GC we can
make perfect without too much difficulty.  (That is, the roots are well
known, and what is and is not a pointer is also well known.)  The C++ GC
then becomes the hard bit.  This note is note particular to a specific
algorithm.  (Any algorithm that works on 'all memory' can be restricted to
the lower or upper N megabytes by having the c_alloc()/java_alloc()
functions return into the lower or upper N megabytes.)

	(An aside here: does Linux do fully dynamic library loading?  That
is, can I do something like:

LIBR * lib = LoadLibrary( &quot;classpath.so&quot; );
JNI * func = lib-&gt;getFunc( some_string_from_java );
if ( func != NULL ) { 
	(* func)( JNI_ARGS );
	} else { throw_NoSuchNativeMethod_exception(); }

	This would make integrating classpath on the host build very
easy.)

[Fair warning: this gets rather long.]

	Anyway, the idea I was referring to earlier needs to be researched
better, but for now I'm calling it incremental gc.  The idea is similar to
that of generational GC in that it tries to take advantage of the fact
that most garbage is created and thrown away very quickly -- in the same
function.  The basic idea is to reap at every stack push or pop, by having
tracked which pointers exist only in local variables.  On the frame pop,
any local-only pointers obviously become garbage; on the frame push, any
pointer that was only in a local and had been overwritten can be reaped.
(I'm guessing the GC overhead would be preferred in function
calls/returns, not in assignments, though this might have to change if we
encounter alot of tight garbage-spewing loops.  (That is, where it would
be better to reap as soon as we can, rather than filling memory and
inserting an expensive pause.))  I'm working on a specific set of actions
to be taken at specific points in the program (here, I'm targeting the
java memory, where we don't have to fiddle with the compiler to execute
certain code on assignments and the like) that will enable the above
distinctions to be made, and hopefully a few potentially useful other
ones.

	In general, three things happen with a pointer: creation,
assignment, and dereferencing.  Our objective is to provide a minimal set
of pointers that will correctly dereference, and we'll ignore that from
here on out.  Creation, too, is relatively uninteresting, though it will
work for us later on by marking created pointers as initially local.
(Where, exactly, that marking takes place is another matter entirely.)
Assignment is the interesing and difficult part, though a few cases we can
dismiss easily.

Obj o = new Object(); or o = new Object();
creation -&gt; local : The pointer remains local; if the assigned-into local
		was a valid local pointer, mark it garbage.

o = p;
local -&gt; local : The pointer remains local; if the assigned into local
		was a valid local pointer, mark it garbage.

o.o = p;
	If o is local, and p is local, o, p, and o.o remain local.
	Otherwise, o.o (should have already) inherits o's type,
		and so does p.
	If o.o was local, mark it garbage.

o.o = p.p;
	If o.o and p.p are local (which requires that o and p are local),
		then all four remain local.
	Otherwise, p.p gains the type of o.o (which should be the type of
		o), and p retains its current type.
	If o.o was local, mark it garbage.

o = fn();
	o inherits the type of the return of fn(); if it was returning a
		local variable, o becomes local, and so forth.

fn(o, p);
	Similar to o = p, where o is not local (where p inherits the type
		of o).  Function arguments are non-locals that may return
		to being local (I need a name) if their type is unchanged
		during fn() -- that is, when fn() pops its frame, o and p
		return to being local (if they initially were).  If o and
		p were not local, they remain not local.

	When the frame is pushed, free the marked-garbage pointers (and
their subtrees); when it's popped, free those and the marked-local pointer
(and their subtrees).

	I believe, though I haven't proved, that a four-tier scheme like
this will work (though it might need a backup collector for some cases; in
the case where the system runs out of memory before the leaking frame is
popped, I'm hoping to prove that the leaking frame can't be proven to be
leaky until its popped -- that is, it's not incr.gc's problem :)) -- will
work (and efficiently) for cases where no two local variables point into
different positions in a single pointer tree.

	That is, if you're holding the root of a tree and traversing it,
when the traversal pointer is overwritten, the scheme above says to
declare its subtree garbage, which is utterly ridiculous, because it's
still referenced from the root pointer.  Verifying this at each push/pop
means that every local pointer tree needs to be traversed and marked used
before trying to free the marked-garbage trees (where the used mark wins
any conflicts).  This would be horribly inefficient, I'd think (though it
would remove the need for a 'marked garbage' category.)  With the
necessary guarantee that any constructed tree is properly marked, I think
this problem ONLY occurs with entirely local trees (that is, with trees
whose roots are local and whose nodes are also local -- created or
returned), because the proper construction gaurantee insures that the
traversing pointer will be marked as non-local, and immune to being marked
as garbage.  Getting rid of the marked-garbage category I believe solves
the problem, though it will make the gc less efficient because memory can
only be freed on a frame return.

	After the proof of correctness, the next extremely difficult bit
will coming up with a way to mark pointers in an efficient manner.  I'm
thinking only a global atomic table of some variety will serve, but we'll
see.
