Building a prototype in Java code might explain how the IP stack does what
it does. The &quot;source&quot; of the packets can be a OS file. Or, a program can
create packets pseudo-randomly. A TCP/IP stack is a sparsely populated
array of IP packet queues and a kind of IP packet listener.

While it manages 65,536 ports, all of these ports are rarely used at once.
In addition, the low-level network driver is not complex. It is a packet
source; it passes the raw packet from native code to an entry point in
bytecode. The bytecode constructs a incoming packet queue, so that no
packets are lost.

The first class is a model of a network packet.

public interface Packet {
:<i>
</I>  int getSourceHost();
  int getSourcePort();
  int getTargetHost();
  int getTargetPort();
:<i>
</I>  byte[] getData();
}

public class BasicPacket
    implements Packet {
  public BasicPacket( byte[] v ) {
  }
:<i>
</I>  private byte[] raw_data;
}

public interface PacketListener {
  public void onPacket( Packet v );
}

A TCP/IP stack is used by a network card driver. All incoming packets are
stuffed into a Packet object and passed to the TCP/IP stack.

  public void incoming_packet( byte[] v ) {
    listener.onPacket( new Packet( v ) );
  }

From the other perspective of a sparsely populated array of PacketQueues, a
PacketQueue is also a PacketListener. A packet queue is available
(virtually) at every IP port (from 0 to 65,565).

I believe the TCP/IP project is important for the future of the JOS project
because it enables critical inter-process communication (IPC) and
inter-machine communication. With a TCP/IP stack, a single-step mechanism
and non-console trace can be introduced into a JOS JVM for additional
debugging.

While the driver software constantly reads all incoming packets, throws
away packets that are not targeted for this TCP/IP stack, throws away
packets that have no corresponding packet queue associated with a port.
When a ServerSocket &quot;opens&quot; a port, a PacketQueue is opened for that port.
Only that ServerSocket can read the packets in its PacketQueue. Each
connection, of course, creates an incoming packet queue for the
stack-assigned port. Only that Socket can read the packets in its PacketQueue.

Almost all of this OO design can be written and refined in Java. Incoming
packets can be single- or double-queued. Outgoing packets should be
single-queued, one outgoing queue for the stack instead of one outgoing
queue for each port.

The only non-Java part is between the NIC and native code that calls
incoming_packet( byte[] v ).

Interface
  Packet
  Stack
  PacketQueue
  PacketSource
  Socket
  ServerSocket
Class
  BasicPacket
  BasicStack
  BasicPacketQueue
  BasicSocket
  BasicServerSocket
  FilePacketSource
  RandomPacketSource

I look forward to using it.
