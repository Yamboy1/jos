A packet queue is a packet queue. The outgoing packet queue and packet
queue for each port are identical, just wired in different directions. It
does not run in its own thread.

When incoming packets are double-queued, network driver and IP layer are
running in two separate threads. The network driver pushes packets onto the
IP packet queue. The IP layer pushes packets into the UDP or TCP packet
queue, where there is a packet queue for each port used. This allows the
network driver to run ahead of the incoming packet queue without losing
packets. It allows the IP layer to run ahead of applications programs
without losing packets.

TCP usually has duplicate packet elimination. TCP is responsible for
resequencing/eliminating packets so they arrive in a packet queue for a TCP
port in the order they were sent. This doesn't need to run in a separate
thread.

A network driver and IP layer can be integrated in a single thread. When
incoming packets are single-queued, a network driver does both. It recieves
packets and pushes them to the right packet queue for each port.

Outgoing packets are much easier to implement than incoming packets. Any
thread, including high-level application threads, can write a packet into
the outgoing queue. It does not run in a separate thread; it uses the
timeslice of calling threads. While running in its own thread, the network
driver reads from this queue whenever there's an opportunity to send an
outgoing packet.

When an application writes a packet for its own machine, an outgoing packet
is immediately -- without delay -- written into the TCP/IP stack, with its
packet queue for each port. Again, this mechanism uses the timeslice of a
calling thread. The IP layer needs no thread of its own.

&gt;<i>I'm currently toying with the idea of giving every interface it's own
</I>&gt;<i>thread  and it's own objects (that would give me a neat Multiple
</I>&gt;<i>Cache/Local Replacement ARP cache and some other link level enhancements

</I>
Threads should be used when they are required. It might be a clean design
to given each layer of the network model its own thread. Threads are
refined after you build a class library and work with the model. It isn't a
decision you must make on day one.

&gt;<i>The problem is that this model grinds to a halt when it comes to the IP
</I>layer.
&gt;<i>IP is responsible for distributing packets among interfaces, and can
</I>&gt;<i>therefore not be bound to any of them.
</I>
The IP layer can be integrated or separate from a network driver. It is a
question of whether the IP layer has its own thread, or not.

&gt;<i>The only thing that comes to mind is to have a single IP object that queues
</I>&gt;<i>incoming packets for all interfaces. This requires strict serialisation on
</I>&gt;<i>the incoming_packet() functions. A thread that lives in IP could then
</I>&gt;<i>handle the packets (route them through, drop them or reassemble them and
</I>&gt;<i>queue them to TCP/UDP objects that eventually put them into user space
</I>&gt;<i>buffers).
</I>
A single IP object queues incoming packets and recieves outgoing packets.
When the IP object is asked to send an outgoing packet to itself, there is
no delay. Such a packet is *never* sent to hardware.

&gt;<i>Hmm, IP does not have ports. UDP and TCP do. This structure belongs over

</I>
You're right. IP does not have ports. UDP and TCP have ports.

An IP address is four octets. It is generally written in decimal dot
notation, like 4.65.6.119. An IP datagram starts with an IP header. This
header has a source IP address and a target IP address. The UDP and TCP
port is considered raw data to the IP layer.

Personally, I recommend Pete Loshin's simple description of TCP/IP in his
boot &quot;TCP/IP Clearly Explained,&quot; published by Academic Press.
