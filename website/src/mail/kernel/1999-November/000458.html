<PRE>	George, I managed to integrate your changes into the tree, but
didn't finish the 'grub' section of the Makefile because I haven't had
time to test it -- but the etherboot side of things is working fine.

	The rest of the new stuff is -DNEW_INTERRUPT_HANDLING support
code, which I'm still finishing up on the Java side (whose updates were
not included in this, because it's already way too late and they're
incredibly extensive).

	I think that should cover it.  George, if you want to finish the
'grub' section in the new Makefile (and test it!), I'll put it into the
tree.  (Unless you want direct tree access, which can probably be
arranged.  Considering you're doing more coding than I am right now :))

	I should have the new keyboard driver finished 'soon' -- that is,
it shouldn't take much coding time, but I don't when I'll next get it --
at which point I'll move the new Java code over.  (And hopefully fix the
drivers I break doing it...)  I think next on my list after that are
direct-address arrays, unless someone else is cranking on it.  (For the
VGA driver, something along the lines of new AddressArray( 640*480*4,
0xb0000).  BTW -- 0xb0000 worked for me on both my PCI and AGP video
cards.  I have no idea why some people seem to need 0xb8000, unless it's
some random broken BIOS thing...)

	Anyway, happy coding.

-_Quinn
