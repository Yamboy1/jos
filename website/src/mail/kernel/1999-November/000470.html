<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>	I haven't finished the optimizations for speed yet*, but the
-DNEW_INTERRUPT_HANDLING Java code now does java-based virtual consoles
(12 of the them!).  Once I write a correct back-end in (i.e. so that the
VGA code can be rolled in -- which I need to look at for
mode-change/checks), I'll probably go ahead and freeze development on it
until I re-integrate it into the JJOS/common/bytecode tree.  (Currently,
btw, the host and the i386 builds share the same java drivers because I'm
trying to test them on the host.  Technically, the host should be using
whatever drivers are for the architecture it's running on, but that would
be a pain to set up and happens be the case now anyway...)

	Anyway, the back-end should allow the consoled to manage virtual
text and graphics consoles, because of the way things are handled
internally.  (As a matter of fact, I hope that the console will virtualize
to include things like telnet sessions and Xterms, but moving right
along...)  The back-end stuff depends on a new kernel/JVM feature I've
been yammering on about for a while, the mapped byte array, which works as
follows:

byte[] vga_text_ram = jos.system.machine.mapByteArray( 0xB0000, 80 * 24 * 2);
byte[] vga_svga_ram = jos.system.machine.mapByteArray( 0xB0000, 640 * 480 );

and so on.  Because we don't have so much as a security model at this
point, the method is fraught with potential for problems, but at least it
will trap pointer overruns.  At some point I should probably find the
lower end of available physical RAM and limit the pointers to below that,
but that's for a later day.  The code for the text-mode physical console
(driver) then looks absolutely identical to jjconsol.h in i386/nativecode,
so I copied it rather liberally.  (Thanks, JM!)

	If anyone would happen to information on how to set the VGA mode 7
cursor, that would be kind of nice, too.  (It would look more
'professional,' anyway.)

	Anyway, current problems: kprintf-console communication.  Right
now there is none, which means all sorts of extremely funky things happen.
It would be nice to have jos.system.kconsole or something that exposes the
kernel's idea of what should be on the screen so it can be mapped to a
virtual console somewhere and fit into the scheme.  Also, the keyboard
driver, while it's the most correct it's ever been**, still isn't entirely
right, and the consoled doesn't (yet) check for the ALT key in conjuction
with the fn key to do console switching.

	*: It's fast enough that's it's not noticeably slower than a Linux
console while you're typing (at the rate that I type, anyway!), but
there's a noticeable lag when you have to scroll lines at the bottom of
the screen.  However -- while coding it, I didn't remember that I had
implemented arraycopy(), so this problem ought to go away.  (Right now,
I'm in a Java byte-by-byte copy loop, which is possibly the least
efficient way imaginable to do stuff like this.)

	**: That I recall, anyway; right now the keyboard driver picks up
on the *lock keys, though it only executes capslock correctly &amp; doesn't
change the keyboard leds; the FN keys work, the shifting is good (upper &amp;
local case as proper) on all the keys to which that applies.  However, the
numeric keypad and other keys with long escape sequences don't work right,
return doesn't induce a linefeed/carriage-return in the console (though
this is probably more the fault of the console than the keyboard driver
code!); tab doesn't work, backspace/delete, etc.

	It's also very stable, and doesn't seem to miss any keystrokes.
The only problem I've had with the current build was that it nuked itself
with some kind of bad pointer on one console switch about twenty minutes
of testing in.  I've since changed the code; hopefully it won't crop
again, because I've got no idea what happened.

	I haven't tried rewriting the VGA driver to use the
mapByteArray() extension, but it should be pretty easy and make
page-switching much easier.  (That is, you can just arraycopy() from a
normal byte [] of the right size when the time comes.)  It should also
improve performance enourmously.  (Assignment into an array is a one
bytecode op with two words as arguments, translating into the bastore()
call, followed by a call to store(), which will dump the value into the
right place.  The function call machine.write() is a bytecode
(invokevirtual) involving several symbol table lookups, a search through
the builtins native code, and finally an ASM call to put the value into
the right place.)

	One more thing: the consoles decide when and when not to 'draw'
themselves based on FocusEvent messages, so as long as all of our code is
well-behaved w.r.t. to that, the consoled will ensure that no two virtual
consoles are trying to write into the vga memory at the same time --
which means things should be fairly stable even w/o security and/or memory
protection.

	I think that covers the current State of the Code from my end.
This progress on the drivers does mean, however, that I haven't put any
time in on integrating classpath.  (I want to learn CVS's source fork
management before I do, because it's going to be an absolute mess for
quite a while.)  In other news, it looks like some people are trying to
put together an IP stack, and I might take a small detour and oblige them
with a serial driver (if I can find docs!) to test against Linux SLIP***.
George has re-integrated the GRUB stuff, and I'll be checking it against
the etherboot stuff sometime this weekend, hopefully.  Other updates?

*** And with a serial port driver, hacking up a VT100 emulator so your JOS
machine will work as a serial terminal shouldn't be too difficult, either,
right?  (For that matter, aren't there already VT100 terminal emulators
for Java, albeit, ones designed for telnet apps?)
