<PRE>I'm currently doing design work / back-of-envelope-scribbling for what I
hope will be the next version of the garbage collector for jjos / decaf.
Here's what I'm planning,  roughly in the order that I intend to do the
work:

1.  Rewrite in C++. Avoid assumptions about 32-bit pointers to simplify
later ports.
2.  Rework it to be a generational collector. This should decrease the
average pause time by performing lots of little garbage collects, rather
than the occasional big one (these would still be needed, but less
frequently).
3.  Tune and optimise.
4.  Add support for finalisation.
5.  Add support for weak references.

As part of this work, I'll need to put in simple support for virtual memory.
This is so that the generational collector can find dirty pages that might
have had inter-generational pointers stored into them. Also, the extra
breathing space offered by a 4Gb virtual address space might simplify some
aspects of heap layout. I'll put out a brief 'spec' before carrying out this
work so that people can comment. Of course, if someone wanted to beat me to
it...

One thing to ponder is whether all the above work is worthwhile - the
Boehm-Demers garbage collector does all the above and more (eg concurrent gc
apparently), is freely available and usable, and has been developed and
widely used for over a decade, so is very stable. Integrating that might be
a better way to get JOS to progress (though perhaps less fun for me :-).

Some other musings:

· There should be another mail of mine floating around on the arch list
containing thoughts on how to deal with real-time aspects of device drivers.
Does anyone have any idea if what I propose there will be sufficient, or
does more thought need to be given to it?

· The current GC and the one proposed above are conservative (see the FAQ
below for what this means). An upshot of this is that objects can't be moved
once allocated, and this restricts the type of gc algorithms that can be
used. There are a number of possibilities for making the garbage collector
more accurate and thus able to move objects:
1. Separate C++ heap from which objects are explicitly freed.
2. Separate C++ heap which is conservatively gc'd.
3. Get hold of C++ object and stack layout from the compiler. I haven't
fully investigated this, but it would seem that the stabs debug information
produced by g++ should contain all the information needed. Whether this is
true when the optimisation levels are cranked up is not clear.

Todd - didn't you let slip in a mail recently that you'd had some thoughts
about Java v C++ gc? Care to elaborate?

Anything else I should be considering? Any other comments?

And finally, a handy GC FAQ: <A HREF="http://www.iecc.com/gclist/GC-faq.html">http://www.iecc.com/gclist/GC-faq.html</A>
