<PRE>&gt;<i> So you are saying that the grub messages were fine?  I guess this means that
</I>&gt;<i> JJOS didn't start correctly for some reason.  
</I>
	Actually, 'bailing out on #N' comes from the jJOS argument
parsing that goes on right before /decaf/ starts up, so I'm not sure what,
exactly, the problem is.  (Look in entry.cc: the last call before
decaf_main() is process_args, which will print the 'bailing out' bit if
debug is on. (ln 89))

&gt;<i> I did have some trouble with making the jjos-common.zip file. The Makefiles
</I>&gt;<i> seem to be out of whack.  For instance the /JJOS/common/bytecode/Makefile
</I>&gt;<i> has as the Prefix ../../../common/bytecode/ .  That is one ../ too many, and
</I>&gt;<i> doing make in that directory fails.  If I edit out one of the ../ it still
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't create the .zip file.  I probably could have figured it out if I had
</I>&gt;<i> a little more time, but I didn't.  I was able to use a zip file in
</I>&gt;<i> /JJOS/arch/i386/bytecode/jjos.zip.  It seemed to be the same thing.  I
</I>&gt;<i> thought that /common was supposed to be under /JJOS/arch.  Did somehow the
</I>&gt;<i> directory structure get screwed up?
</I>
	JJOS/arch/i386/bytecode/jjos.zip is the right zipfile.  The
Makefile in JJOS/common/bytecode -- any Makefile NOT in arch/*/nativecode
(except possibly the GC) is NOT used directly.  They're included into the
arch/*/nativecode Makefile and built from there.  That is, your build
sequence should look like this:

JJOS/arch/i386/nativecode$ make clean
...[There should be no *.o files, and ../bytecode/jjos.zip, along with all
	the class files in ../../../common/bytecode, should vanish.]
JJOS/arch/i386/nativecode$ make jjos-grub
...[The object files are rebuilt, and javac is called to rebuild the class
	files; find is used to pass arguments in to zip, which will print
	out the name of the classes its including in the zipfile.  This
	zipfile (../../../common/bytecode/jjos-common.zip) is just copied
	into the ../bytecode/jjos.zip location.  This will change.]
JJOS/arch/i386/nativecode$ 

	'make jjos-grub' should rebuild the classfile and copy it into
../bytecode/jjos.zip.  The three '..' in the common/bytecode Makefile
refere to its position relative to arch/*/nativecode.  The whole Java side
of the Makefile system will probably be redone when I commit the new
interrupt handling stuff; it's really quite a hack right now, and probably
won't work too well with architecture-specific bytecode.

	W.r.t. to the directory structure, 'common' and 'arch' are at the
same depth from 'JJOS'.
