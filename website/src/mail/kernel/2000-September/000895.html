This seems pretty standard.  Perhaps we should put this into the wiki as a 
standard naming convention.  I assumed it was understood too but it appears 
that its not tha standard.

This seems to be more a matter of what should go into the jos.* package 
space and what shouldn't.  What I think would be really nice is to leave 
most of the jos.* core system packages as interfaces.  Then let 
implementations exist outside of the jos.* package space and get sucked in 
and instantiated at run-time via property files.  This is similar to the 
CommAPI package.  The base package specifies low level interfaces, but the 
actual functionality is provided by packages outside of the 
space.  Depending on the property file you put into your directory, the 
startup code instantiates the correct serial port driver that implements 
the interfaces that the package functionality is built on.

It is my impression that this is the direction that Ryan is 
taking.  However, at this time, due to the EXTREMELY experimental nature of 
most of the code related to JOS, shortcuts will be made, and package names 
will be very unstable.

Gilbert, I understand your desire to keep backward compatibility but it 
simply does not seem feasible with the current codebase.  It's way too 
mercurial at this point.  We don't know what should be in the common 
interfaces and what should be implemented separately.  So i think for now, 
that we'll all have to just live with the inconsistencies and have file 
search and replace ready when changes do happen... ;)

&gt;<i>It is the product name that makes it unique. My proposal for the JOS
</I>&gt;<i>process API is that applications deal with a class called
</I>&gt;<i>jos.process.JavaProcess.
</I>
And this seems reasonable.  In all reality, we should really only 
standardize on interfaces and leave implementations to anyone.  That will 
make JOS's implementation that ships the reference implementation but allow 
anyone to replace any part with any other implementation.
