The GRUB boot image includes everything.  So you just need to jump start it 
via GRUB and you'll get the whole enchilada.  I'm pretty darn sure the 
entire thing fits on one floppy.  Currently that's a very simple set of 
test runs to prove the kernel is doing what it should be doing (and that it 
doesn't do what it shouldn't).  The class library hasn't been ported to JOS 
yet so the classes are pretty small (just the essential basic stuff to 
support the functionality the kernel has now).  There's a lot more work to 
be done before it's really fully functional.
