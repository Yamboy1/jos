<PRE>Sorry to be negative, but I would say we'd have to pull something pretty
amazing out of the hat, JVM-wise, to be able to beat HotSpot or IBM's JVM on
Linux in any area at all. Personally, I think the only reason to be
interested in writing a new JVM is for personal understanding of how they
work and the intellectual challenge (at least that's why I've been
involved).

This overlaps with what I was going to suggest as follow-up to Robert's 'The
JOS Project?' thread. Perhaps JOS should develop along two lines:

1. JVM / low-level OS development along the current lines. If this ever bore
fruit, then it could replace Linux in the following:

2. A separate project to work on closer integration of existing JVM's into
Linux so that shell, user-interface etc is all written in Java. Kind of a
Java-centric KDE / Gnome initially, but it could then worm it's way further
down to start taking over file system and other duties, if we wanted. This
gives us something of a Java OS but without the overhead of trying to take
on the work of writing both Linux and a JDK from the ground up ... (NB
something like this was suggested over at the JavaLobby .. anyone know what
happened to it?)
