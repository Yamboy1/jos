<PRE>This mailing list was set up as a moderated list. A moderator is
responsible for encouraging postings that &quot;relevant&quot; to the purpose of the
list. Clark Evans has been the moderator of this mailing list for a long
time. Thanks Clark!

As of today, Clark has gladly handed over his role as moderator to me. This
mailing list is what you make of it. It was intended to help members of the
JOS Project define and refine an official JOS kernel.

Look through the archives. This list contains a highly technical discussion
about hands-on C/C++ programming for the JOS Kernel and other components.
The discussion has included bootloaders, such as Etherboot and GRUB.
Messages already posted should set a precedent for the kinds of messages
that will be &quot;relevant&quot; in the future.

Only one requirement is real: you must subscribe to the mailing list in
order to get your message posted automatically. I look forward to more
activity on this list.
