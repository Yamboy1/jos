JOS should not require anything special from its JVM. Any virtual machine,
written in C/C++, should compile and run on a JOS-compatible kernel.

Imagine for a moment that it is possible to build an operating system
without changing one word of the Java Virtual Machine Specification. The
specification provides everything that we need to build a Java-based
operating system. We only need to implement that specification on the JOS
platform.

1. JOS is just another platform. A virtual machine on the JOS platform must
implement the exec() method of java.lang.Runtime in order to run standard
Java applications.

2. The exec() method of java.lang.Runtime is always platform-specific
implementation. The exec() method is a native method. The native method is
called by a virtual machine. Therefore, the platform-specific interface is
inside the implementation of a native method, not inside a virtual machine.

3. In a platform-independent application, multiple processes are always
created through this API. The interface is unchanged regardless of platform.

The distinction is this. The critical part of multiple bytecode processes
is found inside a native method. A virtual machine only needs to bind
itself generically to a native method. It doesn't care what the native
method does.

&gt;<i>If JOS /does/ require something special -- e.g. java
</I>&gt;<i>processes -- from its JVM, than there needs to be a standard interface for
</I>&gt;<i>this.  Since that something special would require VM modifications anyway,
</I>&gt;<i>it makes sense to define those things at the VM level.  (As opposed to at
</I>&gt;<i>a Java wrapper level, where the VM provides its own implementation
</I>&gt;<i>classes.)  If all that JOS requires from its JVM can exposed in this way,
</I>&gt;<i>there's no reason to standardize on anything at a lower level than
</I>&gt;<i>this.
</I>
There is already one well-known interface. A second would be redundent,
non-standard and non-portable. It would be redundent because a virtual
machine on the JOS platform must implement the exec() method, even if there
is a second interface. It would be non-standard because it would require a
change to the Java Virtual Machine Specification. A standard Java
application always uses the exec() method to start another process. It
would be non-portable because a second interface is not likely to work on
other virtual machines and would limit the use of the interface to
JOS-specific applications.

So far, the following two theories have been disproven.

1. Only a JOS-compatible virtual machine can save memory.

Memory can be saved in other ways, including the use of read-only virtual
memory and ROM chips for bytecode. Most of this can be done on JOS as well
as on Linux and Windows.

2. A single virtual machine must implement multiple bytecode processes.

Using multiple instances of a task/virtual machine is a reasonable
assumption of the Java Virtual Machine Specification. Multiple instances of
a task/virtual machine does not imply a waste of memory as some have long
suggested. When a task/virtual machine is destroyed by a kernel, its Java
objects are destroyed immediately, neither finalized nor garbage collected.
All threads are destroyed immediately, without throwing a Java-based
exception. Likewise, handles are critical to the communication between
kernel and multiple processes. Direct object references are not enough.

Only a kernel is required to use boot packages. A process is a task/virtual
machine object. Each process has its own CLASSPATH, not just its own CODEBASE.
