<PRE>	The GRUB boot disk is used to load the kernel; it's certainly
possibly that there's an image floating around there which includes the
kernel and loader on one floppy, though I don't have it.  The class
library, however, has to be loaded as a module, because it's ~8 MB in
size.  (Unless someone's been fiddling with the releases while I haven't
been looking.)  While it's true that the library isn't integrate yet, it's
still necessary to run the jos-specific code included in the build.
