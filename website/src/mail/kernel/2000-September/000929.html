I agree but would highly welcome a replacement for CVS.  I find it such a 
pain to use and I'm sure many others do to.  Anyone looking for a project 
that would earn you much appreciation from fellow developers, make a cvs 
replacement that's easier to use for the person that hates version control 
yet still retains power for those that love it...  :)

&gt;<i>Contributing to the
</I>&gt;<i>code via the patch manager can be done without a SourceForge account (it
</I>&gt;<i>appears), though having one will simplify follow-up emails.  In general,
</I>&gt;<i>direct CVS write access both requires a SourceForge account and will only

</I>
Agreed.  The cvs write group is/should be kept really small. _Really_ 
small.  Most people either need access to the source or just will 
occassionally submit patches which can easily be done via the patch 
manager.  When we re-org the structure of jos, I'm going to suggest we take 
a similar tact to the apache (jakarta) project with a limited &quot;committer&quot; 
group with cvs write access, and a large &quot;developer&quot; group with cvs read 
and patch submission to committer access.
