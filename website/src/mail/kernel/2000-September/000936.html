And yet, you do not understand.

There is plenty of excitement on the JOS Project unrelated to jJOS/decaf.
You don't have a monopoly. There are only a few coders interested in your
virtual machine. How long can you keep turning them away? You have turned
away everyone using Microsoft Windows. You have turned away everyone that
does not use CVS. Instead of turning people away, you should try to
included them.

By definition, an open source project is designed to enable other people to
look at your source code. Distributing the source code is a high priority.

More people read than contribute. That is the nature of open source
projects and publication in general. You should be more concerned about
readers than contributors. Sometimes, a reader becomes a contributor.

If your software isn't ready-to-run, you should not distribute it. At some
point, jJOS/decaf was ready-to-run. The ready-to-run project should not
have been disturbed by a re-write.
