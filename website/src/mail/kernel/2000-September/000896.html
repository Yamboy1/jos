No.  I like the way Tomcat is being handled.  Essentially, there's a main 
cvs tree with the name tomcat associated with a codebase.  When a 
&quot;competing&quot; version was proposed, it went in under a new namespace (as a 
separate cvs module in the same cvs tree).  A vote was taken and the 
competing version was voted as being the successor to the current 
tomcat.  So the old tomcat will remain tomcat3 and the new code will be 
renamed and repackaged as tomcat4 and merged into the tree (the 3x just 
gets branched off).

Now whether the &quot;competing&quot; versions exist on the same cvs tree or in 
separate sourceforge projects should probably be up to the preferences of 
the core developers for that project.  I don't think it makes much 
difference to anyone.

&gt;<i>         The cvs repository is on SourceForge, and should be accesible via
</I>&gt;<i>cvs.jos.org.  e/m me for more information/whatever.  It would certainly
</I>&gt;<i>reduce the impression that decaf was *the* JOS JVM if there were more than
</I>&gt;<i>one of them in the CVS.  (Also, Robert, RJK isn't in the CVS.)  Having all
</I>&gt;<i>five in CVS would also make it easier to generate a sixth with the best
</I>&gt;<i>from all of them.]
</I>
In addition, probably just updating the KernelSummary would help.  The 
entire website needs some updating but I've just not had the time.
