<PRE>	About jos.* -- it's a 'public' namespace in the sense that the JOS
project owns it.  It seems evident that the 'proper' way to manage such a
namespace is by defining it terms of interfaces which specific programs
can subscribe to / replace.  (That is, there should probably only be /one/
process manager.  It makes sense for efficiency reasons for that process
manager just to replace the interfaces in jos.* with compliant
classes.)  I happen to think that the way decaf uses it is nice, but I'm
open to improvements, or just a pack-up-and-move operation.  It is further
my intent to use rheise.os as the interface when I implement multiple
java processes in decaf, so I will find someway that I'm comfortable with
for the two to co-exist.  This may or may not become the JOS
standard.  What that standard might be is another issue to discuss.

	Incidentally, most of the reason I haven't put any effort into
'standards' for JOS is the certain knowledge that they're going to change,
and change radically, by the time decaf (or other JVM) is ready.  It seems
more sensible to me to start with an interface that works and generalize
it than to create a general one and instantiate it.

	[Incidentally, I know of 3 JVMs that have been mentioned on this
list -- John ('pixie') Leuner's 'kissme', Robert Fitzsimmon's 'untitled',
and Todd L. Miller's decaf -- but only one is in CVS.  (Although I checked
some old logs and discovered that kissme has its own SF project and
repository.  If this suggests that decaf/JJOS should have its/their own
project, that's fine too...

	The cvs repository is on SourceForge, and should be accesible via
cvs.jos.org.  e/m me for more information/whatever.  It would certainly
reduce the impression that decaf was *the* JOS JVM if there were more than
one of them in the CVS.  (Also, Robert, RJK isn't in the CVS.)  Having all
five in CVS would also make it easier to generate a sixth with the best
from all of them.]
