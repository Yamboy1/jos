no.  In fact, only the &quot;committers&quot; which is extremely limited, must be 
SourceForge members.  Even &quot;developers&quot; that access the cvs don't need to 
be sourceforge members as they use anonymous cvs access.

&gt;<i>The JJOS subproject is the only subproject currently using SourceForge. It
</I>&gt;<i>is unnecessary for other subprojects to move to SourceForge, isn't it?
</I>
yes.  Sub projects or even other &quot;core&quot; projects (jjos replacement 
candidates) can be hosted anywhere.  SourceForge is simply the home of the 
JOS development online site which I, as the webmaster for jos, have 
setup.  jjos and any other &quot;core&quot; project is free to use the jos 
SourceForge project (and its cvs) to develop with.  However, for 
practicality reasons, what is happening is the &quot;lead&quot; core project is being 
hosted in the jos sourceforge, and other core projects (teaseme) is being 
hosted in their own SourceForge projects and then we'll use the website to 
link them together.  so if teaseme replaces jjos an the lead core jos 
project, then we'll probably have jjos get its own sourceforge project and 
host teaseme in the jos sourceforge cvs.

It seems hopelessly huge to try and host every project and subproject for 
jos so jos itself will only host the absolute core system.  THis follows 
linux where linux itself is really the development of the core 
kernel.  Everything else is developed separately elsewhere but links to 
these are provided and distributions are created to tie everything back 
together.

&gt;<i>I have decided not to become a member of SourceForge. The SourceForge
</I>&gt;<i>website does not work for me. In the past, I have contributed suggestions
</I>&gt;<i>and code to JJOS exclusively through e-mail. I use FTP, not CVS, to
</I>&gt;<i>distribute products.
</I>
This shouldn't be a problem.
