<PRE>On or around October 1, 2000, I will take a snapshot of the JJOS project
CVS on SourceForge. This will be the cornerstone of Release 1h of the JOS
Technical Edition.

(I would like to compile a binary edition on my own computer. I have been
unable to install a new compiler. My compiler won't compile the templates
used in JJOS.)

Meanwhile, volunteers are needed. Here is the challenge. How many members
will be able to compile the JJOS module from the snapshot? Even if you're
an expert CVS user, please download the snapshot and make certain it
compiles cleanly.

The following binary editions are requested:

- Linux(r)-compatible version (host mode)
- GRUB-compatible version (i386 mode)
- Etherboot-compatible version (i386 mode)

The following source edition is requested:

- decaf for Windows(tm)

We may have a PR problem. Many people want to believe that the JOS Project
is dead. What are we going to do about it? A binary edition of JJOS can
help. We can demonstrate that members of the JOS Project can work together
as a team. We can show everyone what has been accomplished.

When we have the latest binary editions of JJOS, it should be announced on
the JOS Project homepage. A binary edition is important. Anyone can take
JJOS for a test drive. Make it a stress-free test drive.

A binary edition enables any member to run JJOS even when they do not have
a full JJOS development environment. Members would like to see JJOS
running. We need to know what it can and can't do. Is this too much to ask?
