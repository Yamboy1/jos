Sorry if I missed your reply/follow-up.  Is there anything I can do to help
here?  What's the &quot;data structure&quot; that GRUB needs?  

I know that we do some, er, funky things in the build process (to arrive at a
&quot;raw&quot; executable), but I think that we leave a file for each step in the build
process around (e.g., the jjos-elf file is an ELF-format version of the eventual
&quot;raw&quot; or &quot;binary&quot; file).  If GRUB requires ELF files (rather than &quot;raw&quot; -- I
seem to recall it wanted ELF), we can nuke the ELF-&gt;raw conversion and use that
instead to build the GRUB file.  Barring that, there are lots of things that
&quot;objcopy&quot; can do...

Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help.  I get the feeling that
there are more people in the &quot;single machine&quot; developer camp than in the &quot;two
machines&quot; camp.  Getting GRUB up would more than double the number of people
that could help, so I'd venture to say that it's the single most important task
any of us is working on.  (Don't feel any pressure, or anything! :=)
