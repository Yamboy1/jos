<PRE>	&gt; Here are my outstanding problems:
	&gt; * The i386 build compiles, but the host build does not.  It is
complaining
	&gt; about missing a file: /etc/lib/gnu/types.h (or something like
that, I dont'
	&gt; have it in front of me.)  And lo and behold, the directory is
there, but not
	&gt; the file.  Am I missing an RPM?  If so, which one might that be?

	Ah.  You probably need to remake the &quot;dependencies&quot; in the Makefile
by building the &quot;depend&quot; target.  I seem to recall an issue concerning the
exact format of the &quot;Don't delete this line, makedepend depends upon it&quot;
between Todd's distribution and my RedHat one.  We should probably separate
out that into a separate &quot;included&quot; part of the Makefile so as to make this
easier.

	gnu/types.h is included by sys/types.h, and should be in
/usr/include (at least, on my slackware system.)  It should not be directly
included by any file in JJOS/decaf (which includes sys/types.h).

I did the make on the 'depend' target, but that didn't solve the problem.
Could someone please do a 
'rpm -q -f /usr/include/gnu/types.h' on their RedHat system and tell me what
package that belongs to?  it would help greatly.

Thanks,
Avery J. Regier
