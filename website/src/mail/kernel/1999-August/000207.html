	&gt;&gt; &gt; How about doing second-tier work?  Like, filesystem
implementations?
	&gt;&gt;
	&gt;&gt; Yes, that's a good possiblity. ext2fs would be a good starting
point. I
	&gt;&gt; might even learn something in the process :)
	&gt;&gt;
	&gt;&gt; (didn't someone write a FAT implementation a long time ago? I
think I've
	&gt;&gt; seen it on the Wiki ages ago when I was new to the project)
	&gt;
	&gt;Hmm.. can't recall...

	Yes, there was work done on this. Last I remember it was about a
year ago.
	I think that if we are going to do file system stuff, the best way
to start
	is have &quot;virtual/embedded file systems&quot;, where one file system is
stored as
	a big file in the parent file system.  This way we don't tromp on
the user's
	host system.  It would also enable us to easily build upon other
file
	systems (like having a FAT-16 system, with a ZIP compression system
above
	that, and above that one is a ext2fs), and also have RAM disks.

	This would mean publishing a file type with a raw disk I/O
interface.  Each
	disk device (including virtual device for file system and RAM) would
need an
	implementation of this type, becoming the driver.

	-Matt

Matt &amp; Peter,

Stephan Reich was leading this project a year ago.  He got to the point
where he had a filesystem API (it is pretty complete and well thought out)
and a driver written in Java for FAT16.  He also had a simple program for
viewing the FAT16 filesystem which was embedded in a file in your local file
system.  This should give you a good base to work on.

I have put the latest (I think) code that I have for it at:

Avery J. Regier
