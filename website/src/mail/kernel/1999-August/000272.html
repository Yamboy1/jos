OK, I'll bite.  Given that we pretty much don't distinguish interrupts
from IRQs, I'm guessing you mean interrupt handling is in a losing way. 
What, specifically?  What will you be cloning (native classes? 
bytecode?)?  How will cloning help?

I'm not even sure of the requirement to have virtual consoles, frankly. 
While it's a &quot;cool&quot; feature of Linux, UNIX (and just about every other
operating system out of the dozen or so ones I've ever seen or used in
over 20 years) gets along without it quite nicely.  Assuming I've
correctly figured out what you're talking about (no better than even
money, I'll wager), can't that wait?  Remember that all the native code
has got to fit between about 1K and 600K in memory.

&gt;<i> invoke methods in interp.cc with the error-checking/exceptions stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> *Sigh*...)  At any rate, I'm hoping to upload my stuff to CVS in the

</I>
I was planning to hook up the GC stuff this weekend.  By the flurry of
email from me today, I am sure you can tell I'm at home hacking away,
and not at the Day Job (and I won't be again until Monday).
