At least writing windowing software would be possible, then...

</I>
Well, &quot;real&quot; drivers will be impossible to do under Linux.  Perhaps we can
resurrect Robert's GRUB work...  Would it be OK if you could recompile the
jjos+decaf &quot;kernel&quot; and reboot your Linux box?  It would be tedious, but it
would be workable...

&gt;<i> My problem is that I don't any a computer I can play with (as in screwing

</I>&gt;<i> much unless I can do it in Linux :)
</I>
How about doing second-tier work?  Like, filesystem implementations?  I think
maybe we could use &quot;raw&quot; disk I/O (I seem to recall something about this being
possible in Linux -- bypassing the kernel caches...).  What would be necessary
to pull this off is arch-specific bytecode (we can already do arch-specific
native code).
