<PRE>Hi

On Mon, 30 Aug 1999, John Morrison wrote:

&gt;<i> Progress:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (1) Todd implemented: synchronized methods in the JVM; virtual consoles in a
</I>&gt;<i> java daemon.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (2) Thomas Bocek found a bug in two of the JVM's opcodes -- irem, and idiv. 
</I>&gt;<i> Either Todd or jm will integrate his fix with the other active mods to the JVM. 
</I>&gt;<i> Will probably be committed to CVS within a day or two.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (3) CVS pserver has been acting up again.  Todd was kind enough to restart the
</I>&gt;<i> server again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (4) jm implemented an unbelievably slow (but working), malloc-free memory
</I>&gt;<i> manager.  Implements hybrid best/first-fit, with sentinel words to try and
</I>&gt;<i> detect writing over the end of blocks, and with status bits to detect
</I>&gt;<i> multiple-freeing.  Todd and jm used it to detect and fix two memory-management
</I>&gt;<i> bugs in the JVM.  This capability and the bug fixes have not yet been committed
</I>&gt;<i> to CVS because of a problem with the i386 build.
</I>
(5) finihed the vga-routine / bitblt / stop and integrated this into a new
device structure (structures done: general device/graphic device)
 
&gt;<i> Ongoing, not-yet-complete efforts:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (1) Todd has begun to implement throws/exceptions in the JVM.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (2) The combined jjos+decaf+GC dies shortly after the first GC.  George Marrows
</I>&gt;<i> and jm are looking into this.  (Fixing the memory management bugs mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> above unfortunately had no effect on this problem.)  Scheduling constraints will
</I>&gt;<i> likely preclude any resolution before late this weekend.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (3) jm ran into a problem with the i386 build while verifying code changes prior
</I>&gt;<i> to CVS commitment.  jm's P5 box complains about not having CPUID implemented. 
</I>&gt;<i> Weird, because that's the box the CPUID code was debugged upon.  (Anybody else
</I>&gt;<i> seen this?)  Resolution no earlier than Thursday due to schedule constraints.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (4) Todd and jm are looking into integrating GNU classpath (so we can have
</I>&gt;<i> sources to help us debug the low-level classes -- right now we have no idea
</I>&gt;<i> what's going to be called except through time-consuming trial-and-error with
</I>&gt;<i> Sun's JDK -- plus we can't redistribute it.  This is also preventing us from
</I>&gt;<i> making a key, &quot;Right Thing To Do&quot; change to the JVM to radically speed-up Java
</I>&gt;<i> method calls.).  jm has already contacted key classpath developers via email and
</I>&gt;<i> gotten their go-ahead.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As usual, please reply to me and/or the list with any errors of either omission
</I>&gt;<i> or commission.
</I>
(5) upload my work to CVS (never done this before!)

(6) I found a very good (and free) documentation about FDC programming. I
think I take a look on this.
