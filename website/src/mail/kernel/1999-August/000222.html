<PRE>Hi All;

With all due respect, in traditional monolithic, own-address-space kernels, they
directly relate in that the kernel *defines* the driver architecture/API.  Even
though
 jjos+decaf is NOT a traditional kernel
 jjos+decaf is NOT a traditional kernel
 jjos+decaf is NOT a traditional kernel
 jjos+decaf is NOT a traditional kernel
 jjos+decaf is NOT a traditional kernel
 jjos+decaf is NOT a traditional kernel
the driver architecture absolutely *still* relates to jjos+decaf.  I think
(based upon my reading of your email), the rest of your message reinforces this
view...

&gt;<i> Actually, for Device architecture (from a nearly nieve perspective), I see
</I>&gt;<i> only two major hooks needed to join the kernel to the drivers:
</I>&gt;<i>    (1) Pat down the hardware resource interface to a point where somebody is

</I>&gt;<i> people beyond us.
</I>&gt;<i>    (2) Create a hook where the devices can detect and install themselves.
</I>&gt;<i> This is basically the &quot;main&quot; method of the OS, I feel (though it could be
</I>&gt;<i> something else too).  This is also a link into the registry and other cans
</I>&gt;<i> of worms.  But still, the kernel group (I feel) need only be conserned with
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;main&quot; routine link.  If I'm not mistaken, this already exists.
</I>
Having said that, a couple of points... I *still* think we ought to satisfy your
two needs by using the JavaOS API as defined in the &quot;Device Driver Guide,&quot;
available at the following NEW URL (the old one now gets redirected to a place
without the documents):

<A HREF="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/products/JavaOS/TechDocs/index.html">http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/products/JavaOS/TechDocs/index.html</A>

BTW, please notice that I think you can also DOWNLOAD (?!?!?!) JavaOS from this
page!  (The page info says it was last modified on the 7th...)
