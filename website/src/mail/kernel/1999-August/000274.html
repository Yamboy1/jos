<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt;         Great, this is a good reason to use the JavaOS APIs.  (BTW, our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IRQ handling is in dire need of fixing, so I'll go ahead and clone that
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, I'll bite.  Given that we pretty much don't distinguish interrupts
</I>&gt;<i> from IRQs, I'm guessing you mean interrupt handling is in a losing way. 
</I>&gt;<i> What, specifically?  What will you be cloning (native classes? 
</I>&gt;<i> bytecode?)?  How will cloning help?
</I>
	Er, I phrased this poorly because we don't distinguish between
IRQ's and interrupts.  Basically, we don't currently use
InterrupterDispatcher at all.  This induces a hack in the keyboard driver
that will lose scancodes if &gt;1 is generated per interrupt.  This might be
'fixable' by re-implementing InterrupterDispatcher.  However, I don't know
how much work this might entail, and as long as you're cloning the JavaOS
APIs for memory, I might as well clone the APIs for IRQs/interrupts.
(Rather, clone the parts that I need.)

&gt;<i> I'm not even sure of the requirement to have virtual consoles, frankly. 
</I>&gt;<i> While it's a &quot;cool&quot; feature of Linux, UNIX (and just about every other
</I>&gt;<i> operating system out of the dozen or so ones I've ever seen or used in
</I>&gt;<i> over 20 years) gets along without it quite nicely.  Assuming I've
</I>&gt;<i> correctly figured out what you're talking about (no better than even
</I>&gt;<i> money, I'll wager), can't that wait?  Remember that all the native code
</I>&gt;<i> has got to fit between about 1K and 600K in memory.
</I>
	Er, these virtual consoles are implemented entirely in Java, and
besides being &quot;cool&quot; (and wonderful for debugging), it's a good test of
the driver system.  If the VGA driver ends up doing our text-display work
(and/or includes a text/video mode switch), I can use that method/code to
(help) handle switching the consoles. 

&gt;<i> I was planning to hook up the GC stuff this weekend.  By the flurry of
</I>&gt;<i> email from me today, I am sure you can tell I'm at home hacking away,
</I>&gt;<i> and not at the Day Job (and I won't be again until Monday).
</I>
	Hey, great, anything that makes my job easier :)
