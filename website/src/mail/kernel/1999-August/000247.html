OK.  Does anybody have this checking on his To-Do list?

I sent an email to several individual classpath developers last night, but have
not received a reply yet.  However, I stupidly failed to send it to the official
&quot;classpath&quot; mailing list, because I had been corresponding with these guys
off-and-on for the last couple of months and just figured I'd keep it personal. 
Also, the classpath web site hasn't changed (according to the reported &quot;age&quot; of
the pages) since February (although some of the CVS files seem to be vintage
mid-June).  I hope this doesn't mean the project died.  That would be dreadful.

Has anybody out there in JOS-land heard anything from these guys?

If I don't get anything back from them by sometime later this afternoon, I'll
contact them again.
