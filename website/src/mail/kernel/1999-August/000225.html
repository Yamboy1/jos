<PRE>Hi Guys;

Could Todd, Thomas, and Hilary (sp?) please do me some favors?

Todd: You said you'd like to refetch the sources (instead of trying to
merge your obsolete set).  Would you please be so kind as to do it, and
let me know if I broke anything (esp makefiles)?  I should've made all
the fixes you asked me to.  I am just worried that maybe I broke
something as judged by the output of the testVM procedures.  If I did,
just let me know which ones I broke, and I will fix them (I'm not trying
to throw any such problems over the wall to you).

Thomas and/or Hilary: Would you please be so kind as to let me know if
you notice a speed-up in the performance of the built-in methods?  An
approximate figure and/or subjective impression would be good. If the
current level of performance proves to be unacceptable, I think the next
step is to implement the JavaOS memory classes.  They have a method in
one of the memory object that basically &quot;setBytes&quot; a whole bunch of
bytes to a given value.  This should be easier now that there is a way
of adding built-in methods without increasing the overhead (much if at
all) for each additional such built-in.  Also, adding such built-ins is
now divorced from the basic machinery of the JVM, so it should also be
more straightforward to do so.

Everybody else:  Please let me know if I have inadvertantly caused any
problems, and let me know via email to the list (it's more important
that everybody know there's a problem right away than it is to protect
my dignity via a private email).

Thanks, especially to those brave souls writing drivers!  Let me know if
there's anything I can do to help!

-jm
