<PRE>	John / Todd - 

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; That's OK.  I'm assuming we can just recompile it with the C++
</I>&gt;<i> compiler
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (it's ANSI C, right?) and link it on in.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         [GAM] Yes it should compile fine with g++ (I'll check this).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK.  Just let us all know!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>	[GAM]  Hmm.. plenty of warnings about doing arithmetic with void*.
I'll sort them out.

&gt;<i> That's great!  Hopefully, we'll have something with which it can be
</I>&gt;<i> integrated
</I>&gt;<i> (Todd and I can thus be advised to be sure to finish anything we start by
</I>&gt;<i> roughly the 14th).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>	[GAM]  I propose to put the gc code in a separate directory:
common/nativecode/gc. How does that sound? It's currently in
common/nativecode, but it bloats that directory somewhat. Now I've just got
to sort out the accursed makefile :-(

&gt;<i> &gt; In the meantime, it would be very useful if you could go through the
</I>&gt;<i> kernel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and decaf and identify the roots for garbage collection. Issues I
</I>&gt;<i> foresee
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK.  We'll start that effort...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>	[GAM]  I'll see if I can work out a modified interface for jbheap
earlier than the 14th. It needs to allow the rest of JJOS pass back
information about roots and kick off an on-demand garbage collect, in
addition to jbheap's current allocate functionality.

&gt;<i> &gt; with this: do we need to look in registers; how to find top and bottom
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the native code stack for scanning.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm thinking with green threads we won't have to, but that's based upon a
</I>&gt;<i> whole
</I>&gt;<i> 10 seconds of thought...  Todd, what sayest thou?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>	[GAM]  But if I'm also doing gc for the C++ code, and the only ref
to some C++ heap object is in a local variable somewhere on the native code
stack, I'll need to find that ref. Otherwise that object is gone (or rather,
the memory for it doesn't get marked as in use and could end up being reused
for something else, which in turn could lead to some very nasty bugs).
