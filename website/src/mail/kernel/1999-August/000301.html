<PRE>&gt;<i> Well, I found two bugs in JVM.
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Date Object -- When I create Date Object, JJOS Kernel will got some
</I>&gt;<i> behaivour. (Show lots of Zero on the screen.)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. String -- String can't perform chatAt and getBytes, toCharArray
</I>&gt;<i> So I can't draw Character on VGA from a Java String.
</I>
	As I've already noted, we're not working with a fully-functional
class library.  #2 should be a (relatively) quick fix of adding
&quot;arraycopy&quot; to the builtins...

&gt;<i> For 'consoled' daemon, is it a Console Driver for System.out ?
</I>
	No.  It's a daemon that (for now?) is the only consumer of the
keyboard's KeyEvents; after checking if it's a KeyEvent that causes the
console to switch (which fires FocusEvents), it redirects the KeyEvent to
the currently-focused console.  (Actually, KeyListener, so things like
telnet should just fit right in.)

&gt;<i> I would like to know, is the current keyboard emulation fully funtional ?
</I>&gt;<i> Since I havn't try to test it in my computer.
</I>
	Yes and no.  It will convince the keyboard driver that it's
talking to a real keyboard, but one that can only generate the single
scancode you've hard-coded into it.  Some raw-mode hack should be possible
to make the Right Thing happen...

&gt;<i> Any Conservative GC has been already implemented ? If so, we can port it
</I>&gt;<i> to JJOS, it can save time on it.
</I>
	Yes, we're working on integrating a conservative that was
generously written for us by George Marrows.
