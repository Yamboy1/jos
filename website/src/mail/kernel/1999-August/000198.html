<PRE>Hi;

Note to Thomas (et al); I plan to check his fixes in today ...

Actually, using GRUB you could do single-host (no Etherboot)
development...  You'd build a new jjos+decaf image in GRUB format, then
reboot your Linux box to boot the jjos+decaf ...  more tedious than
using Etherboot, but then one could make do with just a single box...

&gt;<i> &gt; How about doing second-tier work?  Like, filesystem implementations?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that's a good possiblity. ext2fs would be a good starting point. I

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (didn't someone write a FAT implementation a long time ago? I think I've
</I>&gt;<i> seen it on the Wiki ages ago when I was new to the project)
</I>
Hmm.. can't recall...

&gt;<i> &gt;I think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maybe we could use &quot;raw&quot; disk I/O (I seem to recall something about this being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible in Linux -- bypassing the kernel caches...).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is, but I'm not sure how yet. I'll try to find out... hopefully one
</I>&gt;<i> won't need a 2.2 kernel (I'm on 2.0).
</I>
OK.  Let me know what we can do...

&gt;<i> &gt;What would be necessary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to pull this off is arch-specific bytecode (we can already do arch-specific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; native code).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm. You mean some sort of alternative (with less overhead) to JNI? Beats
</I>&gt;<i> me. But I guess it needs to be done. How much overheard *is* involved in
</I>&gt;<i> JNI? Doing JNI method calls for every disk access might become slow pretty
</I>&gt;<i> quickly, even with caching. Or am I misstaken?
</I>
Well, that's kind of what we're doing now...  (actually, we're doing
stuff that's even slower because we look up methods in a linear
fashion)...
