<PRE>Hi Thomas;

The &lt;00000000&gt; things are actually interrupts (?!) -- interrupt zero, actually
-- that occur but have no registered/assigned handler routine.  And, of course,
I don't have my books in front of me now, so I can't tell you what interrupt
that is.  I'll check up on this.  Weird.

The only error the heap currently can detect is an &quot;out of memory&quot; error.  Is
this the other problem you're seeing?

&gt;<i> BTW the line:
</I>&gt;<i> String[][] test={{&quot;0x0D10&quot;,&quot;test&quot;,&quot;Matrox Impression Plus&quot;,&quot;test&quot;}};
</I>&gt;<i> does an jbHeap::allocate error too.
</I>
Hmm...  Either the heap really thinks it's out of memory, or it could be a bug
in the Java array stuff (which is kind of built-in).

Might I be so bold as to ask you to please let me and/or Todd know about such
easily-reproducible errors?  They're wonderful in that they will help us to
debug jjos and decaf, and it sure is better to track down bugs like that than it
is to let them quietly lie dormant until the rear up and bite us on the
collective ass.

Thanks!  I'll look into both of these ASAP (probably Thursday at the earliest,
Friday at the latest).

By the way, George (Hi, George!) was kind enough to send me a cut at the
conservative GC heap implementation, which I'll also be looking into ASAP. 
Hopefully, jjos+decaf should stay up long enough to be &quot;interesting&quot; after it's
integrated.
