<PRE>Here is a news item that is very important to us. IBM and Sun has killed the
JavaOS initiative. There is a section on this news at Slashdot.org. There is
nothing on Javalobby, which is make me feel that this becoming more and more
a joke of a information portal IMHO... Here is a link to the story

I think the group needs to reply to this news item. At end of this message I
have added rough idea of a press release that the group might release.

would appear that our group should follow the slashdot org thread. I
dontrack of comments and publish a reply. This would bring this project to
peoples attention, and possible get some press for the project, which now
appears to be the only JavaOS.

I think with all hopla around Linux, I think we need to describe why JOS is
better than Linux on the desktop. I know that this is key question that I
have for the group.

Later,

Idea for press release...

                                            ---- 00 ----

Open Source JavaOS Team responds to IBM and Sun's JavaOS for Business
announcement

August 21 1999 -
The Java Open Source OS group is disappointed with the news that IBM and Sun
have announced the disconituation of the JavaOS for Business. There is still
an important need for JavaOS in several key markets. As Anne Thomas, an
analyst with The Patricia Seybold Group stated in the ZDNN article.  JavaOS
&quot;...was a really nice solution.&quot; As this news story points our there is
still a large customer intrest in this option.

Our team wishes to extend our an offer to help transition folks from the IBM
and Sun soluton to our JavaOS development. We also welcome developers,
indivuals, and companies that wish to help with our project.

We will also be releasing a detail responce for developers, for managers,
and for the press in near future.

JOS is an Open Source project that goal is to create an Open Source version
of the JavaOS. More background blah, blah, blah...
