<PRE>Hi All,


&gt;<i>Hi Thomas;

My testing is much similar to Thomas one. The speed has been improved
after I upgraded the kernel.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The results aren't exact, because

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. made the test with a stop-watch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. the old source crashed after 7 sec, and the screen was only 1/5

&gt;&gt;<i> the new source crashes after the screen is 4/5 filled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The Crash means the VGA class stop filling screen.

What I have done, I have made some changes on Thomas VGA class.
1. I am trying to make generic interface for Graphics Adapator
2. I added some variables after method call.
i.e.
original one : jos.system.machine.write8(0xaffff, 0);
modified one : short temp = jos.system.machine.write8(0xaffff, 0);

After modifying, the VGA can fill up whole screen without any problem. But
the color on the screen are same color of check mark -_-. I will check it
later.

Also, I have made a memfill routine. It can speed up VGA filling much much a
lots.

For the crash(I use old code), I think the problem is stack overflow. Since
the routine got no problem (it can fill up). I have tried to fill up with
different counter value. When more pixels
are filled, it will hangs very easy. If I fill up a few pixels, it got no
problems.

&gt;<i>OK, so if I were to extrapolate, the old one would finish in 35 seconds
</I>&gt;<i>(barring a crash - HA), and the new one would finish in about 7 seconds
</I>&gt;<i>(barring a crash), right?  So, this means we've speeded up the
</I>&gt;<i>calls-to-native code about 5 times, eh?  If so, is performance creeping
</I>&gt;<i>into the &quot;acceptable for now&quot; range (At least, until we do the
</I>&gt;<i>JavaOS-style memory classes -- I'm also curious as to why the write32
</I>&gt;<i>stuff is SLOWER -- can you try that one, too?)?  If so, is the
</I>&gt;<i>memory-management stuff now the hottest fire?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>With respect to the crash:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>(1) When my version hangs after displaying the checkmark, is that the
</I>&gt;<i>crash's failure mode?  I mean, is this the same &quot;crash&quot; you're getting?
</I>&gt;<i>If so, I can try and debug it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>(2) Do you think it would help if I wrote something that, in the case of
</I>&gt;<i>a detectable crash, reset the VGA display to text mode and spat out some
</I>&gt;<i>debugging info?  (Our own little BSOD!  What color should I make the
</I>&gt;<i>screen?)  I could print out:
</I>&gt;<i>(a) a diagnostic string
</I>&gt;<i>(b) the native-code stacktrace (with &quot;nm&quot; you could see where in the JVM
</I>&gt;<i>we were)
</I>&gt;<i>(c) and maybe some other Java stuff (I'd have to think about how to do
</I>&gt;<i>this, and fit it on one screen -- there could be quite a few Java
</I>&gt;<i>threads -- too many to fit on one screen)
</I>&gt;<i>We don't have enough of a console/GUI/Window Mgr for me to do anything
</I>&gt;<i>else, right?
</I>
for debugging, I think we should modified VGA Class to be a Graphical
Console.
(Draw Characters pixel by pixel like Linux Frame Buffer Console). Then we
can
print debugging information on screen.

&gt;<i>Again, thanks for the help -- I appreciate how, er, hostile the
</I>&gt;<i>debugging environment is at this point in time!  I shall endeavor to
</I>&gt;<i>make it less so.
</I>&gt;<i>
