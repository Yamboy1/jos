I think we're on the same page.  Basically, we'll get green threads running, and
if native threads is the next-hottest fire, then we'll put that one out.

&gt;<i>         [GAM]  With the heap as it currently is, there's nothing I can do
</I>&gt;<i> with the information that a piece of memory is free *now* -- this info is

</I>&gt;<i> explicit frees, I'll try to work that into a later version.
</I>
OK.  Nulling-out-pointers it is...

&gt;<i>         [GAM]  The VM tricks also seem useful when doing generational GC --
</I>&gt;<i> they can be used to implement a write barrier to track pointers to younger
</I>&gt;<i> generations.
</I>
Exactly my understanding.

&gt;<i> &gt; That's OK.  I'm assuming we can just recompile it with the C++ compiler
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (it's ANSI C, right?) and link it on in.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         [GAM] Yes it should compile fine with g++ (I'll check this).
</I>
OK.  Just let us all know!

&gt;<i>         [GAM]  Apart from the lack of support for large objects (well, not
</I>&gt;<i> so large actually: &gt;1/2 page) and no way of handling mark stack overflow,
</I>&gt;<i> it's pretty much getting there. (I managed to get it to allocate and
</I>&gt;<i> conservatively scan some noddy C structures at the weekend.) As mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> above, I've haven't put any thought into handling explicit frees, and I'm
</I>&gt;<i> loath to spend time turning it into an allocate/deallocate heap, cos that
</I>&gt;<i> will inevitably detract from progress elsewhere. I would very much hope to
</I>&gt;<i> have something that GCs correctly (albeit slowly) by, say, the 14th of this
</I>&gt;<i> month. This would include the large object support, but maybe not deal with
</I>
That's great!  Hopefully, we'll have something with which it can be integrated
(Todd and I can thus be advised to be sure to finish anything we start by
roughly the 14th).

&gt;<i> the mark stack overflow. If I haven't managed to get this far by then, I'll
</I>
Yeah, I think we're OK there.  Any improved marking-space improvements can
certainly wait.

&gt;<i> happily hand over the code for completion by people with more time /
</I>&gt;<i> speedier coding skills. I hope this is a usable timescale for you and Todd.
</I>
You betcha.  It's a lot faster than either of us can come up with one...

&gt;<i> In the meantime, it would be very useful if you could go through the kernel
</I>&gt;<i> and decaf and identify the roots for garbage collection. Issues I foresee
</I>
OK.  We'll start that effort...

&gt;<i> with this: do we need to look in registers; how to find top and bottom of
</I>&gt;<i> the native code stack for scanning.
</I>
I'm thinking with green threads we won't have to, but that's based upon a whole
10 seconds of thought...  Todd, what sayest thou?

BTW, I'll be out of touch through Wednesday night at the earliest...

Thanks for the help!
