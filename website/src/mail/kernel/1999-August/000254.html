<PRE>&gt;<i> Last night, after a year of waiting for Linux to finally work with my
</I>&gt;<i> hardware and other assorted challenges, I was finally able to get almost
</I>&gt;<i> everything in the tool chain to compile!
</I>
	Hey, congratulations!

&gt;<i> I had to make some changes in the
</I>&gt;<i> mknbi-jos Makefile and mknbi.c to get mknbi to compile with Etherboot 4.2.?.
</I>
	Hm.  I'm currently using Etherboot-4.2 without any changes,
though I'll admit it's been a while since I compiled mknbi-jos.

&gt;<i> I also found that a few things in the tool chain are undocumented.  For
</I>&gt;<i> instance, I had to get the blackdown JDK, but no where in the docs was that
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned, and no mention of what version was required and/or known to work
</I>&gt;<i> either.  I ended up getting the latest (1.1.7v3) and it compiles, though I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know about running yet.
</I>
	The only part of the JDK that decaf/JJOS should require is the
classfile, and that dependency will disappear when we start distributing
classpath with the source, which will be whenever we (finally) integrate
it.

	bootp is for etherboot, newer versions of which should support
DHCP using the -DDHCP_SUPPORT compile option.  (see
etherboot-4.2/doc/text/README.txt).  

&gt;<i> Here are my outstanding problems:
</I>&gt;<i> * The i386 build compiles, but the host build does not.  It is complaining
</I>&gt;<i> about missing a file: /etc/lib/gnu/types.h (or something like that, I dont'
</I>&gt;<i> have it in front of me.)  And lo and behold, the directory is there, but not
</I>&gt;<i> the file.  Am I missing an RPM?  If so, which one might that be?
</I>
	gnu/types.h is included by sys/types.h, and should be in
/usr/include (at least, on my slackware system.)  It should not be
directly included by any file in JJOS/decaf (which includes sys/types.h).

&gt;<i> * I was able to build the floppy and I tried to boot JJOS over my home
</I>&gt;<i> network, but for some reason it couldn't find my NIC.  Was there maybe a
</I>&gt;<i> configuration step that I could have been missing?  What are the standard
</I>&gt;<i> steps you need to go through to get that to work reliably  I am reasonably
</I>&gt;<i> sure I have the right driver (Tulip) for my NIC.
</I>
	Be aware with the tulip driver that some of Netgear's cards need
Netgear's tulip driver because the aren't the same chips as they used to
be.  If that's not it, the same README referenced above notes that the
tulip driver isn't well tested, and essentially needs to be written to
include each particular specifically.  It might be worth the money in
terms of time saved just to pick up a cheap PCI NE2000 clone...

&gt;<i> I also learned yesterday that the maker of one of my video cards (NVIDIA)
</I>&gt;<i> has released OS-independent source code for the driver with loads of
</I>&gt;<i> documentation.  There is a good chance of my being able to massage that into
</I>&gt;<i> a driver for JJOS.  I will need GRUB first, because that video card is on my
</I>&gt;<i> host machine, not the slave.
</I>
	I believe that someone is working on GRUB right now.  If not, and
anyone is interested, _please_ go ahead.

&gt;<i> I'm looking forward to actually seeing this thing run and be able to
</I>&gt;<i> contribute!
</I>
	I'm looking forward to seeing your stuff.  Hope I helped here.
(Oh, BTW, if you've got specific suggestions for the docs, just right them
into the docs and send them along -- I'll drop the changes into CVS.)
