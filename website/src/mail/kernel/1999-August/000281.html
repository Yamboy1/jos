Hmm... I vaguely and fuzzily recall something about this.  Was the &quot;bug&quot;
or misfeature in the native code, the Java, or in the interaction
between the two?

&gt;<i> how much work this might entail, and as long as you're cloning the JavaOS

</I>
Ah.  Cloning the APIs.  (Well, I guess I misread subject, verb, and
object of your description.  Three in one sentence.  Pretty much
everything -- didn't miss a single chance to misintepret something. 
This is some sort of personal record. :=)

&gt;<i>         Er, these virtual consoles are implemented entirely in Java, and
</I>&gt;<i> besides being &quot;cool&quot; (and wonderful for debugging), it's a good test of

(Well, I'm 2 for 2 here.  Thought you were talking about native code.)

&gt;<i> &gt; I was planning to hook up the GC stuff this weekend.  By the flurry of

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and not at the Day Job (and I won't be again until Monday).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         Hey, great, anything that makes my job easier :)
</I>
Let's hope my C++ and Java are better than my English.

Embarrassedly Yours,
