I don't actually use either Kaffe or blackdown (I could never seem to get Kaffe
happy anything), but instead use the &quot;guavac&quot; Java compiler which comes with
RedHat 6.0.

Hmm...  I am using stock RedHat 6.0, and bootp is there and works fine (I think
I had to enable it via either chkconfig or linuxconf).

</I>
Like I said, I am using RedHat 6.0 with the existing toolchain.  I'll be more
than happy to help you get this working.  I do not think that there should be
any issue with respect to the version of NASM you're using -- we don't really do
anything, er, creative with it (I think there's only some 300 lines of asm).  I
*do* know there *are* problems with pre-4.0 Etherboot (related to the maximum
workable size of the downloaded image, and, at 9MB, we're pretty much pushing
the envelope).

&gt;<i> Here are my outstanding problems:
</I>&gt;<i> * The i386 build compiles, but the host build does not.  It is complaining
</I>&gt;<i> about missing a file: /etc/lib/gnu/types.h (or something like that, I dont'
</I>&gt;<i> have it in front of me.)  And lo and behold, the directory is there, but not
</I>&gt;<i> the file.  Am I missing an RPM?  If so, which one might that be?
</I>
Ah.  You probably need to remake the &quot;dependencies&quot; in the Makefile by building
the &quot;depend&quot; target.  I seem to recall an issue concerning the exact format of
the &quot;Don't delete this line, makedepend depends upon it&quot; between Todd's
distribution and my RedHat one.  We should probably separate out that into a
separate &quot;included&quot; part of the Makefile so as to make this easier.

&gt;<i> * I was able to build the floppy and I tried to boot JJOS over my home
</I>&gt;<i> network, but for some reason it couldn't find my NIC.  Was there maybe a
</I>&gt;<i> configuration step that I could have been missing?  What are the standard
</I>&gt;<i> steps you need to go through to get that to work reliably  I am reasonably
</I>&gt;<i> sure I have the right driver (Tulip) for my NIC.
</I>
There is a configuration step in how you build the floppy -- you must also &quot;dd&quot;
onto the floppy the right NIC-specific driver (the directions that come with
Etherboot explain this).  Please also be advised that somebody else (I forget
who) uses Netboot instead, which uses NDIS packet-drivers (which I understand
are easier to come by) instead of custom assembly drivers.  Either should work
fine.

&gt;<i> * The above DHCP vs. bootp question.
</I>
I am using BOOTP.  I do not know of anybody who has successfully used DHCP. 
(Hell, I don't know anybody who even *tried*.)

&gt;<i> I'm looking forward to actually seeing this thing run and be able to
</I>&gt;<i> contribute!
</I>
Great!  Let me know what else I can do to help!
