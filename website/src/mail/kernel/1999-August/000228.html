I would venture to say the DLL/DSO native libraries are not on the
horizon for now.  There are so many other things that need doing that
native libraries have fallen over (beyond?) the horizon.  (Like, maybe
getting to the point where we can run an interesting Java program at
all?)

On the off-chance that this is a performance-related need: the solution
to bad performance should be better performance (e.g., optimized JVM,
JIT, HotSpot, etc.), not native libraries.  JNI should be used to get to
large, pre-existing machine-dependent code bases (e.g., OpenGL), of
which we have none for JOS.

On a more concrete level, the solution I have is not optimal (although
it's better than the Order(N) performing solution it replaced), and it
doesn't extend to native libraries well. This is, in part, because I
don't have access to rebuildable Sun JDK sources, and we're not yet
using GNU classpath.  Right now, we're trapping calls to non-native
methods, which means I can't just see if the resolved_method is native,
and only THEN look up the built-in method in the hashtable.  I have to
pre-screen all the calls to ALL methods, and then trap to the overriding
built-in.  I figure I've got two options:

(1) If we use GNU classpath, we can simply make the built-ins &quot;native&quot;
Java methods, and then we can change those 10 (or so) lines of code in
the JVM, and make things run much faster.  (I think this is the Right
Way to do this.)  Much later (in the distant future?) we could extend
this to write a whole bunch of code to intern native methods, and use
that same mechanism.

(2) If we don't want to wait that long, alternatively, I think I could
force a loading of all the classes for which I have built-in methods,
and then traverse the resolved method tables and find and hammer all the
ones I want to be overriden with &quot;native&quot; methods.  This one would
entail some changes to the decaf initialization (slowing it down, and
being more memory-consumptive, because we'd have to load all these
classes whether we needed them or not -- don't know how many this is),
and to the method-invocation machinery (I think).

&gt;<i> things, I've been hammering away at decaf (mostly interp.cc), writing in

OK.  I hope I haven't changed things too much so that you can't easily
find your way around!  Once we plug in the memory management stuff,
things should be much better!
