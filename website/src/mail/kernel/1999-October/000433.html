<PRE>	Right now, the kernel code simply queues up interrupts until the
interperter gets around to asking if any interrupts had happened while it
busy doing java things.  (Reasoning: we don't have multitasking/threading
yet, because it's rather difficult, so we can't context-switch to an
interperter running the interrupt code; it would be too difficult to be
worthwhile to make the interperter interruptable; and this way offers a
fast turn-around to the hardware, so interrupts don't get lost in the
kernel.)  

	The interperter than looks at the queue before (after) every set
(currently one) of java bytecodes executed (i.e. when the interperter is
known to be in a safe state).  If there's an interrupt waiting to be
handled, the scheduler (in a hideously inefficient manner) extracts the
proper (static) interrupt object in the interrupts class it's been passed,
and calls notifyAll() on it, which schedules the thread(s) wait()ing on
that interrupt to run.

	The problem is two-fold: first, notifyAll() appends threads to the
scheduled list, rather than inserting them.  (i.e., the interrupt handling
thread(s) is (are) not prioritized.)  Second, this method is prone to
having the interrupt handlers lose interrupts.  If an interrupt handler
doesn't wait() on the interrupt object before the next interrupt occurs,
it's gone.  (Threading the response doesn't help, because the same logic
applies.)  (This, in addition to the fact that a single thread can't
listen for more than one interrupt this way.)

	While there are any number of interesting ways to tackle this,
they all have to do two things: 1, throw the interrupts 'over the wall*'
to the Java code so the Right Things can happen; 2, arrange for the Java
code not to lose interrupts.  Two solutions immediately present
themselves.  First, using the MappedMemory extension**, construct an
interrupt table (list/vector/etc) and have some java scheduler thread sit
around and check it for changes.  When it dispatches an interrupt, it just
notes that change and moves along.  Second, declare a function (say,
jos.system.machine.handleInterrupt(int num)) to be &quot;well known&quot; and call
it whenever an interrupt happens, and let the java code queue/stack/etc up
the interrupts and schedule them however it sees fit.  (Which should be
add/removeInterruptListener &amp; event-based, IMHO.)

	The third possibility is a hybrid of the two.  Have a well-known
class, say jos.system.machine, which has [add|remove]InterruptListener
methods adding listeners to a well-known (constant static***) array of
vectors therein. The kernel can then extract this information and schedule
the interested threads appropriately (i.e. at the top of the queue,
aborting the current thread).  This solution is efficient, exposes the
internals of the scheduler minimally to the Java, and imposes minimal
restrictions on the Java code.  Combined with a timer mechanism
(jos.system.machine.setTimer()?) (and native support for it!), this should
make the driver writers' jobs much simpler.  It should also translate
pretty closely into the JavaOS/B model whenever we might implement it.

	Commentary?  I'm planning on doing a clean checkout of the CVS
tree and making sure things work right 'out of the box' and discovering
what all changes I've been making piece-meal should actual be committed.
After that, I'd like to fix interrupts and the keyboard driver.  I do not,
however, have any kind of time-line for these projects...

P.S.: JM, have you committed the new gc stuff to CVS yet?

* More on 'the wall' later.  I've been doing some ruminations about
garbage collection, involving allocating java and c memory differently,
among other things.  (I'm thinking the right name for what I'm fiddling
with for the java stack would be &quot;fractional mark and sweep&quot;, but don't
hold it to me -- I'm not a gc expert, yet :))

** Returns a Java array at a certain h/w address.  Useful for things like
VGA buffers and DMA transfers.  Not implemented yet.

*** i.e., for efficiency, if we cache the pointer to the vector, it will
always be right.
