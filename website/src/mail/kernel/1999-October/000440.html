<PRE>Hi Corrado and all --

I spent my weekend getting jjos to boot using GRUB, which it now does (I
think). Some problems:

a) I haven't yet figured how to define the makefile targets (etherboot /
GRUB) correctly so that they can both be built using the same makefile.
Differences are that GRUB leaves you in protected mode (affects head.s86)
and it loads the ramdisk low rather than high a la etherboot (affects
entry.cc). Command line and available memory fetch are different too.

b) (for those that are interested) Bochs booting doesn't work. This isn't
jjos's fault - I just haven't managed yet to create a hard disk image file
that looks sufficiently like a correctly partitioned disk to fool GRUB --
this is needed to load jjos_common.zip. Apparently VSTa now boots under
Bochs, and I know it uses GRUB so I'll see what they've done.

c) What's the correct behaviour for the boot? I get the standard text
messages (same as host build), then the screen blanks and the JOS logo
appears. However, the screen blanks again a few seconds later and a series
of error messages repeat up the screen. I'm afriad I haven't got round to
putting in a delay loop so that I can actually read them! Is this the
behaviour under etherboot?


Corrado, cool though your boot loader undoubtedly is, is it worth your while
to put in partition support et al, when GRUB already does this? GRUB is
widely known and used by VSTa and the GNU Hurd (at least), so it's well
supported and tested and isn't going to go away. Also, one of the goals of
GRUB / multiboot was to avoid the proliferation of OS specific boot loaders.
Perhaps JOS has a better use for your technical skills? Classpath
integration, device drivers, more sophisticated gc, and investigations of
virtual memory, native threading, support for processes etc etc all spring
to mind.. 

Of course, boot loaders might be your thing .. if so, please ignore my
mumblings and carry right along!

Regards

-- George

Hi all,
I've spent my weekend to write a boot loader able to load and run JOS from
an hard disk. My program is composed of a pre-boot (installed on
the master boot record of HD) and a loader which loads a JOS image written
on HD starting from cyl=1,hd=0,sect=1. The loader is based on etherboot
code and, till now, it ignores any disk partition. Soon, I'll patch my
loader in order to make it able to boot from an HD partition rather than
the master boot record. Using this loader I was able to start JOS with
Bochs Pentium Emulator... it seems to work, however, it was necessary to
make some patches:
1. when JOS boots, it switches to VGA mode 7 (monocrome mode). It seems
that Bochs does not like this.. I mean.. does not handle monocrome video.
Thus I've patched &quot;head.s86&quot; and &quot;jjconsol.cc&quot; in order to startup with
VGA mode 3 (80x25 color) and make character writings to 0xb8000 rather
than 0xb0000. I've also added a software cursor to jjconsol.cc.
2. in order to make JOS able to work with Bochs, the latter must have the
FPU support, so download the FPU emulator and recompile Bochs (see Bochs
home page).
3. at JOS boot, the jbHeap class calls scrubMemory() which clear the
ENTIRE extended memory. This process is too long for Bochs, thus I've
removed this call.
4. if JOS is compiled without the option -DNATIVE_CLOCK, when JOS boots
(only under Bochs), it display continuosly &quot;notifyOfInterrupt(3):VM
corrupted. abort notify...&quot;. Anyone knows what's happen ? I think
interrupt handling needs a lot of patches.
5. The entire pre-boot/JOS load/JOS boot/start &quot;init&quot; process is VERY SLOW
with Bochs. It takes several minutes on a Pentium 133. However, tomorrow
I'll try a Pentium II/400.

... ok, it seems to be enough...

However, please let me know if you are interested in obtaining the JOS HD
boot loader. If yes, I'll prepare a tar.gz version which I'll post on my
web site so you can download it.

Bye, bye,
	Corrado
