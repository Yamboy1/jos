<PRE>&gt;<i> First of all, is there anyone that is currently working on this issue ?
</I>
	I had considered it while writing the console/consoled classes.
If console is implemented in such a fashion that it can be passed around
as a stream, everything just happens right.  The shell (or init, etc) sets
up the necessary redirections to make System.in/out/err work.  If an
application wants to use the console, they can use reflection to
find out if System.in/out/err is actually a console.

	You noted, quite correctly, that System isn't set up properly for
JOS.  One solution is to re-write System, but that will involve a lot of
behind-the-scenes dirty work.  And other globally static classes that
shouldn't be will need to be re-written, and we've forked classpath.  And
if an application makes use of a global static, we can't run multiple
copies of it.  Considering this problem early on, I came to the
conclusion that the Right Way to do this is to implement disjoint
classloaders, and allow programs a unified way of accessing them.
Originally, I came up with this approach as a way of ensuring
multi-java-process isolation in a single-process JVM.  (If your statics
are different, and you're not passed in any objects, since you can't
manipulate pointers, you can't run over anything else in ram.)  However,
it has the added benefit of allowing us to rampantly replace static
classes, like System, that are normally considered globals, with local
static copies, as suitably adjusted to make the process run.  (Although
I'll admit we'll need to trap System.exit(), etc, at some level those
calls must become native, and we can trap them and just nuke that process,
instead.)

	Disjoint classloaders are not present in JOS as it stands.  Adding
the nativecode support for the least-efficient implementation (totally
disjoint sets) should be relatively simple: allow a
(native/primordial) classloader to be created without inheriting any
classes.  Pass it the class (and arguments, for IPC) you want it to run,
and off you go.  Some standard facility for this process --
jos.system.system.fork()? -- should be provided to take care of the
details; you'd also need some way of getting static classes out of the
classloader so that they can be properly adjusted.  (eg:
	jls = forkClassLoader.getClass( &quot;java.lang.System&quot; );
        jls.setOut( shellRedirect );
	jls.setIn( shellRedirect );
	jls.setErr( shellRedirect );)

	More complicated schemes (trees of classloaders, starting from the
empty primordial) could be implemented behind the fork() (and/or whatever)
interface I've so loosely sketched out above, and decrease memory usage
and increase speed.  Security measures based on a denial of access to
static classes like jos.system.machine could implemented at the native
level or with a Java classloader.  (Also something, AFAIK, that doesn't
work now, and we'll need classpath support to do.)

	I'm hope that was clear; if not, let me know, and I'll try it
again. :)
