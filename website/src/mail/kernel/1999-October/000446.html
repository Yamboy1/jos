<PRE>Hi Todd and all

great I'll take a look at it.

</I>
Is it possible to dispatch/register more than one interrupt?

The fdc-driver (not event based) has 2 lines in &quot;handleInterrupt&quot; I hope
that is not time critical. Or does this driver has to be event based too?
 
&gt;<i> 	My model, in general, is that jos.platform.* is limited to

</I>&gt;<i> (even if they aren't there).  jos.platform.keyboard generates Key and
</I>&gt;<i> Scancode events, but jos.platform.driver.keyboard (&amp; keyboardd) is what
</I>&gt;<i> handles the hardware (lower-edge) part of the driver.  The
</I>&gt;<i> platform.drivers are expected to use jos.system.* (probably should be
</I>&gt;<i> renamed) to access the h/w, via the interrupts and machine classes, and
</I>&gt;<i> more as we need them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Thus jos.platform.screen would be driven by
</I>&gt;<i> jos.platform.driver.screen, which would just be Thomas Bocek's VGA driver
</I>&gt;<i> class (or a wrapper there-to).  jos.platform.driver.* will be copied over
</I>&gt;<i> from arch/bytecode/jos/platform/driver/* according the current build, so
</I>&gt;<i> that's how we get h/w-specificity.
</I>[cut]

some more questions:

The &quot;jos.platform.driver.screen&quot; function is hooked into
classpath ,probably with the reflection-class, and will decide which
driver to load (Vga,Matrox or whatever) and there will also be  
jos.platform.driver.networt, jos.platform.driver.hd,....
