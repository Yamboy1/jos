<PRE>&gt;<i> 4. if JOS is compiled without the option -DNATIVE_CLOCK, when JOS boots
</I>&gt;<i> (only under Bochs), it display continuosly &quot;notifyOfInterrupt(3):VM
</I>&gt;<i> corrupted. abort notify...&quot;. Anyone knows what's happen ? I think
</I>&gt;<i> interrupt handling needs a lot of patches.
</I>
	Yup.  It means that something is Terribly Wrong, in this
particular case, that the 8th index into the field table of the interrupt
class (which is usually jos.system.interrupts) is null, i.e.
uninitialized.  This is usually means that the static initializers haven't
been run yet.  You should (eventually) get to where that static
initializer is run; remember that the clock interrupt fires ALOT.  That's
the reason for the NATIVE_CLOCK flag: to allow the native code to directly
handle the clock, which is MUCH more efficient.
	The reasoning is that the clock interrupt mostly concerns the
scheduler; all the java-language device drivers could be written in terms
of abstract timers implemented by the scheduler instead of clock
interrupt handlers.  (But the timers and their interface don't exist yet,
so some drivers use the clock -- like the fd driver currently under
construction.)  Hopes this clears things up for you.

&gt;<i> However, please let me know if you are interested in obtaining the JOS HD
</I>&gt;<i> boot loader. If yes, I'll prepare a tar.gz version which I'll post on my
</I>&gt;<i> web site so you can download it.
</I>
	Is there a particular reason the boot loader needs to run JOS in
the emulator?
