<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; However, please let me know if you are interested in obtaining the JOS HD
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; boot loader. If yes, I'll prepare a tar.gz version which I'll post on my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; web site so you can download it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Is there a particular reason the boot loader needs to run JOS in
</I>&gt;<i> the emulator?
</I>
It will allow building and testing by people without 2 computers and 
ethernet (aka etherboot).

I think it would be excellent if you could put the package together.  
It would seem to me that there are two ways to bundle it and, if you 
have the time and inclination, both would be great.  

The first as a developer &quot;bundle&quot; including the sources (if any) you 
needed in order to get the &quot;base&quot; versions of either jos or bochs to 
work.  Do we have a clear abstraction of a booter ala JavaOS or 
would checking a second booter into CVS cause conflicts?

The second as a pure binary for those that just want to get the 
base running.  This second dist won't be super useful right now, but 
as soon as we get a classloader ready (do we have a classloader 
ready?) people can use the system to mess with adding class 
library support without actually hacking the kernel.  It is also a 
good first look at a possible system demo.
