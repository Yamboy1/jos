Hi there,

Although I don't know of any projects off the top of my head in this 
area for JOS it certainly is something that would be interesting to 
explore.  If you're interested, throw some ideas up in our WikiWeb 
and ask for feedback on the mailing lists.  Perhaps you can startup 
a working group on the subject!
