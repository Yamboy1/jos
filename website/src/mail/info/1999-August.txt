Subject: [JOS-Info] Wiki temporarily relocated

Hello all,

The JOSWiki has been down for the past two weeks and due to a variety
of reasons (most related to my being out of town on vacation) it has
not been fixed.  Basically the wiki needs to be relocated to another
server.  My first attempts to move it to Clark's machine have not
worked.  I have therefore, temporarily relocated it to my server:

http://www.metamech.com/wiki

This is a highly temporary relocation until I can get it on Clark's
machine so don't bookmark pages or do anything that would get the bots
and search engines banging on the site.  I've taken this "emergency"
measure since I won't have time to work on this for another week at
least and we have gone far too long without the wiki.  Please check the
main jos web page

http://www.jos.org

for announcements regarding future relocation of the site.  Comments
and questions should be sent to me or the admin list.  

DO NOT continue this thread on the general or info lists!!! All
followups should go to the admin list or directly to me.
