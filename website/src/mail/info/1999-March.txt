Subject: [JOS-Info] New Working Mail Lists...

Hello!

We have completed the migration of the working 
mailing lists from spin.de to jos.org  Web
access to these lists is at: 

	http://jos.org/mailman/listinfo

The jos-kernel and java-os-project list members
were automagically moved over to the new 
list server.  Anyway, here are the new lists:

List       | Purpose                 | Old List
-----------+-------------------------+----------
info       | Public Relations        |
admin      | Site Administration     |
vote-info  | Voting Membership List  |
 - - - - - + - - - - - - - - - - - - + - - - - - 
general    | Discussion List         | java-os-project
kernel     | Kernel Developers       | jos-kernel
arch       | Architectural Discourse | jos-network, jos-distributed, jos-security
apps       | Applications            | jos-apps
games      | Games!                  | jos-games
ui         | User Interface          | jos-ui
------------------------------------------------

The announce list will remain on spin.de into
the future (until mailman@list.org can handle a 
list with 4000+ members )

Best,

ClarkEvans
