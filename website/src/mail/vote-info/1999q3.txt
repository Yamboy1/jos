Subject: [JOS-Vote-Info] Constitution and Vote-Info URLS have changed

All,

Due to the wiki outage, the URLs for the Constitution and Policy Book that
we are voting on are no longer accessible.  Therefore, I have taken the
liberty of copying them to the following URL's, where they will eventually
need to be anyways.

http://www.jos.org/constitution.html
http://www.jos.org/policybook.html

These contain the exact text of the revisions of the documents mentioned in
the Call For Votes.  Please use these in deciding your vote.

Thanks,
Avery J. Regier

Vote Results

   * 13 Votes placed
   * 46 possible Voters
   * 12 vote quorum ("extraordinary" vote (25%))
   * 12 Yes vote(s) (Passes if yes >= 66%)
   *  1 Abstain vote(s)
   *  0 No vote(s)

There were a total of 13 Votes placed during the voting period out of a
total of 46 voters subscribed to vote-info on August 2, 1999.  The 46
voter total required an ("extraordinary" vote) quorum of 12 votes
(25%).  This was met by the 13 total votes.  Of the 13 votes, 12 were
"Yes", 1 was "Abstain".  This created a greater than 66% Yes vote to
pass the Constitution.

My apologies for the late report.  Any questions regarding the vote
itself should be sent directly to me, iainshigeoka@yahoo.com.  Any
discussions regarding this result should be made to the appropriate
mailing list (do not reply to all three lists in this crosspost).
