<H4>Introduction</H4>
Why would anyone develop a new operating system? Aren't there too many operating systems already? Different people have different reasons. Here are some of the reasons a Java-based operating system should not be developed:
<UL> <LI> system programming
<LI> <nolink>JavaOS was a failure
<LI> Linux is good enough
<LI> Microsoft Windows is good enough
</UL> <H4>System programming</H4>
Operating system software is the most difficult software to write. It is most difficult even when using a programming language specifically designed and tailored to it, such as C/C++. It is difficult, if not impossible, to write an operating system with a programming language designed for something else.
</P><P>
Likely, the Java programming language was never intended for use in system programming. A standard Java compiler does not include support for mechanisms often needed in system programming, such as conditional compilation. A standard Java class library does not include necessary methods for read-only memory, direct memory access, port I/O, implementing interrupt service routines, invoking a software interrupt, and more.
</P><P>
Likely, a Java Virtual Machine was never intended to keep track of resources based on a bytecode process. Even Java Native Interface (JNI) does not explain how multiple virtual machines within a machine code process might be resource-independent. While all of the necessary components are in place, it seems that no virtual machine designer has been compelled to use them.
</P><P>
All of these system programming issues must be addressed before anyone can build a Java-based operating system.
<H4>JavaOS was a failure</H4>
Some might say that, obviously, the market does not want a Java-based operating system. If they did, <a href="/view.php?topic=JavaOS&PHPSESSID=59fbc25e459493f3aa431ad6d458cb90">JavaOS</a><wikitopic JavaOS /wikitopic> would be a huge success, wouldn't it?
</P><P>
In fact, a product cannot reliably predict the market of an entire software catagory. The apparent failure of <nolink>JavaOS product does not imply that all Java-based operating systems are doomed. A market rarely wants a technology just for the sake of technology. If a Java-based operating system were successful, it would be because of whatever it does for the consumer that no other operating system can do.
</P><P>
Some might say that, if professional teams at Sun Microsystems and <a href="/view.php?topic=IBM&web=Main&PHPSESSID=59fbc25e459493f3aa431ad6d458cb90">IBM</a> <wikitopic IBM /wikitopic>couldn't make it work, how can a rag-tag group of volunteers do it?
</P><P>
In fact, <nolink>JavaOS failed for two reasons. First, its designers went too far in making it different. They failed to use perfectly good mechanisms from other operating systems that developers could find familiar. Second, Sun Microsystems undermined the release of <nolink>JavaOS. Both customers and potential customers of <nolink>JavaOS were surprised by this. A new, incompatible version of Java was developed with almost total disregard for a Java-based operating system and backward compatibility.
<H4>Linux is good enough</H4>
Linux works today. A Java-based operating system may be years away.
</P><P>
Linux is well-known, well-supported, and runs all of our favorite applications. It already runs platform-independent Java applications.  Linux is more popular than a Java-based operating system; many people are committed to improving Linux. The next version of Linux will be better than any Java-based operating system could ever be.
</P><P>
Why would anyone use a Java-based operating system when they can use Linux? Most of the benefits of free license and open source software can be achieved on Linux.
</P><P>
Unlike Java technologies from Sun Microsystems, Linux is an implementation of POSIX, an international standard. Sun Microsystems changes their "standard" from month to month with total disregard for how it affects third-part virtual machine designers and operating system development.
</P><P>
Some might say that Java applications are like poor cousins to native Linux software. While Linux software is fast, Java applications are slow. While its software uses X directly, Java applications are burdened by Swing on top of <a href="/view.php?topic=AWT&web=Main&PHPSESSID=59fbc25e459493f3aa431ad6d458cb90">AWT</a> <wikitopic AWT /wikitopic>on top of X.
</P><P>
In fact, Linux is very efficient. With the introduction of IBM's JDK, the difference between Linux applications and Java applications is small. If that's not fast enough, hybrid applications mix and match bytecode and machine code components. Time-critical components are written in machine code and used within a Java application.
<H4>Microsoft Windows is good enough</H4>
The introduction of Linux already woke up commercial operating system companies, such as Microsoft. Some might say that we do not need another operating system to restart healthy competition.
</P><P>
In fact, both Linux and Windows suffer from the same thing. Arrogantly, they implement all of their utilities in a different way. A new approach implements most, if not all, utilities in a platform-independent way.
</P><P>
Microsoft Office runs on Windows. It will never be ported to Java; it will never run on a Java-based operating system.
</P><P>
Microsoft Windows is well-known, well-supported, and runs all of our favorite applications. It already runs platform-independent Java applications. Microsoft promises to innovate. The next version of Windows will be better than any Java-based operating system ever could be.
</P><P>
Some may say that Java applications are like poor cousins to Windows software. While Windows software is fast, Java applications are slow. While its software uses Windows directly, Java applications are burdened by Swing on top of <nolink>AWT on top of Windows.
</P><P>
In fact, time-to-market is an important aspect of custom software. Even Java applications targetted only for Windows generally take less time to develop than with Visual Basic. The Java programming language is consistent, crisp and kludgeless. Its object-oriented features were not grafted onto the language as an afterthought, as happened to Visual Basic. Its standard library includes network and Internet/intranet components.
<H4>Summary</H4>
There might be good reasons not to develop a Java-based operating system. There may be good reasons to use some other programming language for system programming. There may be good reasons to use a foreign operating system, especially one with an available Java Virtual Machine. A purely Java-based operating system may not be right for everyone.<BR><BR></P><!--
