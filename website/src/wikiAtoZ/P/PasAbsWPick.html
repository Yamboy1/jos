</P><P>
</P><P>
<P>4.1 At certain times it may be desirable for a vote to be called amongst
members to make decisions on important issues.
</P><P>
<P>4.2 Voting issues shall be classified as "ordinary" and "extraordinary".
"Extraordinary" votes shall be reserved for changes to the Constitution.
All other issues shall be decided by "ordinary" votes.
</P><P>
<P>4.3 A vote may be called by any voting member. If a voting member
wishes to call a vote then this shall be advertised for a minimum number
of  days prior to the start of the vote in the manner described in the
policy book. The minimum number of days shall be 7 for "ordinary" votes
and 14 for "extraordinary" votes. The advertisement shall specify one
member who has agreed to second the vote and a member who has agreed
to act as a neutral administrator of the vote. The advertisement shall
also specify the proposed wording of the question to be asked in the vote.
</P><P>
<P>4.4 As a result of a vote advertisement any member may object to the
choice of a vote administrator at any time before the start of the vote.
An objection should be made by contacting the proposer of the vote and
informing them of the objection. In the event of an objection the vote
proposer can either withdraw the vote, or select a new administrator. In
the latter case, the proposer shall place a new vote advertisement in
accordance with paragraph 4.3 In addition, the proposer of a vote may
withdraw his proposal without prejudice at any time prior to the beginning
of vote tabulation by the administrator. Once vote tabulation has begun,
no withdrawal request shall be entertained, and any vote result shall be
considered valid and binding, subject to the satisfaction of all other
voting criteria.
</P><P>
<P>4.5 It should be deemed a contravention of this constitution if any
member abuses paragraph 4.4 with the intention of preventing a vote from
taking place.
</P><P>
<P>4.6 Voting shall take place over a minimum period . This period
shall be 10 days for "ordinary" votes and 20 days for "extraordinary" votes.
Each member has a single vote, although it is permissible for a member
to change their minds about a vote within the voting period. Changes in
votes shall be corroborated by the vote adminstrator in the manner prescribed
in the policy book.
</P><P>
<P>4.7 Voting shall be secret. At no time during the voting period shall
preliminary results be advertised. The voting procedure is detailed in
the policy book.
</P><P>
<P>4.8 It is the responsibility of the vote administrator to make a reasonable
attempt to advertise the results of the vote to the "JOS" membership within
3 days of the closure of the vote. Details of what is termed "reasonable"
are available within policy book. No vote shall be binding until the results
are successfully advertised.
</P><P>
<P>4.9 A vote is declared void if less than a quorum is reached. The
quorum shall be calculated as a percent of the number of members of the
voting information list. The quorum shall be 15% for "ordinary" votes and
25% for "extraordinary" votes. The procedure for tabulating the voting
information list membership and resulting quorums shall be detailed in
the policy book.
</P><P>
<P>4.10 Votes shall be classified into "atomic" issues and "pick list"
issues.
</P><P>
<P>4.11 An "atomic" issue shall be that which can be decided by votes
cast as one of the following: [a] Yes (approve the proposal as stated)
[b] No (disapprove the proposal as stated) [c] Neither (neither approve
or disapprove the proposal as stated)
</P><P>
<P>4.12 A "pick list" issue shall be that which requires selection of
a choice from a list of proposed options, for example, choice of a name
for "JOS*", or election of officers, and shall be decided by votes cast
as one of the following: [a] Approve a specific proposed option [b] Neither
(none of the proposed options is satisfactory) A "pick list" vote shall
never be conducted on a proposal to change the constitution.
</P><P>
<P>4.13  An "atomic" proposal is considered to have been approved
if the appropriate quorum was met and more than a minimum percent of votes
cast were "yes" votes. An "atomic" proposal is said to have been rejected
if the appropriate quorum was met and more than a minimum percent of votes
cast were "no" votes. An "atomic" proposal is considered to have failed
to pass without prejudice if neither "yes" nor "no" options reached the
minimum percent of votes cast or if the appropriate quorum was not met.
The minimum percent of votes cast for approval or rejection shall be 50%
for "ordinary" votes and 66% for "extraordinary" votes.
</P><P>
<P>4.14 A "pick list" item is considered to have been approved if the
appropriate quorum was met, more than a minimum percent of votes cast selected
some item, and one item received more votes than any other item. No "pick
list" proposal is considered to have been approved if the appropriate quorum
was not met, or if "neither" and "abstain" votes combined equaled a minimum
percent of votes cast, or if no single item received more votes than any
other item. The minimum percent of votes cast selecting some item shall
be 66%. If this minimum is met but more than one item received the maximum
number of votes, the vote shall be reformulated by the vote administrator
as a "pick list" vote containing only the items that received the maiximum
number of votes. The advertisement period for this subsequent vote shall
be reduced to 3 days.
