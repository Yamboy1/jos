<H4>Introduction</H4>
<EM>Persistence has been plagued by persistent problems of its own.</EM>
</P><P>
A <EM>barrier</EM> is an obstruction that's impossible to work around. While a general obstruction slows you down, a barrier stops you. While an obstruction is an irritation, a barrier is impassable. Like anything that gets in your way, a barrier prevents you from going where you want to go or doing what you want to do.
</P><P>
A <EM>persistence barrier</EM> is the un-breakable wall between dynamically running programs and dormant static data. Persistence in software is the notion that something can live on, past the end of a program.
</P><P>
What is the persistence barrier? And, why is it so important? This article reminds us of when the barrier was invented and why it remains an important part of modern computing.
<H4>Independent Process</H4>
In the beginning, computer processors were limited to running only one program at a time on their own dedicated console. The persistence barrier was limited to communication between independent computing devices. It was limited to inter-device communication. It was part of peripheral programming, like attaching a printer to a host. It was part of modem programming, like the communications libraries made popular by bulletin board system (BBS). It was part of network programming, attaching one host to another and running hosts with services across a network. Where there are two independent computing devices, there is a persistence barrier between them.
</P><P>
Life was simpler then. It was easier on the operating system, too. The operating system only needed to load and run one program at a time.
</P><P>
And then, a <EM>process</EM> was invented. An expensive computer could be divided into logically independent processes, enabling it to run more than one program at a time. Programmers worked long and hard to make sure processes were as independent as possible. Virtual devices were created. Hardware devices were limited resources and only available to one device driver at a time. Where there are two independent processes, there is a persistence barrier between them.
<H4>So many protocols</H4>
How many protocols are there? How many will there be? There are hundreds of thousands of protocols already invented. There are thousands of protocols already published. There is a special purpose protocol for every thing imaginable. There are a hundred more protocols invented every day. Even with the increased attention of the Internet, the rate of invention hasn't slowed down. There's no end in sight.
</P><P>
A <EM>protocol</EM> is a mechanism to get around the persistence barrier. The protocol provides a way to move objects from one computing device to another or from one process to another.
</P><P>
If all protocols are trying to overcome the same barrier, why are there so many protocols? The persistence barrier is real. It is a wall. It is a road block. It is more than a simple irritation. Many programmers have tried to break the persistence barrier and failed.
<H4>So many programmers</H4>
Some programmers aren't aware of the barrier. They go about their work finding ways to ignore it. They mistakenly believe it will go away by itself. They use ad hoc socket programming to coerce data across the persisence barrier.
</P><P>
Some programmers mistakenly believe the persistence barrier was broken long ago. They go about their work thinking the problem was solved. They point to their network <nolink>API ( <a href="/view.php?topic=NetworkAPI&PHPSESSID=34ea2c9bfe4027186d6e7a17c5e6586d">NetworkAPI</a><wikitopic NetworkAPI /wikitopic> ) or <nolink>SQL service ( <a href="/view.php?topic=SQLService&PHPSESSID=34ea2c9bfe4027186d6e7a17c5e6586d">SQLService</a><wikitopic SQLService /wikitopic> ) as if the struggle were over. If the persistence problem was truely solved, we would see the end. There would be no new protocols.
</P><P>
Some programmers believe the problem is solved if we keep up the fantasy that everything is one big machine. The network <EM>is</EM> the computer, right? A good example of this approach is clustering technology, where 16 or 64 independent processor can act as one. Clustering is an old idea. Lots of bright people have been struggling for years to get it to work. It has proven to be fragile. This makes it difficult for programmers to write high quality software, which must be robust, rugged and dependable. We have a long way to go before all the processing power of the Internet becomes one giant cluster.
</P><P>
Some believe in the myth of virtual RAM. If only everything were virtual RAM, we would have no need for any other kind of persistence, and thus, no persistence barrier. A good example of this is OS/400. While virtual <a href="/view.php?topic=RAM&web=Main&PHPSESSID=34ea2c9bfe4027186d6e7a17c5e6586d">RAM</a> <wikitopic RAM /wikitopic>helps many processes running on one machine, even if a machine is a cluster, it doesn't help transient inter-machine communication.
</P><P>
I am not a fan of Java serialization, either. This makes persistence obtuse and more difficult for programmers to write high quality software, with stability and compatibility.
<H4>Same old problems</H4>
These problems have plagued the software industry for decades. Our nagging problems with persistence must be taken more seriously. This problem is far more than an obstacle; it is a barrier. It needs to be thoroughly researched, well defined and understood. Only then will we break the persistence barrier once and for all time.
</P><P>
Now that Java puts distributed and network programming in easy reach, more programmers are going to hit this barrier. More programmers than ever before are going to be adversely affected by this barrier. And I'm worried, as so few programmers are prepared for it.<BR><BR></P><!--
