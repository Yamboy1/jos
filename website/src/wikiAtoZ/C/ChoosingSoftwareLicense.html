<H4>Introduction</H4>
This project can better help its members choose an appropriate software license, <EM>and should</EM>. How does someone make a decision about a license? What are the implications of choosing the wrong license? What is the difference between free license and open source? Here are some of the things I think about when choosing a license for a project.
<H4>One project at a time</H4>
I make a great effort to choose an appropriate license on a project-by-project basis. I try not to choose a license because it was appropriate for some other project. Different projects have different licensing needs.
</P><P>
It is most appropriate for a in-house corporate project to choose a proprietary, closed license. Custom software can be great competitive advantage. An in-house project typically builds software that is so customized that few others can benefit directly from the source code. It is annoying for others for someone to open this kind of code.
* Of course, there are exceptions to this rule. Certain case studies explain how a corporate project succeeded in building custom software and should include examples of actual production quality source code.
</P><P>
If you think your software is directly reusable by other programmers, it might be a good candidate for free license. A free license enables other programmers to use your software as a subsystem or plug-in. Making the license free will potentially benefit the most people.
</P><P>
If you think other programmers can improve their skills by immitating what you have done, your software might be a good candidate for open source. Unlike free license, open source enables other programmers to learn from your experience. Other programmers write their own code. A license is provided with open source to determine how much of your code can be used directly.
<H4>Why license?</H4>
It is not necessary to create a license for all of your code. One way to manage your code is as a <STRONG>trade secret</STRONG>. If you are the only person to read, use or distribute your code, license is irrelevant. Trade secret is a favored mechanism among software developers. Many corporations build software this way.
</P><P>
If others read, use or distribute your code, a software license may help you protect your interests. You might choose to negotiate a <STRONG>unique license</STRONG> between yourself and each customer. This license might negotiate an appropriate fee. This is a popular choice because you can negotiate both the terms and the limitations based on your relationship with a customer. A free license does not necessarily limit your ability to negotiate a unique software license between yourself and a customer. An additional license might explain terms and conditions of support and proprietary extensions.
</P><P>
You might choose to offer a <STRONG>blanket license</STRONG> for all your customers together. This kind of license is popular for both free and commercial software. This is a popular choice because, for some software, it is both time-consuming and expensive to negotate one customer at a time. It is time-consuming because each point of a license is negotiable. It might be expensive because, with too many licenses, it is easy to get confused about what was promised to whom. When you don't deliver as promised, your customers are disappointed.
<H4>Styles of license</H4>
It seems like there are as many licenses as there are software products. License can be catagorized based on how much they cost.
<UL> <LI> free license
<LI> for-fee license
</UL> A free license means that no fee is paid. The terms of the license are not contingent on a customer paying a fee for services rendered. A free license should not be confused with the more controversial issue of free software, such as re-defined by the Free Software Foundation.
</P><P>
A for-fee license means that a fee is paid. The terms of the license depend on money changing hands. A for-fee license should not be confused with the more controversial issue of proprietary, closed software as promoted by a few commercial software companies.
<H4>Pirating</H4>
Pirating is a crime. If you take something that does not belong to you, it's wrong. A few software companies have been misleading when it comes to pirating. They conveniently oversimplify their message. They mistakenly say, "If you take something without paying for it, it's wrong." This is simply not true. If someone gives you a gift, you take it without paying. It is not pirating. It's not wrong.
<H4>Gift software</H4>
Free license software is a gift. People have been generous with something they have written. They have given it to you as a gift.
<UL> <LI> Some people expect you to be generous, too. If they give you a gift, they expect you to give it to others as a gift.
<LI> Some do not expect you to be generous. If they give you a gift, they expect you to keep it to yourself.
<LI> Some expect you to return the favor. When they give you something, they give it conditionally. They expect you to give them something in return.
</UL> Different people have different expectations of you when they publish free license software. Their expectations are reflected in the software license. Do they expect you to keep it to yourself, give it to others, or give something to them in return? The answers will be spelled out in the software license. Read it carefully so that you can fulfill your part of the agreement.
<H4>Adopt a license</H4>
<UL> <LI> <a href="/view.php?topic=AdoptSoftwareLicense&PHPSESSID=77aa50f72b5b84907962b9fc4b615190">AdoptSoftwareLicense</a><wikitopic AdoptSoftwareLicense /wikitopic>
</UL> While you could write a new license for your software, you might choose to adopt a license. If you adopt an appropriate license, it can be less time-consuming and less expensive for you. It can be less time-consuming because the most difficult work has been done for you. It can be less expensive because you don't have to hire a software license expert. A lawyer has already expressed the terms of the license in legalese, the language of contracts.
</P><P>
Which license should you adopt? Adopting someone else's license is always a compromise. Read it carefully so that you can fulfill your part of the agreement and so that you know what to expect from your customers. While you need not enforce everything in the license, it determines what is possible to enforce.
<H4>Everyone</H4>
When you offer a free license to everyone, it means everyone. Authors sometimes forget that "everyone" includes commercial companies like IBM, Microsoft, <a href="/view.php?topic=RedHat&PHPSESSID=77aa50f72b5b84907962b9fc4b615190">RedHat</a><wikitopic RedHat /wikitopic> and Sun Microsystems.
</P><P>
If you enable others to freely distribute your software, you maximize the distribution of your software. More people have the potential to use your software. Not only an individual can distribute your software, but commercial companies like Slackware, <a href="/view.php?topic=RedHat&PHPSESSID=77aa50f72b5b84907962b9fc4b615190">RedHat</a><wikitopic RedHat /wikitopic>, <a href="/view.php?topic=SuSE&PHPSESSID=77aa50f72b5b84907962b9fc4b615190">SuSE</a><wikitopic SuSE /wikitopic> can.
</P><P>
There are plenty of ways to make money on software beyond software licensing. Many consultants and software companies have found more commercial success in the support of software than in software licensing. Customers find they typically get higher quality software through a support agreement than through a traditional end-user license agreement. If you want to limit yourself to making money from the licensing of software itself, choose a commercial software license.
<H4>Summary</H4>
Choosing a license is difficult. There are many implications. There are many issues. Your choice will have an impact on how many people can use your software. Your choise will have an impact on the quality of the software over time.
</P><P>
I have participated in a number of open source projects and many proprietary, closed source projects. I have heard the endless rant of some members of the Free Software Foundation. I have read Eric Raymonds book and website. Others have tried to persuade me to change the license for my software projects.
</P><P>
Try not to decide which the software license you'll need on years from now. Don't try to make it a monumental choice, a choice of a lifetime. Don't choose one software license for all time. Let the needs of a project determine your software license, one project at a time.
</P><P>
You should make an informed choice. Read more about it. Others cannot make the choice for you.<BR><BR></P><!--
