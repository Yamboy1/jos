Yep.  I'm in the same boat... should head home.
</P><P>
<HR>
More details...
</P><P>
Basically, the memory manager would then service the request and 
put/get the memory from the stack.  That's that.
</P><P>
There are a few items that need to be addressed:
<OL> <LI>  Not all classes can be supported by all managers
<LI>  Inter-manager object references.  
</OL> 
Hmmmm.....
</P><P>
<HR>
</P><P>
<i> Database=no file system? </i>  Well, from a users perspective, NO.  They have no clue how the information is stored (unlike, say Word).
</P><P>
<HR>
To detail how this <EM>might</EM> work for references:
</P><P>
Ok.  First of all, the VM reference says that object
references are 32 bits.  Fun.  I do not think that there is
a reason why we can't implement this differently as long as
we meet this illusion to the corrsponding bytecodes.
</P><P>
For the time being, let us limit our conversation to get/set
for fields of an object since this is 80% of the meat.
</P><P>
Lets say that our "Reference" data type is partitioned
into two parts.  The high word gives an address or offset
in a jump table for the interface of the memory manager 
being used to minipulate the object.  The low word is
can be used by the memory manager any way we see fit.
</P><P>
Although this is not the best solution, it is the most obvious.
This gives us 16 bits to define the memory managers (too much)
and 16 bits that the memory manager can use to identify an
object (too few).  We could play lots of games to make this
ratio a bit better, for instance we could use the first bit
to denote if we are using the "normal, volitale RAM" manager.  This would give us 31 bits of address space for that one manager, 15 bits for other managers, and 16 bits for the address space in that manager.  Alternatively, a double dispach can be used... but these are just (important) details....
<HR>
<b> Did you get what I was saying about the bytecodes?</b>
</P><P>
They are the interface to move information from the data
store (RAM,Disk,OODBMS,RDBMS,DistributedObject,etc) to 
the stack.
</P><P>
Make sence?  They are interface unified model. Processing:
</P><P>

<LI>   Processing (Implemented by the other bytecodes)
<LI>   Output (Set Bytecodes, Implemented by memory manager)
</OL> 
The Oracle memory manager, for instance, would be serving
up objects.. the objects would <EM>never</EM> actually exist

the pluggable opportunity.

</P><P>
Actually, most of the applcations I work with are database
applications.  So, yes, there is no file system.  Just one
big gigantic object space.  And it is a shit load of code
to make the illusion magical.  I just keep having to reinvent
this wheel again and again and again and again and frankly
I'm getting sick of operating systems that don't <a href="/view.php?topic=DoTheRightThing&PHPSESSID=a224e9a901cb4b126377b0df10b10ba5">DoTheRightThing</a><wikitopic DoTheRightThing /wikitopic>(tm).
Basically the user interface talks to the user in "their" 
terms.  When a word processing document is finished it says
"publish?" not "save?".  Save is stupid. Of course it is saved.
</P><P>
Oracle's object-relational support is mediocre.  The binding
is what is really poor and needs help.  Yep, actually in this

the same approach.... although majorly flawed.  It sits on
top of JDBC.  I need to spend more time to really evaluate it,
but so far I am not really that impressed.  I can imagine
it being painfullly slow and not handling all of the distribued
concerns that you need to be worried about (JDBC simply
hides most of them).  Anyway, a Oracle memory manager woudl

distribued transactions, etc the whole shebang!

I don't know, perhaps I am just being plain old weird here.
But why not?  Sure performance. Well, lets finish brain storming
it out, make a quick prototype and claim inneficient later?  Or
is this too much to ask.

Well... the Java byte codes __are__ the model.

Sure you can say that it is an ideal, and some of 
the later things are a bit on the, well, shall we say,
heated list?  I have read Sun's papers on making distribued

I think they are being overly pessimistic.

Anyway, persistent storage <EM>is</EM> about ignoring the 
difference between ram and disk and leaving it up

It would be nice if we could make our memory management

find a practical way to do this effectively...

Well, sure desktop vs process.  I need to think more on this
one.  However, what is a "service" in Windows?  It is a
program that is always running in the background - infact
some services do their best to carry on as they left off.
</P><P>
There is another big problem with saving processes, that
is transient variables.... this might make things unworkable.
</P><P>
But actually, saving process is only about 5% or less of what
I am really after....
</P><P>

1.  I agree here.  We <EM>could</EM> use serilization to save classes.
I see this as a policy of a memory manager.  :) Agree here

2.  Nope, nothing dictates, infact even though they say that
references are 32 bits, nothing saying we can use something else as long as the VM works as expected.  :) Agree here

methods on existing class files.  Basically they modify the class
files and do swizzling without help of the VM.  It is a <EM>really</EM> nasty way to do it and it is not very transparent.. they use proxy objects everwhere.  (The pre compiler generates a class with the identical interface that does a residency check and then delegates)

4. I am no expert here either.  Just interested.  I have alot of Oracle background and a math degree so it is not so rough.  Simple stuff they have going.

5.  Hmm.  Don't get this point.  Let me try to explain the Memory Manager.

Yes.  Processes __can__ be persisted.	This saves the users
desktop right were they left off, etc.  It brings up a host of problems, like locks.  I guess your point is somewhat valid, what <EM>good</EM> is it.  Hmm.  Well it would leave the user right where they

Well, I think that process can be persisted.  If you read the grasshopper stuff they are doing it, PJama will do this in the future as well....  There is nothing saying that during the "stabiliation" process the stack is saved, etc....  We can pull really nice tricks to pull this off beacuse we are writing our own VM.
</P><P>
<HR>
  1. A persistence mechanism exists in Java: Serializable, etc.
</P><P>
Yes it does, but it is an all or nothing kind of thing.  You have to stream the object and all of its references in one big file.  This does not scale to a corporate order entry system.
</P><P>
  2. This mechanism relies on streams.
</P><P>
Yep. It is also slow beacuse the "saved" format is different from teh internal format.  Read about Grasshopper and PJama.... they are doing what is called <a href="/view.php?topic=OthogonalPersistence&PHPSESSID=a224e9a901cb4b126377b0df10b10ba5">OthogonalPersistence</a><wikitopic OthogonalPersistence /wikitopic>
