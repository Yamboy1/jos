<H4>Introduction</H4>
I am no stranger to controversy. I have been a software critic since the beginning. On my first job as computer operator, everybody seemed to gravitate toward me and complain about poor quality software. The company's software didn't help them get their work done and they were powerless to fix it.
</P><P>
My fellow employees were overwhelmed. They couldn't deal with it. They didn't want to learn how to program. They were salespersons, accountants, managers, electrical engineers. They already had a career. They didn't want to learn all about computers, <EM>and shouldn't have to.</EM>
</P><P>
I was young and naive at the time, and so they asked me to figure it out. They asked me to intervene in their behalf. They asked me to talk to the programmers, explain a problem in a language programmers could understand, and beg them to fix it. I started working on software because it was so far removed from what people wanted. Yes, I learned to program because software was so, so wrong.
</P><P>
Experiment is what I do. What if the software doesn't work? How do we find out what it should do? How should it work? The only way to find out is to experiment.
</P><P>
Most, if not all, of the business applications I produced over the years have been experimental from my viewpoint. While most people use them, others refuse. While most people love them, some hate them. I learned a lot about the difference between high quality and poor quality software along the way.
<H4>Never finished</H4>
Software is never finished. If there could only one thing true about software, it would be that software is never finished. In spite of shipping it, in spite of using it, in spite of meeting a deadline, software is not really finished, <EM>and should never be.</EM>
</P><P>
Things change. Feelings, goals, priorities and customers change over time. These are the reasons why software is developed in the first place. These are the reasons why software has to be maintained constantly in order to keep on helping us get our work done.
</P><P>
I understand how we would like to see the end. I understand how customers would like to build software that doesn't need to be maintained. Are you still expecting finished software?
</P><P>
Get used to it. From the smallest program to the largest application suite, the software is never finished. When looking at the puzzle again, we can always find a new way of thinking about it. With a new model, we can find ways to make the software a little better. It is an endless cycle because we're intelligent enough to find ways of improving even the most refined model.
</P><P>
<EM>That's what turns programming into fun.</EM>
</P><P>
The individual and industry is continuously improving. The techniques are refined. The models are refined. The goal is simply to make better things. Some people misunderstand the purpose of reusable software. Reuse does not mean that software is written once for all time. Each time a programmer gets a new idea, the software is written again, <EM>and should be.</EM>
</P><P>
As roughly quoted from <EM>Cathedral and Bazzaar</EM>, release early and release often. How's this? Because the software isn't going to ever be finished anyway. Releasing early and often is a good way to get used to it.
<H4>No final draft</H4>
What impact does this have on developing an operating system? We must understand that there will never be a final draft. It isn't like book that's published only after a final draft is approved. A book is delayed, put off and pushed out because it would be very expensive to a print a rough draft. Yet, there may be a market for a second edition.
</P><P>
We should not tease people with the idea that everything in an operating system will be fully tested, production ready, all at once. Integration is not a final step; it should happen every day. A big bang integration at the end of the project doesn't work.
</P><P>
There is no need to set space aside for experimental packages. They are all experimental.
</P><P>
We should not label everything in an operating system as meeting a particular version. They all have their own versions of different things. How will we ever know what works well together? How will we know what has been tested together?
<H4>Reuse class names</H4>
<EM>John, you're in trouble now!</EM>
</P><P>
Just as it's all right to have more than one person named John, it is all right to have more than one class named Button. We must embrace the notion that class names are not going to be unique system-wide. Java supports a large name space and insists on unique class names within each package, not system-wide. Packages keep the class names unique.
<H4>Don't reuse package names</H4>
On the other hand, don't ever reuse a package name. Unlike reusing class names, reusing a package name is a very bad idea. Different releases of an application have different dependencies. What if you don't have the lastest version of everything? What happens when your customers can't keep up?
</P><P>
This seems to be the simplest way to publish Java programs over time. Each version of an application goes in its own package. It is possible to simultaneously develop different versions with different dependencies. One for Java 1.1.7; one for Java 2.0.x. One for Swing in javax; one for Swing in sun. One for Netscape Navigator. One for all JVMs; one that runs in <a href="/view.php?topic=JustJOS&PHPSESSID=51aca5e40edbccaeddb9bd05f61fccb9">JustJOS</a><wikitopic JustJOS /wikitopic>.

This has many benefits. None of the different versions get mixed up. And besides, you can build an application factory that gives you the application that works best with your environment.
<H4>Package names</H4>
Package names are plentiful. We must embrace the notion that package names should be used freely. An operating system is a very large object. It wastes time to plan on testing the entire first version of the operating system before starting on the second version. Who will be able to say that at a given moment in time, the first version is complete? Software is never finished. Embracing this notion, you use what's released; you improvise for anything else.
</P><P>
Java application development doesn't wait for anyone. Development doesn't stop just because we don't think <a href="/view.php?topic=JOS&web=Main&PHPSESSID=51aca5e40edbccaeddb9bd05f61fccb9">JOS</a> <wikitopic JOS /wikitopic>is finished. There's lots of work to do.
</P><P>
Our responsibility to others is let others know how much our package has been tested. Testing a package doesn't wait until it is finished. Each class is tested as it is written. If you are aware that a package has a defect, let others know it up front. Likewise, they will let you know when they find things.
</P><P>
Release each package with a new name. This is a polite way for other programmers and their customers to keep on using the software they wrote based on the old release.
</P><P>
Keep both the old and the new package. It helps all programmers going forward. Packages tend to get more complex over time. It is difficult to come up to speed on a package without knowing where it started.
</P><P>
Anyone using software should always be sceptical that it is going to work at all. Beginners write Java code. Amatures write Java code. Stressed-out, over-worked, sleepy professionals write Java code. The most experienced programmer is still human and capable of making mistakes.
</P><P>
How will we know when software has been tested?
<UL> <LI> Could it be when we run the test suites provided? No. The software might work only inside the suite.
<LI> Could it be when the programmer say so? No. The software might work only on the programmer's network.
<LI> Could it be when a popular magazine says so? No. A journalist is supposed to advise you about the pros and cons of buying into a new product or new release. Many popular magazines have eroded into telling you what the software company told them. They repeat the same marketing stuff that you can get from the vendor. It sounds good but adds no value.
<LI> Could it be when a very large commercial software company says so? <EM>Absolutely not.</EM> A giant software company might have more important things to do than write high quality software. They might spend an inordinate amount of time figuring out how to make more money. After promising to ship it only when it is finished, they might be under tremendous pressure to ship it anyway, since software is never finished.
<LI> Could it be when you try to get your work done and can? You only know the software has been tested if you try it yourself. You must make up your own mind.
</UL> What you and I may think of as experimental software, other people think of as production quality. And the other way around, too. What other people may think of as experimental software, you and I might think of as production quality.
</P><P>
It is only a helpful hint to label software as ready. Quality, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.<BR><BR></P><!--
