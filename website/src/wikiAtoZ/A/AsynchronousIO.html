<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>Without a foreign operating system and kernel to handle it, a virtual machine on <nolink>JOS must handle asynchronous I/O by itself. Asynchronous I/O enable a request to be broken into two parts. A client thread puts an I/O request into a queue. A separate thread handles the request as soon as it can. The I/O thread notifies the client thread when the response is ready.</P>
<P>Ansynchonous I/O enables a process to use peripherals with a wide variation in response time. A diskette drive might be "slower" then a hard drive. A modem might be "slower" than a diskette drive. A tape drive might be "slower" than a modem. When a thread reads from or writes to an I/O stream, the same mechanism is used regardless of the response time of a device.</P>
<H4>Example</H4>
<P>The classes found in the <CODE>jeps</CODE> package are a good example of how asynchronous I/O is done. <a href="/view.php?topic=JEPS&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=efcf5fae785b672038b0582b46958e55">JEPS</a> <wikitopic JEPS /wikitopic>should be used as a prototype for asynchronous I/O in general.</P>
<P>A network interface is a perfect example of an asynchronous I/O. Incoming packets must be expected at any time. A network driver does not poll the network interface for the next packet. A network interface uses an interrupt to pass an incoming packet to the driver. The interrupt service routine and network driver share an incoming packet queue.</P>
<P>This model should be extended, with requests, queues, and packets to manage the entire asynchronous I/O problem within our operating system.</P>
<H4>Prototype</H4>
<P>Just as <nolink>JEPS is a working prototype of the TCP/IP subsystem, a working prototype should be developed for the file subsystem. A prototype, for example, would be able to simulate a standard hardware delay. <CODE>AsynchronousFileInputStream</CODE> could read a foreign OS file using a separate I/O thread. <CODE>AsynchronousFileOutputStream</CODE> could write foreign OS file using a separate I/O thread. The I/O thread becomes the only thread capable of reading and writing files to the foreign OS. The I/O thread could simulate asynchronous I/O by waiting for a user-defined delay before processing an I/O request.</P>
<PRE>
public interface IORequest {
  public static final int UNQUEUED = 0;
  public static final int QUEUED = 1;
  public static final int PROCESSING = 2;
  public static final int SUCCESS = 3;
  // any status greater than SUCCESS = ERRORCODE

  public abstract int getStatus();
  public abstract void setStatus( int v );
  public abstract Callback getCallback();
  public abstract void setCallback( Callback v );
  public abstract IORequest getNext();
  public abstract void addRequest( IORequest v );
}
</PRE>
<H4>Request queue</H4>
<P>When a client thread wants to open a file, an <CODE>FILE_OPEN</CODE> request is added to the I/O request queue. When using a non-blocking call to open a file, the client thread is notified by the I/O thread when the file has been open'd (or the open request has failed).</P>
<P>When a client thread wants to read from an open file, an <CODE>FILE_READ</CODE> request is added to the I/O request queue. When using a non-blocking call to read a file, the client thread is notified by the I/O thread when bytes are available (or the read request has failed).</P>
<P>When a client thread wants to write to an open file, an <CODE>FILE_WRITE</CODE> request is added to the I/O request queue. When using a non-blocking call to write a file, the client thread is notified by the I/O thread when bytes are written and verified (or the write request has failed).</P>
<P>When a client thread wants to close a file, an <CODE>FILE_CLOSE</CODE> request is added to the I/O request queue. When using a non-blocking call to close a file, the client thread is notified by the I/O thread when the file has been close'd (or the close request has failed).</P>
<H4>Classes</H4>
<P>Each kinds of I/O request should be a different class (or interface).</P>
<PRE>
IORequest
 +--FileRequest
	  +-- FileOpenRequest
	  +-- FileReadRequest
	  +-- FileWriteRequest
	  +-- FileCloseRequest
</PRE>
<P>A basic I/O request should provide a <CODE>next</CODE> property for single-linked list chain. All I/O requests are processed in the order in which they are requested. It is a first-in/first-out (FIFO) queue.</P>
<PRE>
public class BasicIORequest
	 implements IORequest {
  :
  public void addRequest( IORequest v ) {
	 if ( next == null ) {
		next = v;
		return;
	 }
	 next.addRequest( v );
  }
  :
  private IORequest next;
  :
</PRE>
<P>The I/O thread reads the next request off the top of the I/O request queue. It processes the request. It updates the request, showing success or if failure, the reason for the failure. In our prototype, the I/O thread should be forced to wait for a few hundred milliseconds between each request.</P>
<P>Each kind of I/O request has different properties. While a file-open request might have a property for the name of a file to open, a file-read request probably has a payload property for the incoming data.</P>
<H4>Like <CODE>MediaTracker</CODE></H4>
<P>Asynchronous I/O is the reason for <CODE>java.awt.MediaTracker</CODE>. Anyone working with asynchronous I/O should review this class. Look at the way each request has an associated status.</P>
<H4>Non-blocking methods</H4>
<P>By introducing asynchronous I/O, we introduce non-blocking methods. Most methods in the Java class libraries are blocking methods. Non-blocking methods simply require an additional call-back parameter. The I/O thread must notify a client thread when a request has been processed (both successfully or not).</P>
<P>In a non-blocking version of a method, the client thread provides a call-back interface. The I/O thread uses the call-back interface to let the client thread know that it has processed a non-blocking request. Here is an example of a call-back interface:</P>
<PRE>
public interface Callback {
  public abstract void onCallback( IORequest v );
}
</PRE>
<P>After it has been processed, the <CODE>IORequest</CODE> is passed back to the client thread. A client thread can add more than one request to the I/O request queue at a time. As each request is processed the client thread is notified properly.</P>
<P>If a client thread does not want to be notified, it can pass null to the non-blocking method. The I/O thread processes the request and never notifies a client thread. Why is this important? When it kills a process, the operating system must close all of the open files owned by the process. To be more precise, the operating system must add a close-file request to the I/O request queue for every open file. But, when killing the process, there is nothing left to notify.</P>
<P>The I/O request queue is a powerful thing. A client thread can output lots of data to a file all at once:
<PRE>
  FileWrite( null, fd, data );
  FileWrite( null, fd, data );
  FileWrite( null, fd, data );
  FileClose( this, fd );
</PRE>
<P>When the length of a file is known, a client thread can input lots of data from a file all at once:</P>
<PRE>
  FileRead( null, fd );
  FileRead( null, fd );
  FileRead( null, fd );
  FileClose( this, fd );
</PRE>
<P>This mechanism guarantees that a client thread is notified in the order in which request are recieved. When reading data, a client thread keeps a vector of individual read requests. When notified that the close request has been processed, the client thread can examine the status codes for each request.</P>
<P>It is also possible for asynchronous device drivers to look ahead in the I/O request queue. Even though a device driver might fulfill a request ahead of time, the client thread is never notified out-of-order.</P>
<H4>Multiple instances</H4>
<P>A single thread manages all I/O requests. Requests are added to the I/O request queue from many other threads. Every thread must be able to find the I/O request queue. Every thread must be able to add I/O requests to the I/O request queue.</P>
<P>It is possible for all file requests to be routed to a file I/O request queue. When a request is routed, the client thread is not notified in production mode.</P>
<H4>Client property</H4>
<P>In order for the client request to be notified, an I/O request must have a callback property.</P>
<PRE>
public interface BasicIORequest {
  :
  public Callback getCallback() {
	 return callback;
  }
  public void setCallback( Callback v ) {
	 callback = v;
  }
  :
  private Callback callback;
  :
}
</PRE>
<H4>Life cycle of an I/O request</H4>
<UL>
<LI><P>When an I/O request is created, its status is UNQUEUED.</P>
<LI><P>When an I/O request is added to the I/O request queue, the subsystem updates its status to QUEUED.</P>
<LI><P>When it takes the next request off its queue, the I/O thread changes the status to <a href="/view.php?topic=PROCESSING&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=efcf5fae785b672038b0582b46958e55">PROCESSING</a> <wikitopic PROCESSING /wikitopic>and then goes about processing the request. While its processing, the I/O thread status is "busy". Other requests wait in a queue.</P>
<LI><P>When the I/O thread is finished with a request, it updates the request's status and invokes the <CODE>onCallback()</CODE> method to notify the client thread. A request is either a success or failure. When it is a success, the I/O thread sets the request's status to SUCCESS. When it is a failure, the I/O thread sets the request's status to any value greater than SUCCESS. Error codes are useful to explaining why the request was a failure. Each kind of request defines it own set of error codes.</P>
</UL>
<H4>About <CODE>IOBridge</CODE></H4>
<P>An alternative class library must use <CODE>IOBridge</CODE> for all its I/O. The <CODE>IOBridge</CODE> is one of those <a href="/view.php?topic=JVMSpecificClasses&PHPSESSID=efcf5fae785b672038b0582b46958e55">JVMSpecificClasses</a><wikitopic JVMSpecificClasses /wikitopic>. An I/O thread implementation of <CODE>IOBridge</CODE> would enable a standard Java application to run on top of asynchonous I/O. All of this runs inside an off-the-shelf virtual machine.</P>
<P>Nothing prevents an <CODE>IOBridge</CODE> from running additional threads. While it is not inherently runnable, the virtual machine can initialize the <CODE>IOBridge</CODE> by any mechanism. There are no limits to what a JVM-specific class can do.</P>
<P>Like the <CODE>IOBridge</CODE> for pseudos, two threads are used. Asynchronous I/O is reduced to a problem of multiple threads.</P><BR><BR></P><!--
