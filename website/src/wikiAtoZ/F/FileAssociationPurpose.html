<H4>Introduction</H4>
Universal resource identifiers (URI), <a href="/view.php?topic=MIME&web=Main&PHPSESSID=f8ddaf5ffd9f0a39d8dad9346c0a8c36">MIME</a> <wikitopic MIME /wikitopic>types and file associations are solutions to the same problem. Here is a step by step analysis of this problem.
<H4>Definition</H4>
An <EM>association</EM> is another word for relationship. An association is usuallys a loose relationship between two things.
</P><P>
A <EM>file association</EM> maintains a loose relationship between files and programs. On one hand, we have a file. A file contains inert, static and benign data. We have all kinds of files, such as binary, text, archives and custom.
</P><P>
On the other, we have programs. Unlike a file, a program has behavior and is active. (See footnote [1].) We have all kinds of programs, such as agents, applets, applications and servlets. All behavior comes from a program. Programs produce files.
</P><P>
What is the purpose of a file association? Let's take this one step at a time. You might be surprised by what you learn when you follow these steps.
<H4>Step 1. What is a "file"?</H4>
Generically speaking, a file is a collection of octets. An octet is a collection of eight bits. A file is a general purpose mechanism to store any digital payload. A file always has a unique identify. A file might or might not have a "name". The name of a file helps us (human beings) find it again.
<H4>Step 2. What is a file mechanism?</H4>
Any collection of octets can be manipulated by a classic "file mechanism". The file mechanism introduces a way to traverse a collection of octets by imagining a sequential order. Reading a file enables to traverse a collection of octets, starting with the first, until there are no more octets. Writing a file enables you to create a collection of octets, starting with the first, until you have no more octets to write. We imagine skipping "forward" and "backward" in a file as if it were contiguous when, in fact, it is rarely so.
<H4>Step 3. What are anonymous file primatives?</H4>
All files are the same. The next generation operating system should associate generic tools with all kinds files, such as create, copy, delete, move, print, backup, encrypt, decrypt, encode, decode, translate and transfer.
<UL> <LI> Any file can be created with an anonymous "create" primative. Any program can create any kind of file.
<LI> Any file can be opened and closed with an anonymous "open" and "close" primative. Any program can open any kind of file. A program can open a file created by other programs.
<LI> Any file can be duplicated with an anonymous "copy" primative. You can copy any file, created by any program, without the assistance of the application that created the file.
<LI> Any file can be deleted with an anonymous "delete" primative. You can delete any file, without the assistance of an application that created the file.
</UL> <H4>Step 4. What are anonymous file functions?</H4>
A <EM>function</EM> is like a primative, but more abstract. Primatives are combined and used to perform a function. An <EM>anonymous</EM> function does not require the original program that created a file.
<UL> <LI> Any file can be moved with an anonymous "move" function. The move primative is a combination of copy and delete primatives.
<LI> Any file can be backed up with an anonymous "backup" function. Any program can backup any kind of file. Backup is another form of "copy".
<LI> Any file can be <EM>restored</EM> with an anonymous "restore" function. Any program can restore any kind of file. Restore is another form of "copy".
<LI> Any file can be <EM>encoded</EM> (translated), compressed or encrypted with an anonymous "encoding" primative. This includes encode, decode, encrypt, decrypt, zip, unzip, tar, untar, jar and unjar. Encoding is another form of "copy".
<LI> Any file can be transfered with an anonymous "transfer" primative. A transfer copies a file from one digital device to another. This includes upload, download, copy, paste, BBS, UUCP, FTP, HTTP, SMB, NFS, <nolink>PCAnywhere and <nolink>LapLink. This includes all kind of distribution medium, such as diskette, Zip drive, CD-ROM, tape, network and fiber optics. Transfer is another form of "copy".
</UL> <H4>Step 5. What is possible?</H4>
We must understand the difference between what is possible and what is popular. It isn't popular to view a file in hexidecimal or interpret it to <a href="/view.php?topic=ASCII&web=Main&PHPSESSID=f8ddaf5ffd9f0a39d8dad9346c0a8c36">ASCII</a> <wikitopic ASCII /wikitopic>characters when printing. Since I use a hexidecimal viewer and view all kinds of files with it, I know that it is possible.
</P><P>
Octets, like those stored in any file, can be viewed with a generic viewer. A hexidecimal viewer shows octets in hexidecimal format. A decimal viewer shows octets in decimal format. A text viewer displays octets in <nolink>ASCII or <a href="/view.php?topic=EBCDIC&web=Main&PHPSESSID=f8ddaf5ffd9f0a39d8dad9346c0a8c36">EBCDIC</a> <wikitopic EBCDIC /wikitopic>symbols. An <nolink>ASCII or <a href="/view.php?topic=TELNET&web=Main&PHPSESSID=f8ddaf5ffd9f0a39d8dad9346c0a8c36">TELNET</a> <wikitopic TELNET /wikitopic>terminal displays octets in <nolink>ASCII symbols. An <nolink>EBCDIC terminal displays octets in <nolink>EBCDIC symbols.
</P><P>
Octets, like those stored in any file, can be printed with a generic printer. When you send a file to an <nolink>ASCII printer, octets are interpreted and printed as <nolink>ASCII symbols. When you send a file to an <nolink>EBCDIC printer, octets are interpreted and printed as <nolink>EBCDIC symbols.
</P><P>
<nolink>ASCII symbols have never been stored in a text file. A program has translated <nolink>ASCII symbols to octets. Only the octets are stored.
</P><P>
Source code from so many programming languages is interpreted as <nolink>ASCII or <nolink>EBCDIC symbols. As a file, it is an anonymous collection of octets.
<H4>Step 6. Octet reuse.</H4>
The most important feature of a computer is octet reuse. The computer has unparalleled ability to reuse octets by translation. A computer doesn't understand the higher meaning of octets. It is garbage in, garbage out.
</P><P>
Let's look at a Java class file. A computer is unable to translate the octets in a class file without the help of an interpreter. An interpreter is an interpreter even if it has a high sounding name like "virtual machine".
</P><P>
It is unthinkable to create a file subsystem that only allows the original application to manipulate the octets in a file. The subsystem would not be able to copy, delete or move files. We would be unable to "pipe" the output from one program as the input to another.
<UL> <LI> Think about this: The anonymous nature of all files is demonstrated by a system-wide clipboard, found in Windows and elsewhere. Any kind of file can be copied to the clipboard. The clipboard is an anonymous file function. Any kind of file can be pasted from the system-wide clipboard to any application.
<LI> Think about this: Notepad, Wordpad and Word are all capable of editing an <nolink>ASCII text file. If I compose a file in Notepad, I can add to it in Wordpad and print it with Word.
<LI> Think about this: If javac creates a class file, only javac would be able to open the class file. Other tools, such as javah, javap, java, javaw, jre, jrew, would not be able to open the class file. The next generation operating system should associate javah, javap, java, javaw, jre, jrew with the .class extension or application/class mine type.
<LI> Think about this: If a file subsystem prevents other programs from opening files owned by others, there could be no client/server connections. When a server creates a file, only the server can open it. When a client creates a file, only the client can open it.
</UL> <H4>Step 7. One of each.</H4>
Taking this to the next and final level, you can have more than one version of an application, and this should be encouraged.
<UL> <LI> For example, I have installed a half dozen different JDKs. Which <a href="/view.php?topic=JDK&web=Main&PHPSESSID=f8ddaf5ffd9f0a39d8dad9346c0a8c36">JDK</a> <wikitopic JDK /wikitopic>should be associated with a .class file? An operating system cannot infer which <nolink>JDK I want to use. Certainly, it must not assume I always want to use the last installed. The last one I installed was a disaster. If I install <nolink>JDK #6 and do not like it, I should be able to remove <nolink>JDK #6. The operating system should "remember" that I still have JDKs #1 through #5.
<LI> I have installed a half dozen different <a href="/view.php?topic=HTML&web=Main&PHPSESSID=f8ddaf5ffd9f0a39d8dad9346c0a8c36">HTML</a> <wikitopic HTML /wikitopic>browsers. Which <nolink>HTML browser should be associated with an .html file? All of them should. When it comes time for me to open such a file, I should allowed to choose. An operating system must not guess. An operating system should not choose for me. Again, the last browers I installed was a disaster. If I install browser #6 and do not like it, I should be able to remove browser #6. The operating system should "remember" that I still have browsers #1 through #5.
</UL> The reality for most technicians is not "one-size-fits-all", but "one of each". As a author writing with <nolink>HTML, I need to know how my page looks in each browser. I need one of each. I need each version of each brand of <nolink>HTML browser. Today, I would need six different machines for Microsoft Internet Explorer alone because Microsoft won't let me install two versions at the same time on one machine.
</P><P>
Neither file extension or mime type is the right answer. What advantage is there in building one-size-fits-all? The only advantage might be an economic one. The advantage goes to the vendor. A commercial vendor has reason to seek a monopoly. If you can only associate one application with each file extension or mime type, a commercial vendor can build a mini-monopoly for a particular kind of file.
<H4>Experiment</H4>
In 1987, I built an experimental program that, unlike Windows Explorer, offered a complete choice when you "open" a file. Here is an outline of how it worked.
<OL> <LI> I created a pre-defined list of file extension groups. For example, I built a list of all "ASCII text" files, something like this: .bat, .c, .cc, .conf, .cpp, .h, .hpp, .html, .ini, .log, .sc, .txt
<LI> Each application provides a "mask" for the files it can open. The mask was a list of file extensions or pre-defined file extension groups. An editor might associate itself with the pre-defined list of "ASCII text" files. For its own special extension, it provides a custom file extension.
</OL> <H4>Offer an appropriate choice.</H4>
The solution is simple. Always try to offer an appropriate choice. Imagine a restaurant has a 300+ page menu. How big would its sampler have to be? Would you invite a group to eat there? How long would it take you to order? A 300+ page menu would be rediculous. Such a long menu would make me uncomfortable.
</P><P>
A restaurant can be more friendly by simplifying the menu. A menu designer sits down and asks, "How often does anyone want this?" <nolink>McDonald's was one of the first fast-food restaurants to tap into an appropriate choice. They did not reduce the number of items on the menu. Rather, they invented the combination of a meal with order-by-number, where a meal is a burger, fries and a drink.
<H4>An operating system must offer you an appropriate choice, not make decisions for you.</H4>
An operating system is like a restaurant. It offers you a choice. Instead of serving up a burger and fries, it serves up applications, programs and services. My operating system easily has a 300+ page menu. At least six months were needed for me to know it.
</P><P>
Like a restaurant, an operating system can be more friendly by shortening its menu. A desktop offers you a choice amoung popular applications (and files). A desktop is more friendly than a command line because a desktop offers a shorter menu. A desktop is like <nolink>McDonald's order-by-number. It cannot replace a command line because an operating system must offer a large quantity of applications.
</P><P>
Is a short menu always friendly? Is a long menu always unfriendly? A short menu can be unfriendly at times. For example, <nolink>McDonald's order-by-number would be unfriendly if you don't "want fries with that".
</P><P>
A long menu can be friendly at times, too. A long menu is most friendly to an expert. An expert knows their choices and the menu supports any decision they might want to make. Experts love a command line. A command line <STRONG>is</STRONG> a menu.
</P><P>
A menu enjoyed by an expert might be equally frightening to a novice. A novice does not yet know what they are doing. It is difficult for a novice to make an appropriate decision. A novice has no idea what to do when confronted with a command line prompt. The prompt itself is usually no help at all.
</P><P>
Should you take all choice away from an expert for the sake of a novice? Some people believe in permanently taking away your choice. They would like to replace a command line with a desktop. Experience has already shown that both are needed.
</P><P>
Using object-oriented approach, a file is-an object. An object is selected first. An appropriate message (verb) is then sent to the selected object. An interactive request to "open" a file should ask: With what? That is always the question the operating system can't answer for you. The operating system should display a comprehensive list of all applications that could possibly "open" a file.
</P><P>
<EM>How do you answer the question?</EM>
</P><P>
Here is the long and short of it.
<OL> <LI> You choose by "installation" which application(s) should appear on your long list. From the long list, you can choose any application that indicates its compatibility with this kind of file.
<LI> You choose by "configuration" which application(s) should appear on your short list. From the short list, you can order-by-number. If you choose only one application for your short list, the operating system opens a file without having to ask. If you choose more than one, the operating system asks you to choose. You have to choose every time you open a kind of file because you put more than one application on your short list.
</OL> If you choose to install a primative command, such as copy, delete, move, etc, the primative command tells the operating system that it is compatible with all kinds of files. These commands will appear on the long list for all kinds of files.
</P><P>
I think an operating system can organize a menu by relevance, just like a search engine. The most relevant commands would be on top. Generic commands are least relevant. Relevance might be tempered by most recently used.
</P><P>
Like the Start menu from Windows, applications should be organized by author. The author is a critical attribute of an application. Unlike the Start menu, I do not believe that an individual should be able to delete applications from the menu without removing the application from the system.
</P><P>
<H4>True story</H4>
Here is a true story from one company where I work as a consultant. Some of their security is based on a strategy of "out of sight, out of mind." A few people became convinced that an MS-DOS box is a security risk. They believe it is a security risk because it puts too much power in the hands of the operator. They believe it offers too much choice. It allows you to run any program, even a program you're not supposed to run. Since then, it has become popular for technicians to delete the menu option for the MS-DOS box. They mistakenly believe their computers are more "secure". But, deleting the menu option does not remove a program. Any program can be run from the Run option. Any program can be run by creating a shortcut.
<H4>Configure an application</H4>
I would like to configure an application. Desktop and menu is an attribute of each application. The desktop attribute is yes or no and determines if an application icon should be displayed on any desktop. The menu attribute is yes or no and determines if an application icon should appear on any menu. If you want an application icon to appear on the desktop, you go to the application and change its configuration. Set desktop=yes and its icon will appear on all desktops. If you want an application icon to appear on a menu, you go to the application and change its configuration. Set start menu=yes and its icon will appear on all menus.
</P><P>
Here is the most important part: If you delete an application, its icon will automatically drop off desktops and menus everywhere. If you move an application from one directory to another, its icon will automatically link to the right place. If you copy an application to another directory, two icons will appear on a desktop (one for each copy) and two icons will appear on a menu (one for each copy).
</P><P>
All versions of all desktops and all versions of all menus can use application configuration to provide appropriate choice simultaneously. A browser and shell can use an application's configuration, too.
<H4>About Windows</H4>
File associations in Windows work best under the following conditions:
<UL> <LI> If each file extension were controlled; if each were unique. In a competitive world, this cannot exist. This works only if you work at Microsoft. They acts as if an operating system vendor has the unlimited right to confiscate any useful file extension. I have a long list of file extensions that they has confiscated with total disregard for its competitors. For example, the .doc extension was confiscated by Microsoft a long time ago -- even though it was already being used on UNIX, CP/M and MS-DOS by other vendors. Microsoft Word could have used a .word extension, <EM>and maybe it should have</EM>. The .html extension was confiscated by Microsoft recently -- even though it was already being used by millions of people on the Internet. Internet Explorer could have used an .msie extension, _and maybe it should have.
<LI> If each version of an application were to use its own unique extension. This has been largely successful. Look at the plethora of unique extensions for spreadsheets. While they are all spreadsheet files, there are so many different extensions nobody can remember them all.
<LI> Or, if only one version of an application were to be installed on a machine. In other words, you can't play around with a new version while you continue to use the original to get your work done. Developers rarely have one version of anything. Meeting the needs of developers would also meet the needs of everyone else.
</UL> <H4>Summary</H4>
This concept should not be confused with the implementation of file associations in traditional operating systems. An operating system can use file associations to help you get your work done. The top issues are:
<UL> <LI> Files and programs have a many-to-many relationship. A modern operating system must maintain a database of file associations, not a flat list of one file type equals one program.
<LI> A modern operating system must provide both security and version control on its file association database. Default security for a process must not include the authorization to change file associations. Version control must enable you to view the complete history of each file association, so that file associations can be repaired with confidence.
