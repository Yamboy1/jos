<P><I>Que çera, çera</I></P>
<P>Working with a future reference makes me think of these words: Que çera, çera. This is a popular saying in Italian that means <I>what will be, will be</I>. It was used in a song made famous by Dorris Day. If it's spelled wrong, I'm sorry. I don't spell in Italian.</P>

</TD>
<TD>
<P>As human beings, we want to make sense of everything. We have many questions. We want our questions answered. We have invented many devices over the centuries, including computers, to help us understand our world. We want to understand more about our world. Historically, a large part of the funding to build a computing machine comes from people seeking to understand our world.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">Prediction</FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>As human beings, we have questions about the future. We want to "know" more about the future. Will I be pretty? Will I be rich? Answering questions like these is difficult, if not impossible. There's no way to say with certainty how things will turn out. Accurate prediction is just beyond our reach.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the computing machine theory is simple:
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>If only</STRONG> we could work on something that we know for sure is never going to change...
<LI><STRONG>If only</STRONG> we could collect enough data about its past and analyse it fast enough...
<LI><STRONG>If only</STRONG> we could find the right algorythm and process...
<LI><STRONG>If only</STRONG> we could find the right model...
<LI>...<STRONG>we could predict its future.</STRONG>

<FONT FACE="Arial">Where is it going to be?</FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>It is the same when building an <nolink>API. We want to "know" how future classes are going to be implemented.</P>
<P>An interface is a future reference. When an interface is created, there are no classes that implement that interface yet. An interface is focused on the future. An interface is created to let a program know where the functionality is going to be. With an interface, the functionality isn't there yet. It is planned. It is promised. It is yet to come.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDHT="20%">
<FONT FACE="Arial">Divide and conquer</FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>An interface is used to reference many classes, in theory, that haven't been built yet. We use future references to divide a complex puzzle into solvable problems. Imagine that! You can begin to describe part of a class without understanding it in its entirety.</P>
<P>There are rare cases. I have found a few rare cases where there must be only one implementation of a critical class. There is no point in building an interface when there is only one class. It would be a waste of time.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDHT="20%">
<FONT FACE="Arial">Birth of an interface</FONT>
</TD>
<TD><P>Where does an interface come from? Interfaces can come from studying a few existing classes. By far, the most frequent case is building an interface to clean up a collection of existing classes. After having built a few classes, we can see clearly that they have a few things in common we could leverage. When moving from classes to a common interface, we are backing into an interface.</P>
<P>Interfaces can come from a wish list. We can work with the way the classes should work in a perfect world. An interface may be designed with a perfect set of methods, and then, we set out to figure out how to write the methods. When moving from a common interface to custom classes, we are using future reference.</P>
<P>We really want the method to have this name, these parameters and this return value. The method prototype written into an interface doesn't guarantee the method will do what it is supposed to. The purpose of the interface is to open the window of opportunity. At least with an interface, we can get the syntax right. At least, we have a fighting chance.</P>
</TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDHT="20%">
<FONT FACE="Arial">Modeling helps</FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Is this going to be the perfect <nolink>API? Answering a question like this is difficult. Nobody wants to make a world famous <nolink>API for dead-end software. Modeling helps. We can manage the risk of implementing a dead-end framework by modeling with interfaces.</P>
<P>A future reference helps save time. When modeling an <nolink>API, we can delay full implementation until we are more comfortable with the interface. We can write sample code against an interface, to see how (and if) it it is going to work. We can use the interface in a snippet of code. By delaying implementation, we reduce the risk of fully implementing some design that's going to be thrown away. When modeling an <nolink>API, the interface is a great tool because lots of design issues can be worked through without wasting time fully implementing every design.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDHT="20%">
<FONT FACE="Arial">Like a promise</FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>An interface is something like a promise. There are hints and clues to programmers using the interface about what any future implementation should do. Requestors must call methods of an interface, that's true. But the implementation of an interface can do anything, anything it wants. While requestors must keep their promise, the responder doesn't have to. And this is a good thing. It allows a design to remain flexible and open ended.</P>
<P>Many people say that the Java interface has something to do with multiple inheritence. I disagree, emphatically. It has everything to do with future reference. In practice, <a href="/view.php?topic=COBOL&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=b17bee4296185d217428c793b98b40f0">COBOL</a> <wikitopic COBOL /wikitopic>copybooks and C/C++ header files are distant cousins of the Java interface. <a href="/view.php?topic=COBOL&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=b17bee4296185d217428c793b98b40f0">COBOL</a> <wikitopic COBOL /wikitopic>copybooks contain hints and clues to programmers using data storage and subprograms. C/C++ header files contain hints and clues to programmers using data structures, modules and libraries. The function prototype defines the signature of a function in the same way an interface defines the signature of a method.</P>
<P>One day in the future, we hope we'll be able to buy high quality software. Inside Realign Software, we believe high quality software must be anchored to an immovable interface. Once an interface has been developed, we must not allow anyone to change it. To keep our promise, we must stubbornly refuse to change an old interface, even under extreme political and technical pressure.</P>
<P>We can always build a new interface, using a new namespace.</P>
