<H4>Introduction</H4>
So many parts of the software need to be developed, where do we start? When building system software (stable, reliable, rugged, dependable and high quality) there is only one place to start: from the "bottom".
</P><P>
But, software has neither a "bottom" nor "top". Where is the bottom? One half of the criteria for the bottom is following a dependency chart. Interfaces and sometimes classes have no dependencies on any other classes, so they are at the bottom.
</P><P>
The other half of the criteria to find the bottom of the software is following a functional chart. Any class that functions well enough to help us develop and work on other classes are already part of the foundation, so they become part of the bottom.
</P><P>
A class on the bottom must have no unfinished dependencies.
</P><P>
<STRONG>Procedure</STRONG> The procedure to build things from the bottom up starts with specifics cases and moves toward the general case. It builds upon real world experience to find and retain the best practices. The use of this process is wrapped up in the following diagram:
<UL> <LI> Loop 1: Do
<LI> Loop 2: Document
<LI> Loop 3: Standardize
<LI> Loop 4: Industrialize
</UL> <H4>Loop 1: Do</H4>
The most often repeated step is do. Practice makes perfect. To do something once is useless. From that you cannot determine a cause for success or failure. To do something repeatedly is better. You are developing a process. With a process, you can figure out how to suspect success and failure. To do something with consistent and predictable results gives you an opportunity to improve the process. And, yes, a process is still a process even without written documentation.
<UL> <LI> If you need an application suite, build it.
<LI> If you need an application, build it.
<LI> If you need a subsystem, build it.
<LI> If you need a package, build it.
<LI> If you need a class, build it.
<LI> If you need an interface, build it.
<LI> If you need a method, build it.
</UL> <H4>Loop 2: Document</H4>
Learn from the experience. What should have been the <nolink>API of that subsystem? What would you do differently if you had an opportunity to do it all over again? After you find something that definitely works or definitely does not work, then you document. You see a pattern (general case) from all of your practice (each special case). When you think you see a useful pattern, test your theory. Don't document something you know nothing about. In the evolution of Linux, the documentation project was started long after the kernel could be used and well understood, <EM>and should have been</EM>.
<H4>Loop 3: Standardize</H4>
The last thing you want to do is standardize. You want to standardize sometime, but, for goodness sake, standardize on something that's going to work.
</P><P>
The rush to standardize has been the fatal flaw with JINI, Network Computers, XML, CORBA, <a href="/view.php?topic=OpenDoc&PHPSESSID=54415ccdb7ce900493939154b0daa879">OpenDoc</a><wikitopic OpenDoc /wikitopic> and lots of other bleeding edge technology. Unfortunately, this could be a fatal flaw for Java, too. People are trying to force fit the real world experience inside a half-baked standard rather than innovating a satisfying technical solution. Historically, all of the wildly successful standards (TCP/IP, RDBMS, SQL, HTML) have been practiced long before they were standardized. TCP/IP includes TELNET, FTP, HTTP. Look at the successful approach of growing the Internet through standards that have already been proven to work.
</P><P>
<nolink>COBOL is often cited as "proof" that you can standardize first and then build a product. The people writing the <nolink>COBOL standard had years of practice in languages and knew for a certainty it would work from a technical perspective. That's why experts were invited to work on the <nolink>COBOL standard. They had a lot of practice with what would become known as <nolink>COBOL before the <nolink>COBOL standard was created.
<H4>Loop 4: Industrialize</H4>
When a useful standard becomes universally adopted, it has been industrialized. The industry is always moving toward a better industry practice. The industry adopted binary digits, finite state machines, boolean logic, microcode, stored programs and subroutines. The industry has not dropped all other network protocols in favor of TCP/IP. It is far less likely for the industry to adopt any user interface, development method, programming language or operating system. It has never happened before. GUI, OO, Java and Linux won't become industrialized. Sorry, but in the young software industry, there are so very few standards have been fully industrialized.
<UL> <LI> Did you know, for example, that there is a controversy around the use of the <nolink>GOTO statement down to this day? Even Java supports its own form of the <nolink>GOTO statement and labels.
<LI> Structured method has not been fully industrialized. Top-down approach has been under attack lately. It doesn't produce the expected results when working in the large. Many system programmers have been using the bottom-up approach all along because it works, <EM>regardless</EM> of what's said in the popular press.
<LI> Object-oriented method has a long way to go before it is industrialized. Parts of the approach are misunderstood, misapplied and mistaught. It will be a long time before all that is straighted out.
<LI> Iconic interface has proven to be attractive to the first time computer user. Beyond that attraction, the model has lots of problems when users want to move to the next level. With this kind of interface, you can't get there from here. It doesn't prepare you. It doesn't teach you the kind of things you'll need to know.
<LI> Graphical user interface, a mouse and object-oriented approach has been promoted as the answer to everything that's wrong with software. After using these things, what's wrong with software is still here. Software doesn't help us to get our unplanned, unscheduled, unexpected work done. And that's about 77% of the work, on average, we have to do.</UL> <BR><BR></P><!--
