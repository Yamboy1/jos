<P><EM>Article contributed by <a href="/view.php?topic=GilbertHerschberger&PHPSESSID=87aacd60fc92061ba48106b9206f5cbf">GilbertHerschberger</a><wikitopic GilbertHerschberger /wikitopic> (27 Nov 1999).</EM><P>
<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>As a programmer, I have more than one role in a typical software development project. As an application programmer, I develop the software that people use to get their work done. While building a typical end-user application, I prefer to use rapid application development, <a href="/view.php?topic=GUI&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=87aacd60fc92061ba48106b9206f5cbf">GUI</a> <wikitopic GUI /wikitopic>tools and build things from the top down.</P>
<P>As a system programmer, I develop software that programmers use to build applications. While building a typical subsystem, I prefer to use systems analysis, prototypes, and build things from the bottom up.</P>
<H4>About an operating system</H4>
<P>An operating system is a subsystem. It is more complex than a typical subsystem. But it is considered a subsystem because the picture is not complete with the operating system alone. It must have its utility software, and eventually, its applications.</P>
<P>The development process for an operating system is quite extensive and involved. It is quite extensive because there are many subsystems that need to be available to the operating system. A <EM>file</EM> subsystem is a good example of one subsystem that an operating system depends on.</P>
<P>Developing an operating system is involved because it requires great coordination among members of programming community.</P>
<H4>Process</H4>
<P>We should be prepared. We need to know when a subsystem is finished and ready to be tested. We need to know when a subsystem hasn't been started yet. We need to know when we cannot start on a subsystem because a dependent subsystem hasn't been tested yet.</P>
<P>At some point, we need to test the operating system. The operating system is big. It's huge. It might involve a hundred thousands line of source code or more. Where do we start? We start at the beginning. When do we start testing? We test each peice as we go along.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>Is it possible to test an operating system?</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>One for-profit software company makes operating systems. They excuse themselves from all efforts to test their own code. They take no responsibility for the quality of their product. They claim that an operating system can't be tested and any effort to test would be a waste of their time (read money). They push the testing of their code onto their paying customers.</P>
<P>This for-profit company has a long-standing policy of closed source. The code is considered a trade secret.</P>
<P>When a company doesn't test their own code <EM>and</EM> considers their own code to be a secret, they can't build high quality software. They can't sustain innovation. They can't depend on a ready market with each version they introduce.</P>
<H4>Extreme testing</H4>
<P>From the principles of <a href="/view.php?topic=ExtremeProgramming&PHPSESSID=87aacd60fc92061ba48106b9206f5cbf">ExtremeProgramming</a><wikitopic ExtremeProgramming /wikitopic>, we know that it is possible to test all software. It is possible to test software as large as an operating system. It makes sense to apply appropriate tests as software is developed. Each class distributed has a corresponding test class. This "extra" test class demonstrates the behavior of a production class for everyone.</P>
<P>Test classes are like sample programs. They demonstrate the way a class should be used. They do not need to be "black box" tests. When a class is broken, everybody works together to fix it. Between an old and a new class, a new classes always has lower priority. New functionality is never added until all the old functionality is finished.</P>
<H4>Bottom up testing</H4>
<P>It is never too soon to start thinking about a test suite. In this case, the first test suite starts at the beginning, before there's any bytecode. We must be able to demonstrate that we can boot a machine into our machine code. That is an early kind of test.</P>
<P>Such a test is documented so that everyone can try the test at home, on their own equipment. It helps diagnose broken hardware.</P>
<H4>Power-On Self-Test</H4>
<P>In this case, the decaf virtual machine should have its own power-on self-test. These are lots of extra machine code subroutines that the <a href="/view.php?topic=JVM&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=87aacd60fc92061ba48106b9206f5cbf">JVM</a> <wikitopic JVM /wikitopic>will perform prior to loading or interpreting the first byte of bytecode. When jJOS asks decaf to perform a power-on self-test, it should.</P>
<P>The power-on self-test usually means lots of code that is invoked only once. The subroutines start out by checking the most primative assumptions. The tests get more complex as they work their way up to loading the first bytecode. After bytecode is loaded for the first time, a new level of assumptions can be checked.</P>
<P>A <a href="/view.php?topic=JVM&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=87aacd60fc92061ba48106b9206f5cbf">JVM</a> <wikitopic JVM /wikitopic>needs to know if its own executable image has been corrupted in transport. A power-on self-test aborts the entire process when an assertion fails. This protect the machine from running unknown machine code.</P>
<P>The power-on self-test goes hand-in-hand with bottom up testing. As the power-on self-test is written, it demonstrates the dependencies between subsystems. The system that's needed first at runtime is tested first by the software developers.</P>
<H4>Where's the bottom?</H4>
<P>The "bottom" is an imaginary thing. Software has neither a bottom nor a top. When a class is written on a foreign OS and runs unchanged on <nolink>JOS, is there need for additional testing?</P>
<P>The bottom is the collection of classes you have already tested. These are the dependable classes you have come trust. But, a class tested on some other OS must not be trusted to run on <nolink>JOS. Even when it is unchanged, a class must be tested on <nolink>JOS to see how it works on <nolink>JOS. For all Java applications running on a foreign OS, they must be tested again on <nolink>JOS.</P>
<P>It is irresponsible to write a class and then -- without further testing -- running it elsewhere. Platform-specific classes are inherent in any platform-independent architecture. The interaction between platform-specific and other classes must be demonstrate-able by a test suite.</P>
<H4>Test framework</H4>
<P>A test framework is something of a catch-22. A test framework depends on some of the classes its testing. A power-on self-test can't test for everything.</P>
<P>It is possible to break the dependency a test framework has on the classes it is testing by building a completely separate version of classes used by the framework. The framework is stored separately. The mechanism to start the framework is separate.</P>
<P>Invoking a <CODE>public static void main( String[] )</CODE> method is a convention. A virtual machine is not required to invoke a static method. It is not even required to invoke a method called main(). The test suite for low-level features in a <a href="/view.php?topic=JVM&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=87aacd60fc92061ba48106b9206f5cbf">JVM</a> <wikitopic JVM /wikitopic>should use some other mechanism to start the test. Just about any other mechanism will do.</P>
<P>The power-on self-test needs an interface. Typically, a power-on self-test uses a built-in <a href="/view.php?topic=BIOS&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=87aacd60fc92061ba48106b9206f5cbf">BIOS</a> <wikitopic BIOS /wikitopic>function to print a error message, byte by byte. It has no log because a log has too many dependencies.</P>
<P>A test suite needs a log. A test suite might find an error in one package, but continue to test other (unrelated) packages. The log keeps a record of tests that were run, tests that passed and failed.</P>
<H4>About a new OS</H4>
<P>A new OS should be tested. When you choose an OS vendor, choose one that takes responsibility for the code they write. When you choose an OS vendor, choose one that provides you a test suite to demonstrate the features of the OS. Ready-made excuses about time (and money) used by an OS vendor are bogus. Testing software is part of the cost of doing business. High quality software is achieve-able. Test at every step along the way.</P><BR><BR></P><!--
