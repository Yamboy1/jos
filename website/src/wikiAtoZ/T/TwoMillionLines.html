<H4>Introduction</H4>
Whew, what an adventure! It has been a singular accomplishment to write two million lines of Java source code. I desire to savor my success, as my wife strongly recommends. Looking back, I wonder if others could benefit from what I have learned. Here is my story.
<H4>From other languages</H4>
The Java programming language isn't my first. I had learned a number of programming languages by the time I met Java. It was like love at first sight. I recognized the basic elegance of the language because of the way it squarely addressed the limitations and inconsistencies in these other languages.
</P><P>
I remember how I felt at the time. I wanted to learn Java. I wanted to earn my living as a Java programmer. And yet, I knew nothing about compiling code, nothing about the standard class library, nothing about tools and techniques.
</P><P>
So, I immersed myself in it. I bought a couple of books. I started out by writing many small programs that demonstrated a specific feature of the standard class library.
<H4>How I know</H4>
In 1996, I decided I wanted to keep track. I had to organize my Java source code so that I could measure the number of lines. I wrote a Java program to do the grunt work. I wasn't surprised when I reached the 500,000 mark. I was reasonably prolific. I quickly reached one million. Just the thought of one million lines amazed me. It took me three years of working at the keyboard, producing lines of code that actually work.
<H4>Like that</H4>
Again and again, I have been impressed and then disappointed.
</P><P>
At first, I was relieved. The static main() mechanism was better than C/C++. I thought it was a good thing. But now I believe it is an embarrassment to Java technology. It is not very object oriented. Static methods are not quite inherited and cannot be overridden. After developing a dozen small programs, it became obvious that this would never work for programming in-the-large. Soon, the Application interface was born. This became the ground work for the Subprogram <nolink>API. In turn, the Subprogram <nolink>API was extended to include a model for unit test programs.
</P><P>
At first, I was excited about Java applets. I quickly discovered unbelievable limitations in the deployment of applets to a mix of <nolink>HTML browsers. Other people have their favorite <nolink>HTML browser; it quickly became un-manageably complex. This led to the development of a stand-alone applet browser.
</P><P>
At first, I was excited about the java.net.URL class. Here was something that could not be done so easily in C/C++. But then, I became disappointed because, unfortunately, the implementation of schemes is tied to a pattern of package names.
</P><P>
Without a moments hesitation, I disliked the introduction of jars. Even now, it requires much effort (and specialized tools) to maintain a collection of compatible jars. This led to the development of a more elegant, but little known, package file format.
</P><P>
With the introduction of the Invocation <nolink>API, it became possible to develop the eric tool. It starts a Java Virtual Machine and invoke an arbitrary subprogram. Classes are, of course, stored in package files.
</P><P>
At first, I enjoyed the java.io package. After writing dozens of classes that depend on I/O, I enjoyed it less and less. It became tedious. I found myself repeatedly writing the same code. I wanted to put the common code into a class library, but how? This led to the Smart <nolink>API. Here was a breakthrough for putting common code into a library. It was a multiple stage object factory, a factory of factories. Through a technique of scheme chaining, it became possible to move the most tedious code out of my custom program.
</P><P>
<H4>Things change</H4>
The Java Servlet <nolink>API is one of my favorite things. It enables me to develop a web application with great confidence. I have seen really bad examples of servlet code in books on the subject. This led to the development of a servlet-transaction model, demonstrated by <nolink>PersonalWiki.
</P><P>
Java Servlets and <nolink>JDBC is a winning combination. Business web applications enable me to earn a living as a professional Java programmer.
</P><P>
Over time, the Java development platform has been improved. For example, Ant can replace <nolink>BulkMake. Java on Linux is no longer a second-class platform. Borland <nolink>JBuilder is now available for Linux.<BR><BR></P><!--
