<FONT FACE="Arial">Question</FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>So you want an open operating system. You have set out to build it with plenty of determination and enthusiasm. You have collected together the technical expertise. You are willing to work hard and make personal sacrifices to make it happen. Ask yourself this question:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>What does it mean to be open vs. closed? And why do we want open in our software?</STRONG>
</UL>
<P>People have been enthusiastic about a lot of things in the software industry over the years. People have made personal sacrifice in order to let computer software live up to its full potential. People have been enthusiastic about sharing, open standards, collaboration and freedom for a long time.</P>
<P>The software industry has seen commercial software, public domain software, free software and open source software. Yet, we still have reason to complain about the current state of the software industry.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="20%">
<FONT FACE="Arial">Spectrum</FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Open vs. closed is a matter of subjective judgement. What is open enough for one is still too closed for another. Open and closed are part of one spectrum. Open is at one end and closed is at the other. It is not binary, like a light switch, but a full spectrum, like a light dimmer. It is not a point on a circle, but a full arc, like the swing of a door.</P>
<P>Let us consider the puzzle of a door. When do you consider a door to be open? In the end, a door is "open" when it serves the purpose of an open door. If a door is opened enough for you to squeeze through, it is open enough.
<UL>
<LI>Suppose a door is open just half way. It is just as much "closed" as "open". Whether the door open or closed depends on whether or not you can walk through the door. If you can walk through, it serves the purpose of an open door.
<LI>Suppose a door has been opened a crack about 1 cm. It is almost closed, but not quite. It is not open, not closed, but somewhere in between. Since most of us couldn't squeeze through the 1 cm crack, it doesn't serve the purpose of an open door.
</UL></P>
<P>The scientific community won't create a precise measure for whether a door is opened or closed. Such a measurement would be a waste of time. How would you feel about an elite group that makes up a rule like this:
<UL>
<LI><I>A door that has a span of more than 90 degrees shall be considered "open" after it swings away more than 49.4 degrees from a position of fully closed.</I>
</UL>
<P>Rediculous! And yet, the software industry does stuff like this all of the time.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="20%">
<FONT FACE="Arial">Software</FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Determining whether software is open or closed requires subjective judgement. Every person must decide if a program is open enough. If it helps them get their work done and they are happy with the direction the vendor is going, it serves the purpose of open software.
<UL>
<LI>Suppose a program has been created in a laboratory somewhere to support an open protocol, like Oracle supports <a href="/view.php?topic=SQL&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=c7bb9be55100367d1605cf1ed89f7f3a">SQL</a> <wikitopic SQL /wikitopic>or Netscape Navigator supports <nolink>HTTP. Does an open protocol make open software? Software should be open enough for you to get your work done. For many, proprietary software using an open protocol is good enough and they consider the software to be open.
<LI>Suppose another program, like JDK, has been created in a laboratory somewhere as a challenge to the competition. Does a proprietary standard make closed software? Sun Microsystems decided to give the <a href="/view.php?topic=JDK&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=c7bb9be55100367d1605cf1ed89f7f3a">JDK</a> <wikitopic JDK /wikitopic>away, and at the same time, procrastinate on the international standardization process and limit the technology to licensees, for a fee. For many, free software using a closed protocol is good enough and they consider the software to be open.
<LI>Suppose parts of a program have been created in laboratories all over the world and given away for free. Does free software make open software? The Free Software Foundation has a policy of exclusion that cuts themselves off from perfectly good software just because it isn't free. Freedom to choose software includes the freedom to choose commercial software, too. For many, software without fair negotiation over price is not good enough and they consider free software to be closed.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="20%">
<FONT FACE="Arial">Negotiation</FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Negotiation may be the key to openess. More than anything else, <STRONG>open</STRONG> means fully able to negotiate. An open approach works on enabling fair negotiation. An open approach breaks down barriers wherever possible.</P>
<P><STRONG>Closed</STRONG> means disabling negotiation, eroding the ability to negotiate. A closed approach works on raising barriers, creating obstacles, and obtaining/maintaining an unfair advantage over your customer, suppliers and competitors. Anything that increases your advantage for your side excludes all others from the decision making process.</P>
<P>Price is not the issue. While many people have tried to make a connection between openess and price, there is none. A few commercial, for-profit vendors have an open approach. They are dilligent to negotiate in good faith and to make things fair to everyone.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="20%">
<FONT FACE="Arial">Openess required</FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Closed approach is not a long-term option for any vendor. It doesn't matter what industry a vendor is in. Working toward disabling all choices for a consumer is not a viable strategy. Inevidably, a market will make a correction. Consumers will abandon a vendor taking choices away and move to a vendor that offers more choice. A vendor taking away choices takes a stranglehold on the consumer. Consumers always grow up and grow tired of it.</P>
<P>A closed approach is a risky short-term option. With certain finess and impecable timing, a vendor can win big by taking away customer choice for a short time. The advantage goes to the vendor. When a vendor offers something unique and valuable, consumers are smart enough to give up choice in exchange for something so valuable. Consumers are willing to pay a premium for the product or service, <I>and should be</I>. A vendor providing such a breakthrough should be rewarded in the short-term. No harm, no foul.</P>
<P>The trouble starts brewing when a vendor expects to maintain their monopoly for decades. Consumers are smart enough to realise they could get more innovation and better prices if there's healthy competition. Consumers get more sophisticated over time. They aren't willing to give up their choice forever in exchange for something that they start to take for granted.</P>
<P>Are you afraid of a little competition? Vendors with a closed approach are cowards, afraid of healthy competition. They don't believe in a free market. During a market correction, they will be abandoned by their customers, suppliers and competitors. They will be left out in the cold to fend for themselves, rejected by the community because they didn't play fair.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">Mercy!</FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>When you must use software, you are at the mercy of the programmer's attitude, whims and wishes. Open software works toward opening up the programmer's mind so that other options are considered.</P>
<P>It doesn't matter whether you buy a shrink-wrapped program for a fee or download a free software off of the web. You end up at the same place. You are at the mercy of the programmer. You have no control over the way the program works. If you want the program to change, you must negotiate with programmers.</P>
<P>There is a distinct advantage of becoming a programmer. You are at your own mercy. For some things, you only have to negotiate with yourself. As a programmer, you are in control. If only it were possible to write everything yourself, you wouldn't have to be at the mercy of other programmers.</P>
<P>Open source software is a comfort to some. There is a deliberate attempt to create a forum for people to negotiate with programmers.
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Beginners</STRONG> are attracted to open source because they can read lots and lots of source code to learn how it is really done. A programmer is better off learning from real source code than learning from wimpy little sample programs found in books. They can virtually look over the shoulder of expert programmers from around the world. They can learn from the best, and if all goes well, become the best.
<LI><STRONG>Experts</STRONG> are attracted to open source because they can read lots and lots of source code to compare it to their own. Even experts can learn a thing or two. Next, experts are attracted to the challenge of letting others read all their code. It is a test of courage. It is a test of skill. Surviving it is the highest reward, the last plateau in a rite of passage.
</UL></P>
<P>Commercial software is comforting to others. There is an awkward forum (the market) for people to negotiate with programmers. The decision making process is oversimplified. They theorize that if the market is willing to pay more for a program, the program must be better somehow. They can keep on using the price of the software and copies "sold" to keep score.</P>
<P>Open software goes beyond price and programmers reading source code. It is about consumers having a say. It is about making more room to make choices. Consumers should be able to negotiate how their software works. Open software embraces special interest groups. When any program gives the customer what they want, it serves the purpose of open software.</P>
<P>It is difficult to build open software. It is especially difficult to build open operating system software. Why? An operating system is built especially for programmers. Programmers are especially demanding. They want more choices, more options, more alternatives. And they want it now. Programmers have grown quite accustomed to being in total control. They hate lame excuses as much as they hate being told "No."</P>
<P>Linux wouldn't be Linux unless the decision making process was based on fair negotiation. Linux turns the tables and makes everything your problem. If you want something, write it yourself. It gives explicit permission for you to fix it.</P>
<P>Other operating systems have been closed because vendors don't want consumers to have the power to negotiate. They hold tight to total control. They make everything their problem. If you want something, you'll have to wait. You do not have permission to fix their software. You're not even allowed to see what you're buying.</P>
