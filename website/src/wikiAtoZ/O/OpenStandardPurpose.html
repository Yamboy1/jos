<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>What does it mean to have an <EM>open</EM> standard? Why is it important to some people to have a standard and open standard?</P>
<P>A standard is borrowed from physical science. A standard provides a reliable point of reference. Just as there are many standards for distance, area, space, mass, density, and temperature, there are many standards for software. There are many standards for encoding, translation, storage, and transfer. There are many standards for working with data and many more standards for working with code.
<P>When selecting a standard for a scientific experiment, it is customary to refer to an well-known international standard. It is unusual (but possible) for a scientist to select another standard. In a scientific experiment, a standard is selected for each experiment.
</UL>
<H4>Scope</H4>
<P>In software, a standard has different scopes.
<UL>
<LI>Scope may be limited to a single program. You can have a standard way for encoding and decoding data limited to the scope of a single program. The way the program encodes and decodes the data may work only in one program. The program itself is required to read and write data in that format. By far, this is the easiest and most frequently used scope in the software industry.</P>
<LI>Scope may be limited to a programmer. Another level of standard is where more than one program uses the same method to encode and decode. </P>
<LI>Scope may be limited to a programming department. A suite of shink-wrapped commercial programs may share a common standard.</P>
<LI>Scope may be limited to an organization. So many organizations give an individual or department a difficult and arduous task of setting the standard for everyone in the organization.</P>
<LI>Scope may be limited to a industry sector. A few standards are available so that everyone in healthcare, for example, can exchange healthcare-related data.</P>
</UL>
<H4>Non-standards</H4>
<P>While a standard is reliable, a non-standard provides an unreliable point-of-reference or no point-of-reference at all. Something missing or unrealiable isn't very useful. These are matters of personal taste and subjective judgement.</P>
<P>And people tend to exaggerate. What is useful for one is useless to another. In fair competition, you are suppose to criticise your competitors products in good faith, based on what is really wrong with them. It is senseless to say that a product that works should not be used just because it is non-standard.</P>
<P>Most people select their own standards based on how often it works. Something that is non-standard is expected to fail every so often. Calling something non-standard is a warning to all that there are going to be places where it may fail. Using something non-standard increases the risk.</P>
<P>On the other hand, a standard is associated with high quality software. High quality software is expected to work every time. Why would you standardize on something that doesn't work? Something that doesn't work at all may be harder to accept as a standard. Yet, some continue to promote standards that don't work. It's simply irrational.</P>
<P>A standard is a matter of personal taste. What is standard for one is non-standard for another. Saying that someone else is using non-standard software might be just an insult, a slur, and an emotional argument.</P>
<H4>Open standards</H4>
<P><STRONG>de facto</STRONG> Everytime a large software company publishes a program it is standard. Period. No matter what. Everything published by the top 100 software companies are standard within this scope. There is nothing extra they must do. It is, in fact, a standard by its existance. It is a de facto standard.</P>
<P>Is a de facto standard good enough? Sometimes it is; sometimes it's not. When a large software company creates software that works, many people believe that is good enough. Access to a program helps them get their work done.
<P>Isn't it amazing how people don't complain about a closed standard if it works? People don't have much to complain about when things are going along fairly well. No harm, no foul.</P>
<P>Others believe that publishing the compiled form of a program is never good enough. They say such a practice isn't <I>fair</I> and they want vendors to create an open standard. This may come from our experience in the software industry that vendors have a tendency to get way off track. Many vendors show contempt for programmers, even those loyally supporting them.</P>
<P>There is a difference between a standard and an open standard. Open and closed are part of one spectrum. Open is at one end and closed is at the other. An open standard is where the encoding and decoding is published. Sometimes there is a future reference, an expectation that programs will be written to share common encoding and decoding.</P>
<P>There are planned and unplanned standards. Planned and unplanned are part of one spectrum. Planned is at one end and unplanned is at the other. It is a matter of subjective judgement to say one standard was planned and another was not.</P>
<P>The software industry ignores closed and unplanned standards, as if they do not exist. They hide their eyes. They refuse to look. They wish the closed and unplanned standards would go away by themselves.</P>
<P>The purpose of an open standard is found in the reason for publishing an encoding and decoding specification. The specification is published in the hope that more than one programmer will write programs using a common format. Publishing the specification makes an open standard.</P>
<P>Publishing any part of the specification makes a standard open, even if the specification is incomplete or unusable. The publisher just didn't do a very good job. If the publication of a standard doesn't result in the creation of more programs that share a common encoding/decoding, that is evidence of the publisher's failure, not the standard.</P>
<P>When a standard is published, there may never be another program anywhere that uses the standard for encoding and decoding. Does this mean that the standard isn't open? No. When the original program is a subsystem or library that works, it does not make sense for alternatives to be available.</P>
<H4>Operating systems</H4>
<P>Operating systems often fall into a catagory where it does not make sense to publish the specification completely and does not make sense for alternatives to be available. When an operating system is published in compiled form, as in off the shelf, shrink-wrapped software, it does not make sense to include instructions on how to compile the kernel. More than 80% of the market doesn't care.</P>
<P>Operating systems for programmers must be a different story. The other 20% of the market would like to know more about the way the operating system really works on the inside. Any hints about its efficient operation are part of the operating system's specification.</P>
<P>It also doesn't make sense to publish the specification for every extension of the operating system, in device drivers or application software. Extensions are being added every day. The things these drivers and applications must have in common so they work within the operating system should be published.</P>
<H4>In full</H4>
<P>In an extremely open standard, the publisher includes future customers, suppliers and competition in the decision making process. The publisher includes the result of collaboration with everyone on how the encoding and decoding should work. A fully open standard includes publishing the encoding and decoding agreed to by everyone in the group.</P>
<P>Any exclusive standards group cannot create an extremely open standard. When membership in a group is restricted in any way, where members are qualified and screened, the open standard isn't 100% open.</P>
<P>Software history has shown that we don't want an extremely open standard, where any hairbrained mindless individual with a half-baked idea can influence the specification. Extremely open groups usually make extremely stupid standards.</P>
<P>When building compatible software, we want ready-made working subsystems that use open standards. We want expert technicians to be smart, qualified and focused, working to improve the standards continuously. We want expert technicians to specify and publish the encoding and decoding that works. We want these people to show courage and leadership, keeping the standard true and consistent.</P>
<P>The purpose of open standards is to ultimately create digitized data that lasts, subsystems that keep on working, software upgrades that are completely compatible. We expect open standards to somehow bring us the compatibility we want.</P>
<P>When we write our data to disk, we want to write it once.</P>
<P>The software industry has brought us poor quality software in all flavors:
<UL>
<LI>non-standard software that don't work so well.
<LI>closed standards that don't work so well,
<LI>open standards that don't work so well,
<LI>planned standards that don't work so well, and
<LI>unplanned standards that don't work so well.
</UL>
<P>Most of our customers want high quality software. And they don't really care how they get it.<P>
<H4>Publishing</H4>
<P>The method used to publish a standard can take many forms.</P>
<P>Publishing the source code used to encode and decode data exposes the standard to everyone in a blatent way. There are no mistakes. Programmers can read the code and see how everything is done. The intention of the publisher is irrelevant when the source code exposes the standard. The code may produce some undesireable side-effect, and, of course, programmers will find a way to take advantage of it.</P>
<P>The next form of standard is a classic <a href="/view.php?topic=API&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=ee6fe84984fd516da8c32b365525ea79">API</a> <wikitopic API /wikitopic>specification, like the documentation produced by <a href="/view.php?topic=JavaDoc&PHPSESSID=ee6fe84984fd516da8c32b365525ea79">JavaDoc</a><wikitopic JavaDoc /wikitopic>. It is a step away from the source code and highlights the requestor's perspective only.</P>
<P>The next form of publication is the technical documentation or programmer's guide. It has assistance for someone who wants to use software based on the standard, creating software based on the standard, and creating software that implements the standard.
<H4>Creating an open standard</H4>
<P>Creating a fully documented standard can be very expensive and time consuming.
<UL>
<LI>Create a program library that works.
<LI>Create a test suite that works.
<LI>Create example programs that work, to demonstrate and refine
the presentation of concepts,
<LI>Create a technical guide for programmer to use the program
library,
<LI>Create a technical guide for programmers who want to build a
compatible library of their own,
<LI>Create a non-technical guide for customers to use the program
library in products created by yourself and others.
</UL>
<H4>Pseudo-standards</H4>
<P>Many organizations in the software industry use the pseudo-standard. This kind of standard is considered to be the standard way to publish technical information. This kind of documentation has a liberal sprinkling of future reference. It documents why the standard was created and what it is supposed to do (rather than what it does).</P>
<P>The next standard to watch out for is a proposed standard. This can be expensive for everyone. It attempts to <I>find a way</I> to accomplish some goal. It proposes a standard that has never been written into a program. There is no way to know for sure if it is going to work.</P><BR><BR></P><!--
