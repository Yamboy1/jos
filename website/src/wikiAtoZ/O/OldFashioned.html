<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>Programming is all about choice. It's your choice. It's your customer's choice. It is a choice of the marketplace. As a programmer, will you choose the most appropriate technology? This article highlights the influence of fashion on our choices.</P>
<H4>Fashion</H4>
<P>The software industry is influenced heavily by fashion, just like other industries. It is subject to the latest craze. There are fads. While some technologies are hot; some are not.</P>
<P><EM>What's hot this week?</EM></P>
<P>The software industry is influenced by fashion more than other industries, such as the construction industry, the garment industry, the automobile industry, the airline industry and the hardware industry. Other industries have been around a while and have learned to deal with the influence of fashion. The software industry is an <EM>immature</EM> industry. An immature industry is quickly influenced by fashion.</P>
<H4>Priorities</H4>
<P>Keep those priorities straight. Customers <STRONG>need</STRONG> software that works. Customers <STRONG>want</STRONG> software that looks good and goes fast. Customer's <STRONG>wish</STRONG> they had software that would maximize organizational efficiency.</P>
<P>High quality software is based on reality, tempered by fashion. The core competency of software engineering is finding reality, finding things that really work. It uses scientific research. It uses experiments, feedback and experience.</P>
<P>Reality is stable. It is slow to change. What works last year still works this year. It might work, even if it isn't fashionable.</P>
<P>What is important to you? If high quality software is important to you, you'll keep on using the practice that works.</P>
<H4>A little history</H4>
<P>The input-process-output model from the mid-1950s is still working today. Whenever you wish to use a <a href="/view.php?topic=CPU&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=1995e26f93072bafb3485c5be9edf5b0">CPU</a> <wikitopic CPU /wikitopic>(or processor) you must respect the data processing model. It is old, but not old fashioned. The Java virtual machine is a bytecode processor. Input-process-output is its foundation.</P>
<P>The routine/subroutine, program/subprogram models from the early 1970s are still working today. It is old, but not old fashioned. Whenever you wish to build a method with a single entry point, you must respect the structured model.</P>
<P><EM>How old is object-oriented?</EM></P>
<P>The object-oriented approach is old, not old fashioned. The everythings's-an-object models from the mid-1960's is still working today. As an object-oriented programmer, you too must learn to use what works.</P>
<H4>Old fashioned</H4>
<P>Some hot ideas grow cold. Things that should have worked, don't. Things that don't work are old fashioned, <EM>and should be</EM>. They aren't good enough to keep in practice. They should be put away in a closet, a distant memory, ancient history.</P>
<H4>Programs</H4>
<P>Classic programs use standard in/out streams.  It satisfies each of these models, data processing, structured and object-oriented.</P>
<P>It is unfair to catagorize a standard in/out model for programs as "old fashioned." Why? Because it works. It is a valuable model because of how well it works. It should be dusted off, cleaned up, and put back in your practice where it belongs.</P>
<UL>
<LI>java tool
<P>The java tool itself is based on the standard in/out model for programs. The java tool provides a bridge between a sub-platform and one of the Java Platforms. The java tool returns a result code from <CODE>Runtime.exit()</CODE>. It is useful to run the java tool in a script or batch process.</P>
<LI>javac tool
<P>The javac tool itself is based on this model, too. The compiler is called upon to perform the equivalent of a <CODE>compile( String n)</CODE> method. The object-oriented method encourages us to look at everything as if it were an object. That means that the entire compilation process can be encapsulated into the javac tool.</P>
<LI>Custom program
<P>There is nothing wrong with building custom programs in Java based on the standard in/out model. You can write an object-oriented Java application that encapsulates a complex batch process, like java and javac, and returns a result code. In fact, you should build a custom program whenever it is appropriate.</P>
<P>While custom programs may be out of style, they work. Customers need software that works. When you are building software for a customer, you should consider a custom program as an option.</P>
<LI>Custom applets
<P>There is nothing wrong with building custom applets. While custom applets may be out of style, they work. Your customer needs software that works. Applets work. In most cases, it is the browser that is defective. So, we are building a better browser.</P>
<LI>Custom servlets
<P>There is nothing wrong with building custom servlets. Servlets seem to be hot technology this week. When a servlet is appropriate, you should build a servlet that works.</P>
<P>Just like <a href="/view.php?topic=CGI&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=1995e26f93072bafb3485c5be9edf5b0">CGI</a> <wikitopic CGI /wikitopic>scripting, servlets are based on the original standard in/out model. This is hard to see because the servlet environment is needlessly complex. Arbitrary complexity is bad, very bad. It increases cost and increases the risk of bugs.</P>
</UL>
<H4>CGI scripts with Java</H4>
<P>The java tool uses the standard in/out streams. This means that you can write <a href="/view.php?topic=CGI&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=1995e26f93072bafb3485c5be9edf5b0">CGI</a> <wikitopic CGI /wikitopic>scripts in Java. For all those <a href="/view.php?topic=HTTP&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=1995e26f93072bafb3485c5be9edf5b0">HTTP</a> <wikitopic HTTP /wikitopic>servers without support for Java servlets, you can run Java applications with the java tool which output dynamic <a href="/view.php?topic=HTML&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=1995e26f93072bafb3485c5be9edf5b0">HTML</a> <wikitopic HTML /wikitopic>pages through CGI.</P>
<P>Are you concerned that Java <a href="/view.php?topic=CGI&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=1995e26f93072bafb3485c5be9edf5b0">CGI</a> <wikitopic CGI /wikitopic>is <EM>slow</EM> compared to servlets? Servlets might be more efficient on a <nolink>HTTP service that supports them. When an <nolink>HTTP service does not support servlets, servlets won't help at any speed.</P>
<H4>Clarification</H4>
<P>The standard in/out model is solid, proven, rock-solid, powerful, direct, and reliable. It is old, but not old fashioned. It has been useful for over fifty years. Who knows? It might be around for fifty more. Standard in/out won't go away entirely. Like the command line, it may be tempered by fashion.</P><BR><BR></P><!--
