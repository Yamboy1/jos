<H4>Legend</H4>
Long, long ago in a township far away, the Java technologies were born. A father of these technologies, Mr. James Gosling, worked night and day to bring them to life. They were full of things admirable and worthy. But there was trouble in that township far way. The townsfolk had limited vocabulary. They had a limited way of thinking. They were infatuated with the name "Java" so much that they named everything the same. Their new abstract machine was called "Java". Their new standard class libraries was called "Java". Their new programming language was called "Java". Their tool to launch a program was also called "Java". Thus, it was difficult for the townsfolk to speak to one another about what was good and what was bad. It was difficult for us to speak about what we liked and what we disliked. This was the beginning of an age of disillusionment and confusion. And thus, darkness spread across the land.
</P><P>
Many admirable and worthy wonders were brought to life by the father of Java technologies. News of these wonders spread to Josville, our little town. Along with the wonders came the darkness and confusion. We took it upon ourselves to do what we could to correct our way of thinking. When we could, we called their new abstract machine an "abstract machine". We called their new standard class library a "standard class library". On the other hand, our way of thinking never returned to the township far away. None of us made the journey to the township far way in order to deliver our better way of thinking.
</P><P>
We wanted to give birth to something bigger. We wanted to examine the wonders of Java technologies in a new light. What if an operating system were fully optimized to run Java programs and nothing but Java programs? Such a thing would be wonderous indeed. It might be possible to do things which have never been done before. It might be possible to make things easier on the people who use software from day to day in our little town.
</P><P>
But there was trouble in our town. The puzzle proved to be more difficult than our neighbors had imagined. The task at hand would take a lot longer than anticipated. Our neighbors turned their attention to the necessary things of a town, such as building roads and bridges, building homes and offices so that one day a noble operating system might be developed for all people.
</P><P>
The puzzle was difficult. Some of our neighbors were overwhelmed by the challenge. Although desire was plentiful, skill was scarce. It was never agreed among our neighbors what should be built first. It was never agreed among our neighbors what might be the conditions for joining the order of the <nolink>JOS knights. King Author was hopeful that the knights would get along famously and figure out by themselves how to work together. Much was lost.
</P><P>
Along came a historian. This historian wanted to recover all of the lost artifacts. "Before we build anew, we must preserve," he declared. There were many advisors. There were many naysayers. There was mischief and mallace. There were heated arguments among knights over nothing. Much discussion was based upon wishful thinking, not upon what people could do.
</P><P>
There were times when the knights could not find each other in the darkness and gloom. Our first bridge washed away in a storm. The town crier grew deathly sick with illness and could no longer speak. The knights depended on the town crier to find each others. Without a crier, they did not know what to do.
</P><P>
Our town's banker, Mr. C. V. System, became sick and died. There would be no more service in the town of Josville. Our knights would have to go to the city to store their gold. Some of the <nolink>JOS knights got bored and went off alone to distant cities, never to be heard from again. The town was abandoned. While there may be precious gems deep within our mines, it takes a lot of work to find them. All of the easy mining has been done.
</P><P>
Our mines are creepy. They are disorganized and unmapped. Some knights have gone deep into the mines, never to be heard from again. It is all too easy to get lost and afraid. As miners, we can't agree where to dig. As prospectors, we can't agree where to stake our claims. We can gather gold and gems from the outskirts of town. We have picks and shovels, but no heavy-duty mining equipment.
</P><P>
We have an empty town hall. We have a forum where no one speaks. When some find their first gem, they take it for themselves and retire, never to be heard from again. None of the knights want to volunteer as guides to their neighbors. But there is gold in them there hills!
</P><P>
And then one prospector set up his own shop and calls it <nolink>DevZone. All of the other neighbors were mystified, wondering about what this name could mean. Could it be the start of something good? We can't see what is being done. We can only hear that he works night and day inside his shop. With the clink of a pick axe and swoosh of a shovel, it sounds like someone might be digging for precious gems. Meanwhile, the name remains a mystery.
