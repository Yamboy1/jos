<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>I want good programmers to work together on a new operating system. I was reminded again about some of the reasons why I want a new operating system. This article contains a few general points about the positive impact of open-source development on a modern operating system. I'll throw my passion into it and identify a popular myth about file extensions.</P>
<P>I am tired of using a stupid operating system. I have used it long enough. These features haven't worked for the last five years. Upgrades from a closed door project don't help. An open door project might be the cure.</P>
<H4>Open doors</H4>
<P>The number of people using an operating system has reached a kind of <EM>critical mass</EM> where people have experience to share. A modern operating system must be built out in the open. An open door project enables all kinds of people to share their real-world experience. It is an opportunity to fix the operating system wherever it is broken.</P>
<P>On the other hand, an operating system that is built behind closed doors will never be appropriate to the work we do in the real world. The classic single-vendor laboratory has stagnated for the last decade. It builds an operating system that nobody wants. It builds an operating system that's dead on arrival. It is inappropriate for work in the real world.</P>
<H4>People</H4>
<P>Software development is an artform. It is innovative. It is creative. It is unpredictable. Like other artforms, it is filled with passion, hope and emotional satisfaction.</P>
<P>As an artifact, software reflects the people who developed it. It reflects people. It reflects their attitudes. It reflects their beliefs. It reflects all they have been exposed to.</P>
<P>In an open door project, programmers are more likely to reflect reality. They are exposed to the real-world experience of many people. Programmers find out quickly why their software can't be used. They have an opportunity to fix it. The community grows in its understanding about itself and what other people think. They might have insight into why people think the way they do.</P>
<P>In a closed door project, programmers are more likely to reflect their laboratory. They are sheltered from real-world experience. They might passionately build software that is 100% inappropriate in the real world. The community does not grow in its understanding of itself or its customers. Such programmers never find out why their software can't be used.</P>
<H4>About file extensions</H4>
<P>I want a new OS. I want a new OS that enables me to lock entries in my mime table. When I lock in a relationship between .ini, .conf, .txt, .properties and .java and Notepad, no installation program should be allowed to undo my decision. When I lock in a relationship between .html and Netscape Navigator, no installation program should be allowed to undo my decision. When I lock in a relationship between .zip and .jar and <nolink>WinZip, no installation program should be allowed to undo my decision.</P>
<P><EM>Isn't this a breach of security?</EM></P>
<P>I want a new OS. I want informed programmers to work on an OS. The operating system I now use was written by programmers who are loyal to a single vendor. They don't work in the real world. They think I only have one browser, one <a href="/view.php?topic=IDE&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=a2d189421d93ffc75b73a793dcc3e47c">IDE</a> <wikitopic IDE /wikitopic>or one <a href="/view.php?topic=JDK&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=a2d189421d93ffc75b73a793dcc3e47c">JDK</a> <wikitopic JDK /wikitopic>because they do. But, I don't. I'm not like them.</P>
<P>I want a new OS. My ultra-conservative corporate customers want a new OS. My customers want all of the vendors to get along so that they can continue to use one of each.</P>
<H4>Mistaken and wrong</H4>
<P>I want a new OS. I strongly dislike the one I have. I want an new OS because of my old operating system's mistaken assumption about file extensions. A file extension is only a hint. It suggests what kind of file is stored and how it is used. I can name a file anything I want. My operating system gets it <STRONG>wrong</STRONG> more often than not.</P>
<P>A .java file is a text file. When I open a .java file, I want to view it quickly in a primative text editor. I do not want to launch the most recently installed integrated development environment (or IDE). An <a href="/view.php?topic=IDE&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=a2d189421d93ffc75b73a793dcc3e47c">IDE</a> <wikitopic IDE /wikitopic>takes a very long time to load. The result is usually most inappropriate. Some programmer mistakenly thinks that I only have one Java-related IDE. Give me a break. I have one of each.</P>
<P>An .html file is a text file. When I open an .html file, I want to view it quickly in my Netscape Navigator browser. I do not want to view it in the most recently installed browser. Some programmer mistakenly thinks that I have only one browser. Give me a break. I have one of each.</P>
<P>I'm not sure why other programmers think the way they do. A .jar file is a .zip file. A zip file is still a zip file regardless of its file extension. When I open a .jar file, I only want to see what's inside. I want to view it quickly in an archive browser, like <nolink>WinZip or <nolink>NetZip. I absolutely positively do not want my operating system to launch a java tool. I do not want to launch the most recently installed <a href="/view.php?topic=JDK&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=a2d189421d93ffc75b73a793dcc3e47c">JDK</a> <wikitopic JDK /wikitopic>or JRE. Some programmer mistakenly thinks that I only have one <a href="/view.php?topic=JDK&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=a2d189421d93ffc75b73a793dcc3e47c">JDK</a> <wikitopic JDK /wikitopic>or JRE. Give me a break. I have one of each.</P>
<P>A text file used for configuration is still a text file regardless of its file extension. Files that ends with .txt, .conf, .ini, .inf and .properties are all the same thing. They should be treated the same way. That pushes us toward platform-independence.</P>
<H4>Opening a closed project</H4>
<P>A trustworthy project will be successful. Experience has shown that people share their real-world experience with someone they trust. They help programmers see how software fits into the real world. The support of a community is earned through good-will over the long haul. A project must be trustworthy.</P>
<P><EM>If a commercial vendor releases its operating system as an open source project, would that solve the problem?</EM></P>
<P>In general, it cannot solve the problem. For good reason, some people have learned to distrust a closed door project. It is difficult to open an closed door project. It has a lot of legacy baggage. It has a lot of code that does not reflect an open door policy.</P>
<P>For good reason, some people have learned to distrust commercial vendors. It is difficult to open a commercial project. A commercial project hires more people motivated by money. It is formed for economic reasons, not for the kind of reasons people join an open project. Self-selection in a commercial project is skewed away from high quality software. When people did not believe in an open door policy before, the transition can be hazzardous. A commercial vendor can't develop a high quality product without the support of the team or its the community.</P>
<P>I worked for a software company that won't open its Java-related projects. I have failed to convince them. After eighteen months, I have given up all hope. It's a people problem, not a technical one. They rest comfortably in the total control of a secret laboratory. They use the laboratory like a fort to keep reality outside. They like its safety. They do not want to open the door to go outside. They are not yet up to the challenge of the real world.</P>
<H4>Summary</H4>
<P>I really want an operating system I can use. I have never given up hope that we can build one. From my viewpoint, I have every reason to be enthusiastic. Look how our machine code is about to merge with the bytecode. These are developed in parallel. Machine code is written assembler and C/C++. Bytecode is written in the Java programming language.</P>
<P>Let me borrow a little from <EM>Cathedral and Bazzaar</EM>. An open project has high use value. People can use the software to get their work done. A closed project has high sale value. People pay a lot of money to take it for a test drive. People are willing to pay a lot of money because all of its features are secret. Ultimately, closed software sits on a shelf. It cannot be used. It is inappropriate for real work. The weight of software support becomes too great for one vendor working alone.</P>
<P>I want an new OS. Don't you?</P><BR><BR></P><!--
