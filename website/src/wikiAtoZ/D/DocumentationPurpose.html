<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>So, you have the best product in the world and you'd like to document it. You might not know where to start. What needs to be documented? Are the rules different for documenting an open-source project? You should ask yourself this question:
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>What is the purpose of documentation?</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The purpose of documentation is to build trust in a product and its developer. It explains how the product is used, how to get the most value out of it's features. It helps a consumer compare and contrast different products.</P>
<H4>Multi-purpose</H4>
<P>Documentation is multi-purpose. There isn't simply one purpose to all the documentation you might write. In this article, the purpose of documentation starts out small and grows progressively toward a wider audience.</P>
<H4>Personal</H4>
<P>Once upon a time, I wrote myself a program to get facts about any <a href="/view.php?topic=SQL&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=e70a7c823b63786e582792d07d22a6d4">SQL</a> <wikitopic SQL /wikitopic>service. It is a powerful program. It is for occasional use only. I am the only one who uses it. I wrote down a half dozen examples of its most useful options. Is the program fully documented? No. Is the documentation good enough? Yes. I am the only one allowed to use it and I can.</P>
<P>The first kind of documentation is very personal. If you wrote a program, keep a journal of what the program is supposed to do. When you get an idea, keep it in your journal. Your intended audience in this case is you and only you. A journal is not intended for anyone else.</P>
<P>A journal enables you to keep notes on all projects in one place. I write phone numbers, e-mail addresses, websites into my journal. My journal is a non-digital, spiral-bound, college-ruled notebook. I can take it anywhere. A non-digital notebook never needs recharging. I can use it whenever I want, including take-off and landing in an airplane. I can't get pages out of order because it is spiral-bound. I can write a lot of notes because it is large and college-ruled. Since every idea sounds like a good idea at first, I use my journal to focus on ideas with the greatest chance of success.</P>
<P>A journal is a kind of engineering notebook. It includes everything about my day-to-day activity. It is volitile and chaotic because it includes everything, without being sensored.</P>
<H4>Correspondence</H4>
<P>Widing the circle a little from a personal journal, correspondence is another kind of documentation. Correspondence enables you to share your ideas with another. Any idea you wish to share can be documented well-enough with correspondence. Always keep a copy of what you send. In this case, the intended audience is an individual.</P>
<P>Person-to-person electronic mail (e-mail) is a popular kind of correspondence. It breaks the time-honored rules of space and time. Throught Internet-based e-mail, documentation arrives with immediacy and urgency.</P>
<P>When writing a program for one other person to use, a less formal mechanism can be useful: document by correspondence. Instead of anticipating the kinds of questions one other person might have, wait until they ask you. It is a more efficient use of your time to make a program that works than write a long-winded essay, covering parts of the program nobody wants to know.</P>
<H4>Forum</H4>
<P>Widing the circle more from correspondence, a forum is another kind of documentation. A forum enables you to share your ideas with a group. Any idea you wish to share with anyone in the group can be documented well-enough with a forum. A forum keeps a copy of what everyone contributes. In this case, your intended audience is many individuals, members of a group. An individual must join or subscribe to become a member of the forum.</P>
<P>A mailing list is a popular kind of forum. An Internet-based mailing list might provide a forum for any group, any topic of conversation.</P>
<P>When writing a program for a group to use, a less formal mechanism can be useful: document by mailing list. Document the core part of a program. The core part of a program is the part every member of the group can use. It is a more efficient use of the group's time when you document the core and wait until another question is asked.</P>
<H4>Broadcast</H4>
<P>Widing the circle more from a forum, broadcast is another kind of documentation. Broadcast is for non-members. There is nothing to join. Broadcast has the largest intended audience: the public.</P>
<P>Besides books, radio, television and CD, an Internet website is a good example of broadcast documentation. When using broadcast, document both core and fringe parts of a program. It might be your only opportunity to provide your customers with the documentation they need.</P>
<P>Typically, broadcast documentation might not provide a clear and simple path for feedback. While broadcasting it is difficult to listen.</P>
<H4>What to document</H4>
<P>A product, like software, is intended to be used. The first priority is documentating how to use a product. If you build a multi-feature product, document the most frequently used feature first.</P>
<P>Prioritize. It is neither necessary nor adventageous to document the whole product at once. The process of documentation changes the way you think about a product. You learn more about the product by writing its documentation.</P>
<P>If your product requires installation and configuration, you might want to document it. While it might be the first thing a customer must use, remember that installation and configuration is not a day-to-day use of the product (is it?).</P>
<P>If you expect your product to be used by other programmers, document the most frequently used features first. Provide others with examples of using a feature in an example method or full program.</P>
<P>And then, it gets weird. Just as others do not know what your program can do for them, they do not know what documentation you have provided. As you make documentation available, keep a cross-reference so that others can find out about the things you've had time to document.</P>
<P>It gets more weird. If your product has been improved, you now have two audiences:</P>
<UL>
<LI>those who have already used the old product and read the old documentation; and
<LI>those who are using your product for the first time and reading the documentation for the first time.
</UL>
<H4>Decision</H4>
<P>As an author, decide how much documentation you want to write. Divide your time in to developing software worth documenting and documentation that makes it worthwhile to develop software. Good documentation builds trust in a product.</P>
<P>If you develop the best product and keep its use a secret, you might be the only one capable of using your product. The world will never know that you have developed the best product.</P>
<P>If you write the best documentation for a stupid product, everyone will be capable of using your product; but, they might not want to. Throughout the history of the software industry, stupid software with great documentation is the most popular. People demand to know how to use a product. They want to know all about it.</P>
<H4>Product evaluation</H4>
<P>Consumers expect the claims in documentation to be true and accurate. They are reassured by legal protections against false claims (truth in advertising). Using only the documentation as a guide, consumers compare and contrast the feature of two products and decide which one they can adopt. Many consumers cannot afford to purchase a for-fee software license for every product ever developed. While people might need one of each, they are limited by what they can afford.</P>
<P>Many consumers do not have time to learn how to use every product ever developed. While they might need to know more about the products on the marketplace, they are limited by time. It takes time to learn how a product works.</P>
<P>Good documentation is a thoughtful gesture on the part of a developer. It is intended to shorten the time to evaluate a product. It is also intended to shorten to learn a product in more detail so that it can be used efficiently. It is a gift from developer to consumer to save the consumer's time. A consumer has more time left over to get their work done.</P>
<P>Bad documentation is an insult to the consumer. It lengthens the time to evaluate and learn a product. It can waste a consumers time, especially when a consumer buys the wrong product for their work. Bad documentation means a consumer has less time to get their work done.</P>
<P>Good documentation is honest about the current features of a product. If a feature isn't finished yet, good documentation explains precisely what is and isn't finished.</P>
<P>Bad documentation comes from a developer's inability to describe a product from the consumer's point of view. It is difficult for some to switch roles from coder to writer. A writer must step away from the product and see it as others see it.</P>
<P>Consumer beware. An evaluation process is risky at best if it depends exclusively on vendor-provided documentation. Developers are capable of dishonesty, too. The worst documentation comes from a trickster, a developer bent on deception. By making outrageous claims, a developer puts bad software in slick documentation. The software and documentation do not match. Some developers write about features on their wishlist as if they have already been written. They use past or present tense when explaining what is coming (or what might be coming) in the future. Such developers are free to advertise vaporware, well-known software that doesn't exist yet.</P>
<TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1">
<TR>
<TD>
<P><STRONG>Sidebar:</STRONG> Why am I so disappointed in the software industry? Because some developers perpetuate claims and products that do not match.</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>Commercial vendors are under tremendous pressure to sell poor quality software to maximize their profits. As long as outrageous claims seem work in the short term, commercial vendors use them.</P>
<P>Free-license software has zero pressure to maximize their profits. The goal of free-license software is to maximize product benefits. Whatever time is required to build high quality software, free-license software always costs the same.</P>
<LI><P>Outrageous claims do not work for open-source software. If you provide the source code to your product, everyone can plainly see for themselves how the features are implemented. A commercial vendor must keep their source code secret in order to make outrageous claims with impunity (without getting into legal trouble). Without source code, it is difficult to prove a feature was never there.</P>
</UL>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<H4>Feature benefits</H4>
<P>Maximizing product benefits is another purpose of documentation. A product helps you get your work done. Documentation helps you understand your product.</P>
<P>Some features are more important to others. Features used on a daily basis are most important. Features that work reliably are more important than features that don't. The knowledge of feature benefits should be documented. Warn people away from dangerous or flakey features. This knowledge feeds into both documentation and product re-design. Undocumented features should not be exposed to your customer. If you don't have time to explain how it works, you don't have time to write it into your product.</P>
<P>The purpose of documentation is product stability. Your product must be compatible with the past and future. A product re-design should be careful to retain parts of the product people enjoy. Documentation provides a history of your product and its past features.</P>
<H4>Open source</H4>
<P>Open source software requires a little different approach to documentation. For example, open source encourages developers to write some documentation into the source file. What kind of documentation should go into the source?</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>Documentation for other programmers to use the unmodified code in another product. In an object-oriented language, use of unmodified code includes implementing an interface and extending a class.</P>
<LI><P>Documentation for another programmer to take over the maintenance of the code. It is not necessary for the original author to stay with a product throughout its life. Product management can be passed from one programmer to the next.</P>
</UL>
<P>Good documentation of open source software makes many references to the source code itself. It provides more information about where you can find the source code on the web. An online document might provide links to the source code.</P>
<P>Typically, technical documentation includes source code examples to help explain and illustrate the use of an <a href="/view.php?topic=API&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=e70a7c823b63786e582792d07d22a6d4">API</a> <wikitopic API /wikitopic>or framework. When the original is open source, source code examples should be open source. Sometimes an example is a fully functional program. It might be useful as a product in its own right. Jasmin, for example, was written to illustrate the use of the <nolink>JAS framework.</P>
<P>Explaining how to use a framework to build an application is one purpose of technical documentation. The documentation provides a reference of each function in a framework. The cross-references are important in a framework, so see the framework from different viewpoints.</P>
<P>When working in the Java programming language, the documentation written into source code can be extracted with <nolink>JavaDoc. <nolink>JavaDoc was created with secret source in mind. It is not a perfect solution for open source projects. It shows how the role of the programming staff includes documentation.</P>
<H4>When</H4>
<P>Some programmers agree on the purpose of documentation, but disagree on when documentation should be written.</P>
<UL>
<LI><P><STRONG>Documentation first</STRONG></P>
<P>In some organizations, analysts write the documentation to describe the way the software will work (someday). If everything succeeds, the documentation is passed on to the developers to write the software and the consumer who uses the software. If something fails, the documentation and software don't match when delivered to the customer.</P>
<P>In theory, an expert should be able to make strategic decisions about how the software will work before the first line is coded. In theory, copies of the documentation are given to a large programming team. Everybody sees how the program should work. Lots of people can work on the product in parallel. There are no problems integrating the product just before it is delivered to the customer.</P>
<LI><P><STRONG>Documentation last</STRONG></P>
<P>In some organizations, programmers write software first. Through experimentation (trial and error), a programmer settles on a design that works. The program is passed off to other people (testers) to use. At the last moment, the software is passed off to a documentation team to describe how the software actually works.</P>
<LI><P><STRONG>Continuous documentation</STRONG>
<P>Some organizations try to keep the documentation and the software synchronized. Documentation lags behind or gets ahead. Documentation is continuous, used throughout the development project. As the software is maintained, the documentation is maintained. The documentation is published frequently throughout the project so that everyone shares a common viewpoint.</P>
<P>A large group of programmers cannot be thrown at the product in the beginning of the project because the product hasn't been designed yet. Rather, programming staff is added as needed to get the work done.</P>
<P>With the availability of better tools (like the web), organizations have been able to reduce the overhead often associated with continuous documentation. Rather than printing the latest product description on paper, pages are updated on a website. With the software itself available through <a href="/view.php?topic=FTP&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=e70a7c823b63786e582792d07d22a6d4">FTP</a> <wikitopic FTP /wikitopic>or HTTP, better tools make it possible to develop a product in public. A product developed in public is often a higher quality product.</P>
</UL>
<H4>Remember</H4>
<P>Documentation is history. Documentation helps you remember what it was like at the time. Without the documentation, you might not be able to see the opening screen of an obsolete piece of equipment. In the quest to build a better operating system, find out how other operating systems were built. Gather copies of the documentation you can afford.</P>
<P>A person trusts a product they understand. They understand a product by using it. Good documentation helps a person use the product. Documentation exposes a person to the features of the software that should work. With frequent use, a product becomes known. A person knows what works and what doesn't. An expert can make their own documentation and make corrections to yours.</P>
<H4>Summary</H4>
<P>What is the purpose of documentation? The purpose of documentation is to help people. Help yourself and others. Practice writing like you practice coding. Write down your favorite things about each program you write.</P><BR><BR></P><!--
