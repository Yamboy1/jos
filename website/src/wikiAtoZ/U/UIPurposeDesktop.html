<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>So, you have grown quite fond of your desktop. Have you ever wondered about what a desktop is supposed to do for you? What is the purpose of a desktop?
<H4>Association</H4>
<P>A desktop provides easy access to specific tools you need to do your work. You may do many kinds of work. At the high level, a desktop is closely associated with each kind of work.</P>
<P>A desktop presents a small subset of all possible tools. A desktop is supplements a command line. The desktop provides easy access to a few command lines. When you need to use the same commands frequently, a desktop is a solution. Inside your desktop's configuration, an association between a short alias and a long and complex command line makes it possible to use alias as if it were a command.<P>
<P>An iconic desktop represents each command line with an icon. It provides a way to use an icon to run its command. A caption desktop represents each command line with a caption. It provides a way to use a caption to run its command. A combination desktop uses an icon, a caption, or both.</P>
<P>An iconic desktop is not the only kind of desktop. In fact, you might not recognize an <a href="/view.php?topic=HTML&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=f631c9bcf6f977eed3fff25a8f98b867">HTML</a> <wikitopic HTML /wikitopic>page with links as a desktop even though it serves exactly the same purpose. Inside an <nolink>HTML page, an association between descriptive plain text and a long and complex <nolink>URL makes it possible to use the descriptive text to run its <nolink>URL.</P>
<H4>Multiple desktops</H4>
<P>When you're working with personal and business applications, multiple, concurrent projects, or transitioning from one job to another, you need multiple desktops. Multiple desktops are a good idea. In practice, everyone feels the need for multiple desktops eventually. A modern operating system should support a consistent model for multiple, independent desktops. Most operating systems support multiple desktops. Only an arrogant OS acts as if it's desktop is the best one.</P>
<P>Desktop configuration does not have to be stored locally; it can be stored across the network. It should be stored through a consistent <nolink>API, like the registry <nolink>API. A single, reusable desktop package could support a wide variety of desktops through desktop configuration alone. A smart desktop could support an infinite variety through a combination of desktop configuration and a smart object factory. The run-time selection of components on the desktop itself should be determined by desktop configuration.</P>
<P>A desktop configuration perfectly suited for Swing can run without modification on AWT. The configuration is an abstract view of the runtime environment of a desktop.</P>
<H4>Links</H4>
<P>To highlight the association, or link, between an alias and its command, an alias is sometimes call a link. Each link contains the full text of a command line. When you run a link, it runs its command.</P>
<H4>Shortcuts</H4>
<P>To emphasize how much easier it is to use an alias for a command, an alias is sometimes called a shortcut. Each shortcut is displayed, with icon and caption, on a desktop. For a self-contained desktop configuration, a shortcut's configuration is stored inside the configuration of its desktop.</P>
<H4>Search path</H4>
<P>The classic shell provides an alias for frequently used command lines. A shell may be supported by a <EM>search path</EM> so you can type less and get the same result. Links, shortcuts and commands can be found (and run) through a search path.</P>
<H4>Parameters</H4>
<P>When you use command line parameters with an alias, an alias might ignore them or pass them on. When an alias passes parameters on, it may be inserted at a specific point or appended to the end of the new command line.</P>
<H4>Self-reference</H4>
<P>An alias might accidentally point to itself. An operating system should detect such a self-reference. Otherwise, the alias might result in an endless loop.</P>
<H4>Chaining</H4>
<P>When an alias has a command that points to another alias, this is called chaining. Chaining may be used to create the <EM>default</EM> tool under a generic alias. You may have an alias called "browser" that always starts your favorite browser whatever that happens to be this week.</P>
<H4>Bookmark</H4>
<P>The bookmark (and favorites) mechanism is yet another form of desktop. It associates a relatively short name (the bookmark) for a relatively long and complicated <nolink>URL.
<H4>Scripting</H4>
<P>A new tool can be created by running a series of other tools. This is called scripting. You use the name of a script (or batch file) on the command line to run a its series of commands.</P>
<H4>Defect</H4>
<P>A desktop hides the complexity of the command line. While a new user should be able to start applications with 10 seconds of training, or less, an experienced user need to know more about the way their desktop works.</P>
<P>Many iconic desktops have the same defect. While a desktop is supposed to hide the complexity of the command line, many desktops hide the complexity all too well. A user with years of experience may not know the first thing about how to backup/restore their own data, how to set up an alias, how to get an alias to work when it's broken. A overly simplistic desktop forces a user to remain a novice, dependent on other people to do simple tasks.</P>
<P>Some desktops have difficulty with scripting. While shortcuts associate one alias for one command, scripting must associate one alias for many commands. Scripts are difficult to configure with a simplistic fill-in the blank approach. As a practical matter, you must know the full text of each command.</P>
<P>I build shortcuts on behalf of other people. I should be able to configure an shortcut for another machine. A shortcut editor should not assume that the shortcut is going to be used exclusively on the same machine where it was created/edited.</P>
<H4>Masterpiece</H4>
<P>A good desktop is an entry-level interface to the machine. A great desktop is a stepping stone to the power of the command line. The desktop should display the selected command line on the screen. You should see the command you're about to run. That is why an <nolink>HTML browser also makes a great desktop. It puts the <nolink>URL for each page in the location field, just in case you're interested.</P>
<H4>Command line</H4>
<P>A command line is open-ended. It works with all of the tools on your machine. A command line is useful when you have thousands or tens of thousands of different things you can do. An Internet browser should uses a command line because there are hundreds of thousands of <nolink>HTML on the World Wide Web.</P>
<P>A command line is immediate. You type in a command. You do not configure anything to try something new. It is an important tool for running the tools you need infrequently.</P>
<H4>Desktop</H4>
<P>A desktop depends on a command line. A desktop cannot work with the full set of all possible commands. A desktop can become impossibly cluttered with obsolete and infrequently used icons. A desktop is supposed to make a command easy to find. What's the point of a desktop if you have to search for the one icon you need among hundreds of others? Too many icons defeats the purpose of a desktop.</P>
<H4>About <nolink>JOS</H4>
<P>When dealing with the complex issues of a desktop for JOS, keep in mind that a desktop is always built on top of a command line. When a command line stops working, a desktop stops working too. The desktop itself is a very simple program. It has to read and write a desktop configuration, display icons and/or captions, and dispatch all commands to the command line tool. The desktop itself does not run commands.</P><BR><BR></P><!--
