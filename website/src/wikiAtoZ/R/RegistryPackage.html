<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>Sometimes you might need permission to do the right thing. You have all of our permission to build experimental <nolink>APIs using the right naming convention. What is the right nameing convention? You must mind your own packages. You must put your packages in your own namespace, neither in <nolink>jos nor <nolink>org.jos.</P>
<P>We must build on strength. A large namespace is one of the most important strengths of Java. We must take advantage of the large namespace as we develop <a href="/view.php?topic=JOS&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=bbb5e6f16dcbcea9a88f1b9da27c7a10">JOS</a> <wikitopic JOS /wikitopic>over the long haul.</P>
<P>We must think big. When Sun Microsystems finds out about the <a href="/view.php?topic=JOS&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=bbb5e6f16dcbcea9a88f1b9da27c7a10">JOS</a> <wikitopic JOS /wikitopic>registry, they will build a registry <nolink>API, too. In an open project, you expect others to use our best ideas. Hopefully, they won't take our worst ideas. And neither should we.</P>
<P>In many Java projects today, development process is exactly backward. The default development process encourages us to keep the worst and throw away the best. That's not healthy. That's not what we want. We need to think about this. Sun Microsystems defined this development process. It doesn't work for them, so why should we use it?</P>
<H4>Naming convention</H4>
<P>We should find a naming convention that works for everyone. The current naming convention only works for a few. We should think big. Everyone that volunteers their time to refine and promote <a href="/view.php?topic=JOS&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=bbb5e6f16dcbcea9a88f1b9da27c7a10">JOS</a> <wikitopic JOS /wikitopic>and Java should have their own space.</P>
<P>We can get along better by choosing a fair naming convention. The current <a href="/view.php?topic=JOS&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=bbb5e6f16dcbcea9a88f1b9da27c7a10">JOS</a> <wikitopic JOS /wikitopic>naming convention is not fair to either the individual or the community. The recommended process is broken. It doesn't work. It can't work. Why? Because the first person to lay claim on an official package wins at the expense of everyone else. That is not how a mature <nolink>API is developed. For more information on a mature API, see also <a href="/view.php?topic=MatureAPI&PHPSESSID=bbb5e6f16dcbcea9a88f1b9da27c7a10">MatureAPI</a><wikitopic MatureAPI /wikitopic>.
<P>It is unfair to the individual for a number of reasons. An individual must be able to challenge a proposal at any time. An individual must be able to create a counter-proposal. An individual should be able to use a candidate standard if they choose to. An individual should be aware of the risks and trade-offs. An individual should not have to wait, keeping all their projects on hold, until a candidate standard becomes an official standard. Using a candidate standard is how the Internet was made. In fact, standards must be implemented before they can be pushed through the standardization process.</P>
<P>It is unfair to the community for a number of reasons. A community must benefit from its best ideas. We must be able to pick the best-of-breed among <nolink>APIs and implementations. We should not pick the first idea. We should not suffer under the weight of a first draft <nolink>API. A first draft <nolink>API is rarely the last word on a subject. A community must have a choice among many different <nolink>APIs. A community that undermines competition will always suffers from mediocrity. Maximize the discussion of different perspectives.</P>
<P>The best <nolink>API today surely won't be the best <nolink>API tomorrow. A community that promotes the best of the best will be prosperous and thrive. A community that embraces mediocrity will die.</P>
<P>The <a href="/view.php?topic=JOS&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=bbb5e6f16dcbcea9a88f1b9da27c7a10">JOS</a> <wikitopic JOS /wikitopic>naming convention doesn't have to be fair. We could choose to mangle the <a href="/view.php?topic=JOS&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=bbb5e6f16dcbcea9a88f1b9da27c7a10">JOS</a> <wikitopic JOS /wikitopic>namespace in the same way other operating systems do. Namespace is one of the reasons why I don't like other operating systems. The Microsoft Windows namespace for DLLs only works if you work at Microsoft. The Java namespace only works if you work at Sun Microsystems.</P>
<H4>Important lesson</H4>
<P>This issue was raised with the development of multiple (and currently incompatible) registries. There must be multiple implementations of both the registry <nolink>API and registry-related classes.</P>
<P>We should learn this lesson early in the development of the <a href="/view.php?topic=JOS&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=bbb5e6f16dcbcea9a88f1b9da27c7a10">JOS</a> <wikitopic JOS /wikitopic><nolink>API and its related packages. We can learn the lesson now when it is less expensive, or wait to learn it down the road. It gets more expensive every day that goes by.</P>
<H4>How it should work</H4>
<P>First, here is the reality. I have a registry package. You have a registry package. Three more people each quarter will have their registry package. When Sun Microsystems figures out that a registry package is a good idea (and it is), they will build a registry package in their java.* hiearchy somewhere.</P>
<P>In order to support diversity, each registry <nolink>API should be named for what it really is: a proposal.
<UL>
<LI>My registry <nolink>API should be called <CODE>com.realignsoft.registry1a</CODE> because that's what it is. It is one of many different registry <nolink>APIs that I'm planning.
<LI>Your registry <nolink>API should be called <EM>your-name-here</EM>.registry.. because that's what it is. It is one of many registry proposals you are planning.
<LI>Sun Microsystems registry <nolink>API should be called <CODE>com.sun.registry..</CODE> because that's what it is.
<LI>If <a href="/view.php?topic=IBM&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=bbb5e6f16dcbcea9a88f1b9da27c7a10">IBM</a> <wikitopic IBM /wikitopic>wants to propose a registry <nolink>API, they should call it <CODE>com.ibm.registry..</CODE>
</UL>
<H4>Immediate benefit</H4>
<P>When a registry <nolink>API is named properly, there are many benefits. You can develop real tests. You can run the code. You can compare different registry <nolink>APIs side by side within one JVM. You can get your hands on it. And if you are bold, you can use the leading edge registry <nolink>API in your own production code long before the dust settles on which registry <nolink>API is the "best", which registry <nolink>API is good enough to be the official <a href="/view.php?topic=JOS&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=bbb5e6f16dcbcea9a88f1b9da27c7a10">JOS</a> <wikitopic JOS /wikitopic>registry <nolink>API.</P>
<H4>Sequence</H4>
<P>In the proper light, every <a href="/view.php?topic=JOS&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=bbb5e6f16dcbcea9a88f1b9da27c7a10">JOS</a> <wikitopic JOS /wikitopic><nolink>API is a proposal. Proposals should follow the sequence that makes the Internet great. An author publishes a request for comments (RFC). The proposal is put together in a draft specification and reference implementation, using the proposal names.</P>
<P>After the proposed <nolink>API has been used by <a href="/view.php?topic=JOS&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=bbb5e6f16dcbcea9a88f1b9da27c7a10">JOS</a> <wikitopic JOS /wikitopic>programmers, they might be qualified to respond to an RFC. There will always be things that they like about the <nolink>API and things they don't. Every <a href="/view.php?topic=JOS&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=bbb5e6f16dcbcea9a88f1b9da27c7a10">JOS</a> <wikitopic JOS /wikitopic>programmer should be free to say what they like and don't like, as well as put together their own counter-proposal.</P>
<P>A proposed <nolink>API must never occupy the space of an official package. The first proposed registry <nolink>API should definitely not go in the <a href="/view.php?topic=org.jos.registry&PHPSESSID=bbb5e6f16dcbcea9a88f1b9da27c7a10">org.jos.registry</a><wikitopic org.jos.registry /wikitopic> space. The first proposed <nolink>API doesn't offer all of the benefits of a mature <nolink>API. How can a proposed registry <nolink>API occupy the space for the official registry <nolink>API?</P>
<P>JOS programmers should compete for the most mature <nolink>API for JOS. <a href="/view.php?topic=JOS&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=bbb5e6f16dcbcea9a88f1b9da27c7a10">JOS</a> <wikitopic JOS /wikitopic>will be better for it. We must use competition to push the technology forward. By this mechanism, all of us get everything we want.</P>
<H4>About implementations</H4>
<P>The implementations of classes in an <nolink>API should be open for all. That is the point of an application programming interface, after all, for application programmers to write their own implementations the interface.</P>
<P>In order to support diversity, each registry package should be named for what it really is: a unique implementation.
<UL>
<LI>My favorite self-describing-binary-file-based registry package is called <CODE>com.realignsoft.masterregistry1a</CODE> because that's what it is. It is one of many different registry implementations that I'm planning.
<LI>Your registry implementation should be called <EM>your-name-here</EM>.<EM>your-product-name-here</EM>.. because that's what it is. It is one of many registry implementations you're planning.
<LI>Sun Microsystems registry implementation should be called <CODE>com.sun.<EM>custom</EM>registry..</CODE> because that's what it is.
<LI>If <a href="/view.php?topic=IBM&web=Imported&PHPSESSID=bbb5e6f16dcbcea9a88f1b9da27c7a10">IBM</a> <wikitopic IBM /wikitopic>wants to build a registry implementation, they should call it <CODE>com.ibm.<EM>custom</EM>registry..</CODE>
</UL>
<H4>Future</H4>
<P>The future is bright. A bridge should be planned between different registry <nolink>APIs. Just as we have seen the strength of the JDBC-ODBC bridge, we can look forward to a bridge between <CODE>org.jos.registry</CODE> and <CODE>java.lang.registry</CODE>. When a bridge implementation is contructed between two competing <nolink>APIs, everybody wins. All of the implementations of two competing <nolink>APIs become instantly compatible.</P>
<P>Java is different. It has the power to get the work done now and into the future. All of the power hinges on keeping a consistent naming convention.<BR><BR></P><!--
