<I>Article contributed by <a href="/view.php?topic=GilbertHerschberger&PHPSESSID=6539fc9eaa49683822edb8e2a719d417">GilbertHerschberger</a><wikitopic GilbertHerschberger /wikitopic>.</I>
<P><nolink>When all is said and done, we all want one. Customers, suppliers, architects and programmers want one. We want an mature <nolink>API that has it all: stability, compatibility, reliability and high quality. We want an <nolink>API that we can count on, build on and make advanced applications with little effort.</P>
<P>An <a href="/view.php?topic=API&PHPSESSID=6539fc9eaa49683822edb8e2a719d417">API</a><wikitopic API /wikitopic> is an application programming interface. Like an interface in Java, an application programming interface is an interface only, not an implementation.</P>
<P>Where are we now? After designing and using so many <nolink>APIs, I thought it might be helpful to describe here how an <nolink>API matures naturally. Sometimes it helps to think about where the mature <nolink>API comes from.</P>
<P>When does it become mature? Just as a final draft is not the first step when writing, maturity is <STRONG>not step one</STRONG>. There is no way to go from zero to a mature <nolink>API in a single step. A mature <nolink>API cannot be built once, then used forever without change. The point of creating drafts is to use it, to watch it grow and see what's missing.</P>
<P>A mature <nolink>API comes from the cycle of using it, fixing it, thinking about it. A mature <nolink>API comes from growing it naturally based on experience. You shouldn't trust an <nolink>API that you have never used. It is impossible to know its strengths and weaknesses in advance. And if you never use it, it is impossible to improve it.</P>
<P>The growth of a mature <nolink>API slows over time. A useful <nolink>API grows to maturity and keeps on growing.</P>
<P>For each production class, I build a test class to push it to its limits. <a href="/view.php?topic=ExtremeProgramming&PHPSESSID=6539fc9eaa49683822edb8e2a719d417">ExtremeProgramming</a><wikitopic ExtremeProgramming /wikitopic> suggests using a class as soon as possible after it has been designed, including writing test programs. The test program provides artificial experience in the use of an <nolink>API. Under the right conditions, this experience can be translated to real world experience of application programming in the trenches. Typically, the art of writing test programs are so far away from the real world because we can forget that this experience is artificial. Test programs only work in the laboratory.</P>
<P>If you really want a mature <nolink>API, don't destroy your work. You cannot afford to destroy your work every time you get a new idea. High quality version control means creating a new namespace to work with for each new design. I said it once and I'll say it again, keeping the design that failed may be far more important than keeping the design that succeeded. The best experience comes from working through a failure so that you know exactly what went wrong and how it happened.</P>
<P>If you want a really mature <nolink>API, you must be able to run every version of the <nolink>API, side-by-side on a single machine, to compare and contrast the different designs. And for all those architects, designers and programmers that follow, keeping every version of the <nolink>API in runnable condition allows others to see what works and what doesn't. To boost your confidence, it doesn't hurt to look at the <nolink>API you created three months ago and see how immature it was compared to what you're using now.</P>
<P>Since it is strongly recommended to use the <nolink>API early and often, you can use an <nolink>API in your application program as soon as it is functional. You should put all improvements of the <nolink>API inside a working application program, queueing improvements towards the next release of the <nolink>API sometime.</P>
<P>If you want to develop a <nolink>API to maturity, don't move all of your ideas directly to the <nolink>API. Work with your ideas in a real applications (test applications don't count) and see if the idea turns out to be as great as you originally thought.</P>
<P>If you want a mature <nolink>API, don't look backward with regret. There will always be a large hole in the <nolink>API you hadn't thought about. When you find a hole (and you will), look at it as an opportunity to design and build the next release of the <nolink>API without that hole. Don't look at it with regret, as if it were a failure. Crying about some missing feature is like crying over spilt milk. Learn from it and go forward.</P>
<P>If you want a iron-clad, top-quality, field-tested <nolink>API, you have to use it in real world applications. Using an <nolink>API is what exposes all of details on bad design and/or bad implementation. The architect and designer should use it to build applications, too.</P>
<P>Let's fast forward a little bit. If you want a backward compatible <nolink>API, you must intentionally create different versions of the <nolink>API, use them in real world applications and see what happens. The question is not "Are they backward compatible?" but "Can they be made compatible?"</P>
<P>An <nolink>API must be designed with backward compatibility in mind to <STRONG>give backward compatibility a chance</STRONG>. When designing an <nolink>API for backward compatibility, there's no guarantee that it will be compatible with your future designs. Great design keeps a window of opportunity open <I>as long as possible</I>. It improves the odds.</P>
<P>For as long as an <nolink>API continues to be theoretical rather than usable, its chance of success erodes. How can a programmer learn to appreciate an <nolink>API they can't use? How can a company standardize on an <nolink>API they can't put into their products? How can a customer use advanced applications based on an <nolink>API that's not finished yet? When the promised <nolink>API never materializes, don't be surprised when your customer's patience has worn thin.</P>
<P>There is a world of difference between a mature <nolink>API and a perfect <nolink>API. A perfect <nolink>API has no holes. It is difficult, if not impossible, to create a perfect <nolink>API. Nobody wants a perfect <nolink>API anyway. People don't want an architect to work alone in her laboratory for ten years before they get their first look at her design. A perfect <nolink>API is usually too little, too late.</P>
<P>When I build an <nolink>API, I follow my own advice. In the beginning, it was hard to tell the difference between my approach and everybody else's. It was kind of <I>if you've seen one <nolink>API, you've seen them all</I>. It becomes easier to see the difference after using the fourth release of an <nolink>API. 
<UL>
<LI><B>All of the old applications keep on running.</B> Since the old <nolink>API (interface design) is never changed after it is released, old applications continue to work predictably. Bugs are fixed, of course, under strict guidelines for side-effects and compatibility. So few software defects are simple bugs after all. Most require design changes.</P>
<LI><B>Applications are upgraded individually.</B> Applications are individually and intentionally moved from one release of the <nolink>API to the next, leap-frogging interim releases of the <nolink>API when possible. Changing the <nolink>API foundation requires a complete regression test. Who has time to do that every couple of days? I have better things to do. Applications are upgraded as demand and time allows.
<LI><B>New designs are free to innovate.</B> With an all new namespace, there is no assumption about the names of classes or methods in each new release of the <nolink>API. Having said that, a mature <nolink>API seldom needs drastic name changes.
<LI><B>There are no conflicts, like designing around depreciated methods.</B> If programmers are not supposed to use a method after all, the method is deleted completely from the new <nolink>API. No problem. If a method is supposed to return an int instead of a short, it is fixed. No problem. If a method turns out to be a really bad idea in retrospect, it is dropped. No problem.
<LI><B>There are no surprises, like unpredictable run-time errors.</B> Upgrading an application becomes an explicit business decision. The focus is shifted away from upgrading the <nolink>API to upgrading each application. That is when it is appropriate to perform regression testing on the application and fit everything into the application upgrade project's schedule. You can ask, "Do we have time for this?"
<LI><B>There are no application upgrade interdependencies.</B> Upgrading an <nolink>API just because of one application doesn't break all of the other applications. In the real world, there are many applications, developed at different times, at different releases of the <nolink>API. Everybody wants a stable <nolink>API because replacing an <nolink>API at the end of a project makes the project longer.
<LI><B>Completely backward compatible is guaranteed.</B> Backward compatibility is guaranteed by distributing every release (original and unchanged) when distributing the latest release. It sounds excessive, but, it works. Other methods may sound more reasonable, but, they don't work.
</UL>
<P>When building a new application, programmers must be free to use the most appropriate <nolink>API possible. The latest and greatest <nolink>API may not be the best <nolink>API for the job. The latest <nolink>API might be too big. The latest and greatest <nolink>API might be perfectly optimized for something else.</P>
<P>As a disaster waiting to happen, it is irresponsible to upgrade an application to the latest and greatest <nolink>API simultaneous to making a minor bug fix. It makes more sense to pick your battles. I like to pick the battles I'm going to win.
<P>It doesn't seem possible for an application programmer to get their work done and stay up-to-speed on all <nolink>APIs all the time. Making the programmer adapt to the new <nolink>API under deadline pressure might not be the best business decision.</P><BR><BR></P><!--
