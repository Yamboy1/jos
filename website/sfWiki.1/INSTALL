I.   Getting an sfWiki distribution.

	The sfWiki homepage is at http://sfwiki.sourceforge.net,
	and it has links to the distributions available for download.

	Alternatively, the sfWiki project page is at
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/sfwiki/, which also has links to CVS.

	sfWiki assumes it will be installed at SourceForge, but if you
	have a similar enough server elsewhere, it should work.

	You will need a MySQL database.  Ask SourceForge for one, if your
	project doesn't have one already; from the `project admin' link,
	select `database admin.'

	Since you'll need to use SourceForge's shell server to set the
	sfWiki up, I'd recommend using CVS from there to get the source,
	so you can keep it up to date easily and you don't have to worry
	about transferring files from your local machine to SourceForge.
	This should work:

		cd /home/groups/projectname
		cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs1:/cvsroot/sfwiki login
			<press the 'Enter' key instead of a password>
		cvs -z 3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs1:/cvsroot/sfwiki co sfWiki

	It will create a 'sfWiki' subdirectory in your project's directory,
	and I'll assume you're in it for the rest of the instructons.

II.  Configuring the sfWiki

	(1) Build the database tables:
		(A) cp ./portal/example/site.inc ./site.inc
		(B) edit ./site.inc to reflect your particular project
		(C) ./gen-table.php3
	(2) Edit the formatting:
		(A) Edit ./portal/Static*.ihtml to your liking.
		    ./portal/example/ has sfWiki's formatting in it.
		(B) Edit ./portal/Common*.ihtml to your liking.
		    ./portal/example/ has sfWiki's formatting in it.
		(C) Edit ./portal/htdocs/wiki/IndexBody.ihtml to suit.  
		    This will be displayed by index.php3, with the common
		    and static headers and footers as appropriate.
		    Alternately, mv htdocs/index.php out of the way and
		    ln -s htdocs/view.php htdocs/index.php to use 
		    a WikiPage as the introductory page.
		(D) Adjust ./portal/htdocs/wiki/success.ihtml
		    to reflect your website.
	(3) If you'd like, import the default Wiki pages, which include
	    instructions on using WikiFormatting:
		(A) cd portal
		(B) ./import.php3
	(4) Symlink sfWiki/htdocs into your htdocs directory.
	    Be sure to use link to the same place you specified as
	    `docrootdir' `in site.inc'.
	(6) copy either portal/example/sfWiki.htaccess or 
		        portal/example/root.htaccess to htdocs/.htaccess,
	    depending on what your `docrootdir' is.  (Change the RewriteBase
	    line in the .htaccess file to be your docrootdir, if necessary.)

III.  Enjoy!
