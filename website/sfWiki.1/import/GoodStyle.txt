Quoting Ward Cunningham, who build the first Wiki: ( http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors )

Go ahead and be chatty. But, if you write in the first person you should sign your
piece. And when adding to a signed piece add a line (a string of minus signs) before
your stuff. In general, though, this isn't a news group. If you don't like something,
edit it. If you want to save the opposing viewpoint (however naive), create a new
WikiName playing off of the original. 

The WikiWikiWeb server has very simple TextFormattingRules. You won't go wrong
if you start each line without spaces and separate paragraphs with a blank line.
Run capitalized words together to make hyperlinks. This sometimes requires
creativity; you're up to it. 

This thing is made for rambling. Go ahead and start something. Others will come
along later to fill in the details. Here's a list of RecentVisitors just waiting for your
additions. 

One last thing. Please, Please, don't say things to make others mad. And don't say
anything that would get me arrested. Many thanks.
