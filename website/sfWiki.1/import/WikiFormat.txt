Using %WikiFormat%ting is GoodStyle, though the Wiki accepts some specific
HTML markup:

H?, CODE, CITE, KBD, PRE, Q, SUB, SUP, S, STRIKE, TT, and VAR.

<h1>header one</h1>

<H2>header two</H2>

<code>code</code>

<KBD>kbd</KBD>

<pre>pre</pre>

<q>quote</q>

<sub>subscript</sub><sup>superscript</sup>

<s>s-tag</s>

<strike>strikethrough</strike>

<tt>texttype</tt>

<var>variable</var>

WikiLinks.  When you RunWordsTogether, the Wiki
automagically creates a link to the page in the Wiki named RunWordsTogether,
even if the page doesn\'t exist.  If you click on a link to a non-existent topic,
you\'ll be offered the chance to create it.  (Try clicking on RunWordsTogether!)

Other features the Wiki has for making formatting easier:

Lists:

   * Unordered lists can be created with either [three spaces]* or [tab]*; adding more tabs or more triplets of spaces increases the list depth.

   # Similarly, ordered lists can be created using [three spaces][number]. or [tab][number]., or [three spaces]# or [tab]#.

   Definition: lists are created with [three spaces]word: or [tab]word:.

Formatting:

   * *words* between asterisks (*) bolds things; _words_ between underscorse (_) italices (emphasizes) them, and they can be combined and overlapped.

   * A blank line starts a new paragraph.
   * http://url or https://url and the like are automatically linked.  If the URL ends in gif, png, jpg, or jpeg, it will be converted to an <nolink>IMG</nolink> link.
   * &gt; text until the end of the line generates a block quote.
   * ---- will insert a horizontal rule.
   * | cell | cell | ... | cell | at the beginning of a line will generate tables:

| cell | cell | ... | cell |


WikiLinks

   * BumpyCaps will form links.
   * Enclosing %anything at all% in % marks forces a WikiLink.  (So will enclosing it in brackets ([]), or in &lt;link&gt;&lt;/link&gt; tags.) To _prevent_ a <nolink>WikiLink</nolink>, use &lt;nolink&gt;&lt;/nolink&gt;.

<h3>Additional Formatting (sfWiki Extensions)</h3>

*CVS Links*

You can access the latest version of a file in CVS at SourceForge with a cvs link: cvs://project/repository/dir/file
This link is displayed on the page the same way it is entered, highlighted like a normal link.
But it has been translated into a much longer URL for CVS access.

(Note that project and repository are often the same.)

*Fancy Links*

Html-like linking can be done using the form link-->text, where link is a http, https, or cvs URL, and where the whole thing is enclosed in % marks.

*Inclusions*

To include the text from a link into the body of the displayed topic, enclose the link -- cvs:// or a normal URL -- in curly braces, },{. (Reversed because of a WikiBug I'm working fixing now.  Sorry.  -- ToddMiller)
