06/25/2001: Fixed mo' bugs. :)  Statistics work properly now, and the whole-wiki
	    totals are displayed at the bottom of the topics page.  offsite.php3
	    has been modified to slurp configuration data out of site.inc, so
	    it should be easier to set up.  Added several new markups: fancy links,
	    cvs links, and inclusions.  (See WikiFormat.)  Added more to the
	    topic tables: [info] links, and (depending on context) last editor
	    and current month/last-year-total views.  Added a list-of-orphans
	    page.  Added a third ordering to the hubs-and-nodes page:
	    order by sum of current and last month's views.  The info page
	    now lists links out of a topic which haven't been created yet.
	    I think that about covers it. :)

05/11/2001: Added statistics table, $_SITE["dbstattable"].  See example/site.inc.
	    When updating for this release, you must re-run ./gen-table.php3
	    to build the statistics table, and ./zero-stats.php3 to initialize it.

04/21/2001: Froze Release 3.

04/11/2001: Many fixes, features, etc, implemented over last month for
	    http://wiki.jos.org; will be backporting the changes once
	    stable for sfWiki R3.

03/12/2001: Uploaded release 3 candidate.  Unified dynamic/static headers
	    and footers; corrected links with spaces in them; implemented
	    user utilities, authenticated editing, etc.

02/21/2001: Committed the last month's work on sessions, user authentication,
	    and the like.

01/29/2001: Many formatting tweaks, fixes; all static pages now use
	    the unified table printing; implemented single-copy
	    rollback (revision control); added back-end for 
	    (SID-only) sessions.

01/26/2001: Unified the architecture for table printing.

12/16/2000: Fixed bug #125245, 'embedded image links not converted to IMGs'.
	    Tagged current CVS as R2-0-3.

12/15/2000: Completed task #23260, 'convert HTML to lowercase'.
	    This fixes bug #125246, 'ACRONYMS not linking'.

12/14/2000: Added user interface to take advantage of MySQL power in
	    topics.php3, hubsnodes.php3, and changes.php3.  (Allow
	    particular a range (on some, of adjustable size) of results.)

12/12/2000: Pages older than the formatting no longer migrate to the top
	    of the topics list.  Syntax error in query_failed corrected.
	    Added ability to send administrator email on a failed
	    database operation.  Added persistent database connections.
	    Fixed the way that orphans are detected.  Added high-speed
	    orphan-detection routine to the topic list.  Corrected
	    ugly bug in re-rendering of topics with obsolete formatting.
	    Changed topic page to order alphabetically and display last
	    revision date.  (May reconsider.)

	    Tagged current CVS as R2-0-2.

12/12/2000: sfWiki release 2.0
