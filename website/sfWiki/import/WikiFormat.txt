Using %WikiFormat%ting is GoodStyle, though the Wiki accepts some specific
HTML markup:

H?, CODE, CITE, KBD, PRE, Q, SUB, SUP, S, STRIKE, TT, and VAR.

WikiLinks.  When you RunWordsTogether, the Wiki
automagically creates a link to the page in the Wiki named RunWordsTogether,
even if the page doesn't exist.  If you click on a link to a non-existent topic,
you'll be offered the chance to create it.  (Try clicking on RunWordsTogether!)

Other features the Wiki has for making formatting easier:

Lists:

	* Unordered lists can be created with either [three spaces]* or [tab]*; adding more tabs or more triplets of spaces increases the list depth.

	# Similarly, ordered lists can be created using [three spaces][number]. or [tab][number]., or [three spaces]# or [tab]#.

	Definition: lists are created with [three spaces]word: or [tab]word:.

Formatting:

	* *words* between asterisks (*) bolds things; _words_ between underscorse (_) italices (emphasizes) them, and they can be combined and overlapped.

	* A blank line starts a new paragraph.
	* http://url or https://url and the like are automatically linked.  If the URL ends in gif, png, jpg, or jpeg, it will be converted to an <nolink>IMG</nolink> link.
	* > text until the end of the line generates a block quote.
	* ---- will insert a horizontal rule.
	* | cell | cell | ... | cell | at the beginning of a line will generate tables:

| cell | cell | ... | cell |


WikiLinks

	* BumpyCaps will form links.
	* Enclosing %text with spaces% in % marks % forces a WikiLink.
	* <nolink>ThisIsNotAWikiLink</nolink> because it's enclosed in &lt;nolink&gt;&lt;/nolink&gt; tags.
	* cvs://repository/cvsroot/dir/file will link to the CVS file in the named repository (project) at SourceForge.

Finally, if you erase all the text from the body and the summary of a topic
while editing, and save it, the Wiki will delete that page.
