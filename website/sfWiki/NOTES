* backup.php3 dumps the MySQL tables to the backup directory, and
* restore.php3 does the reverse.
* Be careful scheduling backup.php3 as a cron job; the MySQL tables
	can get very big very quickly, and you'll hit your quota. 
* portal/import.php3 can be used to import /any/ text file into the Wiki.
	This can be useful if you're migrating from another Wiki, or have
	a large document.  If it times out, run it again; it moves the
	imported files from .txt to .imp extensions to allow for this.
* portal/export.php3 writes out the text of the WikiTopic(s).  This
	can be useful if you're migrating to a different Wiki.
* portal/touch.php3 calls checkRendering() on every topic in the Wiki.  If
	portal/*.ihtml is newer than the last save, the topic is re-saved.
	While this /will/ happen automagically behind the scenes as each topic
	is viewed, you can use this script if some feature is introduced, and
	you want to take fullest advantage of it.
