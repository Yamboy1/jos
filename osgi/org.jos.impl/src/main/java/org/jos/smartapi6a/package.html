	This package contains the application programming interface (API) for
	the Smart API. Typically, a program uses the URI class to request an
	object from Smart API plugins.

	<h2>Package Specification</h2>
	This version of the Smart API embraces a plug-in architecture; all
	controllers are now plug-ins. A plug-in identifies itself as an
	instance of org.jos.smartapi5a.Controller with:
	<code>META-INF/service/org.jos.smartapi5a.Controller</code>

	To use a plug-in, add it to your classpath. Any plug-in available on
	classpath is included. Unlike previous versions, it is no longer
	necessary to maintain a list of recommended controllers. This version
	embraces on-demand loading of plug-ins. When a scheme is never used,
	its controller is never loaded. All scheme-based controllers are loaded
	only when an actualy request uses the scheme.
