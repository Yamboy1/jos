<STRONG><a href="Zip.html">Zip</a></STRONG> is the tentative name for my planned <a href="WinZip.html">WinZip</a>-like <! page="">JOS</a> program. Help from others is more than welcome!
</p><p>
The main problem with <a href="WinZip.html">WinZip</a> (IMHO) is that it doesn't intuitively support .tar/.gz compression. Since gzip gets better compression than zip most of the time, the app I want to work on would do a better job. Users would be able to decompress (and create!) both .zip and .tgz files in the same fashion. .tgz files would then be treated just like .zip files, instead of like separate .tar and .gz files. Hope that made sense. 
</p><p>
Please add your comments/ideas to this page!

The main component of a Zip program for <! page="">JOS</a> should of course be 
excellent support for packaging .jar files.  The only graphical
program that
I know of that we have available now is <! page="">MoaJar</a>, which can be a
pain to use at times.  An intuitive program that handles .jar 
files, manifest and all, would be greatly appreciated by the
Java community.

Doink! I don't know why I didn't think of it! This of course
makes perfect sense, and will definitely be included.

..here's one thing that I don't like about <a href="WinZip.html">WinZip</a>,
</p><p>
<ul> <li> You can't create multiple files of a specific size.  Let's say that I had an application i wanted to distribute so that people could d/l it in 2mb pieces.  It would be nice if the app allowed you to select the size of the file, and make the appropriate number of files at that size.
</ul> 
..here's the address of another Java based zipping tool:
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.compaction-tech.com/jzip.html">http://www.compaction-tech.com/jzip.html</a>
</p><p>
..the site was unavailable when i tried to go there, so I don't know much about it...except that it supports zip files (kinda obvious huh?)
</p><p>
<ul> <li> How hard would it be for the program to automatically use the most effective compression.  There could be an option that turns this on and off.  It would be able to make an educated guess (based on the file type) on which program would be the most beneficial.
</ul>

I'm not an expert on compression, but I think it really depends on the contents of the message. However, I have not seen anything where regular zip does a better job than gzip. gzip might take a little longer, but it's usually equal to or better than zip compression.
</p><p>
Someone please speak up if I'm wrong on this!
</p><p>
I do like your idea about being able to split up the zip files into a specified size (for example, 1.44 MB to split into floppies).

Try and separate things in: 
<ul> <li> classes to handle compressed files/streams
<li> <! page="">GUI</a>
<li> <! page="">TUI</a>
</ul> 
I don't think you can do much with Beans here...

I think that it would be better to have zip, jar, gzip, tar, and all other archive formats supported via <a href="JavaBeans.html">JavaBeans</a>. Perhaps these archives can be handled as Directories for purposes of interface integrability. As an example, I might create a new zip file, and move files into the archive with a drag and drop, or via a mv (move) command, and have the fact that it is an archive and not a directory be transparent.

How about the ability to look into and potentialy modify a zip file over a network?  There's a commercial app called <! page="">NetZip</a> that has these features.

Wayne, I checked out that site and information on it, but I don't quite understand how it could modify a zip file over a network unless it: (a) downloaded the entire file, modified it, and uploaded it again or (b) interfaced with a "netzip server" to make the modifications.
</p><p>
I'm also unclear about what you mean by "network." For example, do you mean <! page="">ANY</a> network, i.e. I give Zip a <! page="">URL</a> to a zip file and it loads just the entry list of compressed files? Or did you have something else in mind.

It would be nice to have support for these compression types as built in FS modules for JOS. What I mean is that instead of writing one program which deals with beans for zipping and unzipping archives, we make zipping and unzipping beans for various formats and then integrate them into the <a href="FileSystem.html">FileSystem</a> API. Perhaps Zip would then be useful as a sort of compression manager- a utility to recompress and optimize the archives.

 I never noticed this until a day or to ago, but winZip doesn't allow you to rename files in archives or change directories of stored files, and some times I need that...
</p><p>
 Another thing about zip is that there are no zip-progs with good built-in cryptogaphy, it should at least support java.security so it could be extended... hhmmm, maybe it should be able to be extended to allow new archive types, just a thought

Michael, the compression<->FS integration is a great idea!
</p><p>
The <a href="FilesystemArchitecture.html">FilesystemArchitecture</a> is fairly flexible and extensible. Over the last days I wondered why I didn't design it a little bit simpler - now I know! I'll think about the details about how we can integrate compression modules.
