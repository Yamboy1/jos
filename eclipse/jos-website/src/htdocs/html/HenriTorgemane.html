Henri Torgemane <a href="mailto:henri.torgemane@etu.utc.fr">henri.torgemane@etu.utc.fr</a>
( kind of ugly web page around <a href="http://wwwhp.utc.fr/~htorgema/">http://wwwhp.utc.fr/~htorgema/</a> )
</p><p>
  Computer (science|engineering) student somewhere in France..  
</p><p>
  <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> addict, java lover..
</p><p>
More about me later..
</p><p>
First, I'm still diggin the site to find the answer to my questions
that aren't in the faq.. 
 Roughly,
	 - does it work on one machine, many or all?	
	 - will it be a mix of C and Java, pure Java, mix of asm and Java?
	 - will it execute bytecodes and/or compile them? Are some 
	insane hackers going to write a cross-platform <! page="">JIT</a> compiler
	for this purpose?
	 - if not, how can Jos ever hope to be kind of fast?
	 - Is jos going to be based entirely on sun implementation of
	java.*, or will we rewrite most of it?
	 - The timeline seems to have a few projects started. Where are the		 interfaces these piece of code are going to follow? Do we code		 first, and then try to guess what kind of interface would		 still work with the existing code?
</p><p>
Anyway, if I can't find, say, 30% of these answers, in the next two days, then I'm probably going to spam a list of two in my futile
attempt to find answers..
</p><p>
<hr>
</p><p>
Hmm.  Well we could actually use help to answer some of 
these questions.  For some of them, I guess the best answer...
we will know when we get there.	As for what language it
will be implemented in... most likely C and assembly
although there is a project somwhere to write a Java 
to C translator.  When we finally wressle loose Stephen's
code we will have a clue what the pico kernel is written in.
(although there is nothing saying that we <EM>have</EM> to use
it if someone else writes a better one.).  
</p><p>
To help answer some of your questions.. there were tons of 
discussion about many of these points in the mail archives...
</p><p>
Here is my take
</p><p>
<ul> <li> does it work on one machine, many or all?	
</ul> 
It will initially work on a 486 processor... and any
other processors people port it to.  
</p><p>
<ul> <li> will it be a mix of C and Java, pure Java, mix of asm and Java?
</ul> 
Most likely a mix.  As much in Java as possible... then C, then 
assembler when necessary.  A Java to C translator of some sort
might be used as well as the <a href="GNU.html">GNU</a> C compiler.
</p><p>
<ul> <li> will it execute bytecodes and/or compile them? Are some 
</ul> 	insane hackers going to write a cross-platform <! page="">JIT</a> compiler
	for this purpose?
</p><p>
Hopefully we can write the VM so that this design decision can
have more than one implementation.  Kaffe does <! page="">JIT</a> and a few
people have been thinking that we will port this.  Although
I see the classes being compiled into native code when they
are "loaded" into the system... not necessarly ever time
an object instance is made.
</p><p>
<ul> <li> if not, how can Jos ever hope to be kind of fast?
</ul> 
Hmm.  There is a disucssion about <a href="JavaSoft.html">JavaSoft</a>'s hot spot
technology buried somewhere...  I don't think that
anything is a silver bullet.  It will most likely 
be an effective mix of technologies that people
are comfortable with.
</p><p>
<ul> <li> Is jos going to be based entirely on sun implementation of
</ul> 	java.*, or will we rewrite most of it?
</p><p>
We will have to rewrite all of it.... otherwise we cannot
distribute the operating system.  There are other
organizations starting to do this... hopefully we will
be able to leverage the best of their work.
</p><p>
<ul> <li> The timeline seems to have a few projects started. Where are the		 interfaces these piece of code are going to follow?
</ul> 
Good question.  There is no right answer or central athority here.  
I think it would be great to get a design repository going and
a standard modeling tool... Playground seems good enough.
Alghough there is often the risk of designing/talking too much
and not getting anything done.. or producing an acedemic design
that has no practial chance of being implemented.  I have often
done the latter so feel that digging into code for discovery 
purposes has merit.
</p><p>
<ul> <li> Do we code first, and then try to guess what kind of interface would still work with the existing code?
</ul> 
Depends on which group you are working in and how those
people work.  Bill and I are trying to work on a VM 
design... others are porting Kaffee, others have already
exsting shells (jsh) waiting to be bolted on and others
are busily brainstorming.  There is no right answer here.
</p><p>
If you are intrested in helping organize, we could always
use the help..... Help with the FAQ?
