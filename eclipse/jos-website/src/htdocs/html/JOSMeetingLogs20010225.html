### Log session started at Sat Feb 24 22:44:53 2001 ###
[22:45:32] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I'm thinking John put that in there as a place-holder, but I'm not sure if it's a real function.
[22:45:37] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I don't have it at any rate.
[22:46:18] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Hm.  That's cute, ProcessServer.c has broken syntax.  Maybe I missed something in CVS.
[22:47:16] &lt;_Quinn&gt; !argh
[22:47:26] &lt;jdunrue&gt; Yeah, he needs a #include for pthread.h.
[22:47:38] &lt;_Quinn&gt; I have to rewrite the makefile -- my default gcc isn't 2.95.2
[22:47:54] &lt;_Quinn&gt; er, the .makeme files
[22:47:56] &lt;_Quinn&gt; bbiab
[22:48:17] &lt;jdunrue&gt; What have you been working on lately?
[22:49:03] &lt;_Quinn&gt; sfWiki, actually :)
[22:49:19] &lt;_Quinn&gt; I'm supposed to be working on porting the console drivers from JJOS/decaf, but I haven't had time yet.
[22:49:39] &lt;jdunrue&gt; That's cool.  That wiki thing is new to me.
[22:49:45] &lt;_Quinn&gt; I'm in a race with the JOS webmaster to see who finishes their part of the site first :)
[22:49:48] &lt;jdunrue&gt; Ha!
[22:50:30] &lt;_Quinn&gt; (fixing gcc didn't help.)
[22:50:38] &lt;_Quinn&gt; which file is missing pthread.h?
[22:50:50] &lt;jdunrue&gt; ProcessService.c, I believe.  Let me check my e-mail.
[22:50:59] &lt;jdunrue&gt; ProcessServer.c
[22:51:02] &lt;_Quinn&gt; It looks like I'm winning, but we'll see.  It's a good way to make us get the work done, though.
[22:51:05] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Ah.  BBIAB.
[22:51:37] &lt;_Quinn&gt; #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;?
[22:51:48] &lt;jdunrue&gt; yup
[22:52:13] &lt;_Quinn&gt; OK, that worked.  But he also forgot to include jvmdi/ in the .makeme file.  hold on.
[22:52:59] &lt;_Quinn&gt; No, it looks they aren't in CVS ?!
[22:53:12] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I didn't see them in my last update, either.
[22:53:26] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I got the kernel version compiled, but there are unresolved symbols at run-time.
[22:53:27] &lt;_Quinn&gt; I have jvmdi.c, but not misc, reflections, or monitors -- is your build trying to pick them up?
[22:53:51] &lt;jdunrue&gt; hang on
[22:54:40] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I have to recompile user mode to see that again.
[22:54:45] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Well I committed the fix for ProcessServer.c
[22:54:47] &lt;_Quinn&gt; OK.
[22:55:00] &lt;_Quinn&gt; I'm checking my kernel build, now, too
[22:55:52] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Oh, BTW, are you logging this?
[22:56:17] &lt;jdunrue&gt; Yes.  But turn on logging on your end anyway.  I'm a IRC newbie and I might
[22:56:33] &lt;jdunrue&gt; have made a mistake.  This is the first time I've used KVirc.
[22:56:47] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I too am missing misc, reflection, and monitors.
[22:57:47] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Hm.  I'm not an IRC newbie, but I don't how to turn on ircii's logging.  I'll futz with it.
[22:58:08] &lt;jdunrue&gt; KVirc has a menu item that I hit to do it, but my log file is not growing.
[22:58:30] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Hm...
[22:58:49] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Well, I think my fix for processerver broke the kernel build. :)
[22:58:59] &lt;jdunrue&gt; oops :-)
[22:59:09] &lt;jdunrue&gt; that's a pun, by the way
[22:59:38] &lt;_Quinn&gt; huh?
[22:59:43] &lt;jdunrue&gt; never mind
[22:59:48] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Sorry, missed it :)
[22:59:57] &lt;jdunrue&gt; Do you have any opinion on my issue with the JDI spec?
[23:00:01] &lt;jdunrue&gt; licensing, that is?
[23:00:26] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Oh, I thought you meant the com.sun.* namespace
[23:00:35] &lt;jdunrue&gt; well, yeah, that's really what I mean
[23:00:44] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I'm spooked by it.
[23:00:53] &lt;jdunrue&gt; But I don't see what alternative there could be.
[23:00:58] &lt;_Quinn&gt; It sure /looks/ fishy :)
[23:01:07] &lt;jdunrue&gt; People must be allowed to implement that stuff.  That's the namespace
[23:01:19] &lt;jdunrue&gt; that third-party debuggers would be using.
[23:01:35] &lt;jdunrue&gt; Because that's the spec -- kind of a circular argument.
[23:01:35] &lt;_Quinn&gt; yeah.  com.sun.* isn't just implementation stuff, either?
[23:01:58] &lt;jdunrue&gt; Not as far as I can tell.  They make it sound like *that* is the spec.
[23:02:09] &lt;jdunrue&gt; So I'm going to move ahead and assume we will be OK.
[23:02:21] &lt;jdunrue&gt; Let 'em sue me :-)
[23:02:47] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Yeah :)
[23:03:03] &lt;_Quinn&gt; OK, I just talked the kernel into building.
[23:03:34] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I get a bunch of c-library type of functions unresolved when I do the insmod thing.
[23:04:03] &lt;_Quinn&gt; I haven't tried insmoding it yet.  It hasn't blown up recently, but I wanted to check the other two builds first.
[23:04:17] &lt;jdunrue&gt; BTW, where can I go to get RJK?
[23:04:43] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I've got a separate machine here at home that I can test stuff on and not mess up my main machine.
[23:05:58] &lt;_Quinn&gt; The missing files only show up in the user build, so I bet John is testing them out there.
[23:06:21] &lt;_Quinn&gt; good question.  I think SourceForge.  I'll go check -- I got emailed the source they're using
[23:07:04] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I found Robert's user name on SourceForge, but he isn't listed as having a project with the initials RJK
[23:07:15] &lt;jdunrue&gt; last time I checked.
[23:07:28] &lt;_Quinn&gt; *shrug*  Let me check if I still have the archive lying around.
[23:07:42] &lt;_Quinn&gt; I do -- did you want it emailed?
[23:07:48] &lt;jdunrue&gt; yes, please!
[23:07:55] &lt;_Quinn&gt; I have two machines too, but not two keyboards and monitors :(
[23:08:18] &lt;jdunrue&gt; If I could only get my network straightened out, then I'd really be in good shape.
[23:08:41] &lt;_Quinn&gt; It's en-route.
[23:08:46] &lt;jdunrue&gt; ok, thanks
[23:08:49] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Yeah, same here :)
[23:09:13] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I am trying to avoid buying another NIC, but I can't get aliasing to work with ipchains
[23:09:34] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I can get the alias for eth0 alright, but ipchains doesn't recognize it
[23:09:35] &lt;_Quinn&gt; OK, I can't get RJK to build... investigating
[23:09:53] &lt;jdunrue&gt; a topic for LinuxHelp anyway :-)
[23:10:02] &lt;_Quinn&gt; I know almost nothing about networking, unfortunately.
[23:10:58] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I got the rjk archive, thanks again.
[23:11:10] &lt;jdunrue&gt; Any idea how far along this is?
[23:11:36] &lt;_Quinn&gt; RJK?  Further than the JJOS kernel, and it has threads, but I don't know much more than that.
[23:13:51] &lt;jdunrue&gt; On another topic... has anyone heard from the guy that was starting the Opal project, which I
[23:14:05] &lt;jdunrue&gt; think is/was supposed to be a GUI for JOS.
[23:14:17] &lt;jdunrue&gt; Nothing from him on the list, lately.
[23:14:27] &lt;_Quinn&gt;  /I/ sure haven't.
[23:15:05] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I'm personally glad to have stumbled upon something I can work on (JOSDI) that I'm pretty sure won't
[23:15:10] &lt;jdunrue&gt; get my employer up-tight.
[23:15:44] &lt;_Quinn&gt; who do you work for?
[23:15:47] &lt;jdunrue&gt; Sybase
[23:17:07] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Ah.
[23:17:12] &lt;_Quinn&gt; OK, here's the RJK problem.
[23:17:13] &lt;_Quinn&gt; struct native_thread_lock {
[23:17:13] &lt;_Quinn&gt;	tOBREF object;  
[23:17:13] &lt;_Quinn&gt;	struct native_thread_lock* next;
[23:17:13] &lt;_Quinn&gt;	kuint thread_id;
[23:17:13] &lt;_Quinn&gt;	int iHasCondition; 
[23:17:14] &lt;_Quinn&gt; };
[23:17:30] &lt;_Quinn&gt; About which the compiler is furiously complaining, just before the kuint.
[23:17:31] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Ideas?
[23:17:42] &lt;jdunrue&gt; what's the nature of the complaint?
[23:17:49] &lt;jdunrue&gt; syntax errors?
[23:17:57] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Oh, yeah, hold on a second :)
[23:18:45] &lt;_Quinn&gt; vm/threads_native.h:27: parse error before `kuint'
[23:18:45] &lt;_Quinn&gt; vm/threads_native.h:27: warning: no semicolon at end of struct or union
[23:18:45] &lt;_Quinn&gt; vm/threads_native.h:33: parse error before `}'
[23:19:02] &lt;_Quinn&gt; (I pasted in from the preprocessed version.)
[23:20:25] &lt;jdunrue&gt; not sure, I'm doing some digging...
[23:20:50] &lt;_Quinn&gt; maybe it doesn't like the 'struct' on the previous line?
[23:21:38] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I /thought/ that was legal.
[23:21:49] &lt;_Quinn&gt; So did I... :)
[23:22:10] &lt;_Quinn&gt; well, pulling the struct out gives me
[23:22:11] &lt;_Quinn&gt; vm/threads_native.h:18: parse error before `native_thread_lock'
[23:22:12] &lt;_Quinn&gt; vm/threads_native.h:18: warning: no semicolon at end of struct or union
[23:22:12] &lt;_Quinn&gt; vm/threads_native.h:27: warning: type defaults to `int' in declaration of `thread_id'
[23:22:12] &lt;_Quinn&gt; vm/threads_native.h:27: warning: data definition has no type or storage class
[23:22:12] &lt;_Quinn&gt; vm/threads_native.h:33: parse error before `}'
[23:22:34] &lt;jdunrue&gt; gcc 2.95.2 thinks it is OK, too.
[23:22:51] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I wonder if there is a missing declaration for tOBREF?
[23:23:06] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I meant, gcc thinks the example I just cooked up is OK.
[23:23:31] &lt;jdunrue&gt; {
[23:23:31] &lt;jdunrue&gt;	  struct xxx* y;
[23:23:31] &lt;jdunrue&gt; };
[23:23:37] &lt;jdunrue&gt; oops
[23:23:39] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Really?  I thought I was using gcc 2.95.2; maybe I blew my rewrite.
[23:23:41] &lt;_Quinn&gt; bbiab
[23:23:51] &lt;jdunrue&gt; struct xxx
[23:23:51] &lt;jdunrue&gt; {
[23:23:51] &lt;jdunrue&gt;	  struct xxx* y;
[23:23:51] &lt;jdunrue&gt; };
[23:23:57] &lt;jdunrue&gt; seems to compile OK for me
[23:25:51] &lt;_Quinn&gt; OK, I'm trying something else right now.
[23:26:14] &lt;jdunrue&gt; ok, I'm coding, so take your time.
[23:26:24] &lt;_Quinn&gt; No, I'm getting the same error, even with gcc-2.95.2 used explicitly.
[23:26:35] _Quinn tests the user build.
[23:27:27] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Heh, though I saw a warning: "Inelegant code used, ignoring."
[23:27:35] &lt;_Quinn&gt; OK, user build likes me.
[23:27:48] &lt;_Quinn&gt; (except for the missing bits)
[23:28:17] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I'm constantly surprised by the kinds of messages gcc spits out.
[23:28:49] &lt;jdunrue&gt; Sometimes, it's like -- hey you idiot, you forgot a semi-colon, here let me put it in there for you.
[23:28:57] &lt;_Quinn&gt; No, I'm pretty sure I was hallucinating :)
[23:29:22] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Wouldn't it be nice if it actually did, though? :)
[23:29:54] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I don't know, I'd be leery of any kind of compiler that "smart" :-)
[23:30:52] &lt;jdunrue&gt; speaking of C compilers, do you suppose it will be a goal for JOS (name your flavor) to
[23:31:04] &lt;jdunrue&gt; be self-hosting at some point.  A long time down the road, I know.
[23:32:57] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Actually, JOS will self-hosting once we get a filesystem working, I think: I'm pretty sure Sun's javac is written in java.
[23:33:07] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Or did you mean C also?
[23:33:20] &lt;jdunrue&gt; but the kernels are in C and asm
[23:33:26] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Something about kuint is really just pissing gcc off.
[23:33:46] &lt;jdunrue&gt; the vm is in C, too
[23:34:01] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I think gcc just doesn't like you this evening.
[23:34:09] &lt;_Quinn&gt; If I change it to /*ku*/int, it works fine until a function has kuint as a return value.
[23:34:20] &lt;_Quinn&gt; And the RJK build is working for you?  (Or have you not tried it?)
[23:34:34] &lt;_Quinn&gt; I'm tempted to believe in personal enmity too, at this point.
[23:34:59] &lt;jdunrue&gt; haven't tried it.  I've been poking at my own code.  I haven't looked at whether the RJK
[23:35:22] &lt;jdunrue&gt; code needs to be in a special place, or what other funny things need to be done for it all to build right.
[23:37:15] &lt;jdunrue&gt; a ha
[23:37:28] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I see at least one magic path in .makemeRJK
[23:37:46] &lt;_Quinn&gt; I changed it, but I didn't change it right.
[23:38:08] &lt;_Quinn&gt; And John is also using a more recent version of RJK, it looks like
[23:38:16] &lt;_Quinn&gt; sorry, less recent
[23:38:55] &lt;jdunrue&gt; life on the bleedin' edge, man... gotta love it :-)
[23:39:44] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Yeah.  I don't think John has quite wrapped his head around using CVS with/for other developers :)
[23:39:52] &lt;_Quinn&gt; OK, that time it went right together.
[23:40:08] &lt;_Quinn&gt; *sigh*
[23:40:28] &lt;_Quinn&gt; I'm also curious as to why current/k* are there, but whatever...
[23:40:36] &lt;jdunrue&gt; gcc has deigned to accomodate you
[23:40:47] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Yes, it aims to be mysterious.
[23:40:50] &lt;jdunrue&gt; CVS is non-intuitive, I have found.
[23:40:58] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I have to deal with lots of people that have never used it.
[23:41:01] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Like a fine woman, you must court gcc carefully
[23:41:30] &lt;_Quinn&gt; It's non-intuitive, but I'm talking more about things like hardcoding your home directory.  That's what variables (or relative paths) are for.
[23:41:39] &lt;jdunrue&gt; Oh yeah, gotcha.
[23:42:21] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I'm going to give this a whirl and see if it will build for me.  what did you end up having to do?
[23:42:27] &lt;jdunrue&gt; RJK that is.
[23:43:13] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Oh.  I had replaced &lt;john's home dir&gt;/rjk.20010204 with &lt;path-to-my-copy&gt;rjk.20010204, but I had rjk-20010211 :)
[23:43:56] &lt;jdunrue&gt; hang on, let me get this file tweaked for my setup, and we'll see what happens
[23:45:06] _Quinn hangs
[23:46:16] &lt;jdunrue&gt; &lt;compiling&gt;
[23:46:48] &lt;jdunrue&gt; well, whatcha know... kuint strikes again
[23:47:07] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Argh!
[23:47:10] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Same place?
[23:47:28] &lt;jdunrue&gt; line 55 of vm/garbage.c
[23:47:47] &lt;jdunrue&gt; uh, waitaminnut
[23:48:13] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I mean line 26 of vm/threads_native.h
[23:49:20] &lt;jdunrue&gt; so yeah, same place
[23:49:28] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Hm.  CVS is showing a change in that file on my machine, but the diff is empty.
[23:49:37] &lt;_Quinn&gt; I'll commit it anyway, and let you try it.
[23:50:47] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Try now
[23:50:54] &lt;jdunrue&gt; ok
[23:51:15] &lt;jdunrue&gt; &lt;compiling&gt;
[23:51:36] &lt;jdunrue&gt; same error
[23:52:04] &lt;_Quinn&gt; OK.  And you've the k*.h files in current/?
[23:52:39] &lt;jdunrue&gt; kimplementation.h, kinterface.h	 am I missing anything?
[23:53:11] &lt;jdunrue&gt; ok, i see the problem
[23:53:22] &lt;_Quinn&gt; nope.
[23:53:25] &lt;_Quinn&gt; you do?
[23:53:32] &lt;_Quinn&gt; You have sharper eyes than I :)
[23:53:56] &lt;jdunrue&gt; hang on a sec.
[23:54:23] &lt;jdunrue&gt; so is this compiling OK for you now?
[23:55:03] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I was wrong.
[23:55:07] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Yes...
[23:55:14] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I thought he didn't have -I. in the list of include paths.
[23:55:42] &lt;_Quinn&gt; grep .makemeRJK and make sure you didn't miss any 'jewel's?
[23:56:17] &lt;jdunrue&gt; oh boy, do I feel silly
[23:57:10] &lt;jdunrue&gt; the case of the bad search-and-replace.
[23:57:17] &lt;jdunrue&gt; let me try that again
[23:58:00] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Well, I did it twice, so don't feel too bad :)
[23:58:19] &lt;jdunrue&gt; :-)
[23:59:04] &lt;jdunrue&gt; needed to compile RJK itself, duh...
[23:59:13] &lt;jdunrue&gt; OK, it's built.
[23:59:25] &lt;jdunrue&gt; what does it boot with?
[00:00:14] &lt;_Quinn&gt; GRUB
[00:00:20] &lt;jdunrue&gt; oh...
[00:00:24] &lt;_Quinn&gt; I should have a boot-disk image lying around here somewhere
[00:00:34] &lt;jdunrue&gt; I guess I should break down and get grub installed on my other machine.
[00:00:52] &lt;jdunrue&gt; yeah, a boot-disk would be cool.
[00:01:07] &lt;jdunrue&gt; this would be an image you can just dd onto a floppy, right?
[00:02:24] &lt;_Quinn&gt; yes.
[00:02:34] &lt;_Quinn&gt; sorry, I'm looking at the -Wall stuff simultaneously
[00:02:46] &lt;_Quinn&gt; I'll email it.
[00:03:01] &lt;jdunrue&gt; ok, thanks.
[00:04:36] &lt;jdunrue&gt; btw, looks like my IRC log is functioning as expected, just missed the first exchange or two.
[00:04:44] &lt;_Quinn&gt; mail's away
[00:05:01] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Well, I suspect they weren't of earth-shaking importance anyway :)
[00:05:17] &lt;jdunrue&gt; Hate to be a party crasher, but I should probably get going in a minute.
[00:06:27] &lt;_Quinn&gt; That's fine.  Two in the morning is late enough for me :)
[00:06:35] &lt;_Quinn&gt; What's it for you, 6?
[00:06:53] &lt;jdunrue&gt; midnight, I'm in Colorado.  you must be East Coast?
[00:07:03] &lt;_Quinn&gt; (and we got everthing compiled already)
[00:09:09] &lt;jdunrue&gt; Earthlink's mail server is not cooperating with me.  I might have to wait until morning to check for your boot disk.
[00:09:21] &lt;_Quinn&gt; OK.
[00:09:37] &lt;jdunrue&gt; So, I will bid you adieu.  Thanks for dropping in :-)  Nice to meet you, virtually speaking.
[00:09:41] &lt;_Quinn&gt; Yes.  You said -4 GMT, so I though Europe for (+4 GMT)
[00:09:47] &lt;_Quinn&gt; llater!
[00:09:51] &lt;jdunrue&gt; bye
[00:10:05] &lt;_Quinn&gt; (which, of course, would make it more like ten over there, but whatever)
