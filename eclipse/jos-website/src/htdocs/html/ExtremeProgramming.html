<h1>eXtreme Programming Summary (for JOS)</h1>
</p><p>
(taken from Ron Jefferies <a href="http://www.armaties.com/extreme.htm">Extreme Programming</a> papers - see <a href="#ref1">reference</a> below).
</p><p>
When in doubt about these practises, get a few people together and decide what to do.
<hr>
<STRONG>The Four Project Values</STRONG>
</p><p>
Simplicity *+* Communication *+* Testing *=* Aggressiveness
</p><p>
<EM>Simplicity</EM>
<ul> <li> "Do the simplest thing that could possibly work"
<li> <STRONG><! page="">NEVER</a></STRONG> work on something "were gonna need"
</ul> <EM>Communication</EM>
<ul> <li> Code so as to express intention, not algorithm.
<li> Method names say what they accomplish, not how they accomplish it.
<li> Use <! page="">CRC</a> cards (--<a href="ClassResponsibiltiesAndCollaboration.html">ClassResponsibiltiesAndCollaboration</a>)
</ul> <EM>Testing</EM>
<ul> <li> Every class must have a corresponding unit test class.
<li> Each public method should have at least one unit test method.
<li> All the unit tests must run at 100% to release code.
<li> Functional Tests test system from end to end.
</ul> <EM>Aggressiveness</EM> (Fearlessness)
<ul> <li> We can change any part of the system to be better because we know we have a solid system of tests.
<li> We know we wont break the system, which gives us the confidence to move forward rapidly.
</ul> <hr>
<STRONG>Coding Styles:</STRONG>
<ul> <li> When we feel like breaking the formatting rules to make a method look better, we get better code by reformatting, in almost all cases. Give it a try.
</ul> These are not formatting rules but rather programming guidelines. The following are taken out of Linux Kernel Coding Style:
-- <a href="StefanBorg.html">StefanBorg</a>
<ul> <li> If you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway, and should fix your program. (ie don't nest your functions too deep - <a href="StefanBorg.html">StefanBorg</a>)
<li> Methods should be short and sweet, and do just one thing. They should fit on one or two screenfuls of text (the ISO/ANSI screen size is 80x24, as we all know), and do one thing and do that well.
<li> The maximum length of a function is inversely proportional to the complexity and indentation level of that function. So, if you have a conceptually simple function that is just one long (but simple) switch-statement, where you have to do lots of small things for a lot of different cases, it's ok to have a longer function.
<li> <! page="">LOCAL</a> variable names should be short, and to the point. If you have some random integer loop counter, it should probably be called "i". Calling it "loop_counter" is non-productive, if there is no chance of it being mis-understood. Similarly, "tmp" can be just about any type of variable that is used to hold a temporary value. 
<li> Number of local variables shouldn't exceed 5-10 per method, or you're doing something wrong. Re-think the function, and split it into smaller pieces.
<li> Your comments tell <! page="">WHAT</a> and possibly <! page="">WHY</a> your code does what it does, not HOW.
</ul> <hr>
<STRONG>Continuous Integration, Relentless Testing</STRONG>
</p><p>
We call the combination of frequent release with tests at 100%: <STRONG>continuous integration, relentless testing</STRONG> . The result is rapid progress and a system that always works better than it did the day before.
<hr>
<STRONG><! page="">CRC</a> Card Design</STRONG>
</p><p>
(see --<a href="ClassResponsibiltiesAndCollaboration.html">ClassResponsibiltiesAndCollaboration</a>)
<hr>
<STRONG>Task Iterations</STRONG>
</p><p>
(The following figures don't apply with <! page="">JOS</a> BUT should be proportional --<a href="StefanBorg.html">StefanBorg</a>)
<ul> <li> Teams consist of two people
<li> Bugs/features were broken down into engineering tasks.
<li> If task appears to require more than one engineering week, it must be broken down further.
<li> Task iterations are 3 weeks
<li> 1 task per team per iteration
</ul> 
<ul> <li> If the estimates for a task are so wrong that it doesnt complete within an iteration, it is likely that something isnt understood about the task.
<li> Quite possibly the team is trying to solve a problem that is too hard because of something wrong elsewhere in the system.
<li> If a task isnt going well, its probably on the wrong track and needs to be reset. Even if the code finally works, it will continue to be a problem.
<li> When a solution isnt fitting into the system, either the system is wrong or the solution is wrong.
</ul> <hr>
<STRONG>Documentation</STRONG>
</p><p>
<ul> <li> There is some written documentation for the software, more commonly interpreting requirements than documenting design.
<li> Sometimes we document an approach to some particularly difficult area.
<li> We "never" document code. (We rarely even comment it.)
</ul> 
Good reasons why we do <STRONG>not</STRONG> do more documentation:
<ul> <li> We do not believe that it would help us go faster;
<li> We do not believe that it would make the system more reliable;
<li> We do not believe that it would make the system more maintainable.
</ul> 
Good reasons why we <STRONG>should</STRONG> do more documentation:
<ul> <li> It might help other groups benefit from our process;
<li> It would make interesting reading to our customers;
<li> It would serve as the basis for useful papers in journals and conferences.
</ul> <hr>
<STRONG><! page="">ENVY</a> Guidelines</STRONG>
</p><p>
<ul> <li> Version frequently. Always version at end of day, to make it easier to bring the code up tomorrow.
<li> Our development teams typically release their software at least once per day. Yes, release. Yes, at least once per day.
</ul> <hr>
<STRONG>Functional Tests</STRONG>
</p><p>
<ul> <li> The test cases were defined by the users, and developed by a separate team whose job was to create tests.
<li> Functional tests have their own special GUI, which displays each step of the test, its execution time, and whether or not it succeeded. There is a score displayed.
<li> Functional tests did not have to score 100% during the project: adding features makes their scores go up. They do have to score 100% before release, and any substantial change in the tests is always worthy of note.
</ul> <hr>
<STRONG>The Four Variables</STRONG>
</p><p>
<EM>Scope, Quality, Resources, Time</EM>
</p><p>
There are four inter-related aspects to a software project:
<ul> <li> Scope - what is to be done; the features to be implemented;
<li> Quality - the requirements for correctness and other "good" things;
<li> Resources - the investment of personnel, equipment, and so on;
<li> Time - the duration of the project. 
</ul> The primary relationships are shown :
<ul> <li> Adding Scope (features) makes Time (duration) increase. Do more, take longer.
<li>  Increasing Quality requirements makes Time increase. Do better, take longer.
<li> Increasing available Resources can sometimes make Time decrease. Rarely. 
</ul> <hr>
