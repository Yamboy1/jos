</p><p>
2.3 To allow anyone to work on any project that they so wish. Competing implementations of the same functionality are allowed, and even desirable. The best design will be chosen by natural selection.

</p><p>
<h4>ARTICLE III General Provisions:</h4>

</p><p>

</p><p>
3.7 The content of this constitution and the policy book may not be altered or amended in any way except as a result of a vote being passed in accordance with Article IV of this constitution.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<h4>ARTICLE IV Voting:</h4>
<hr>
</p><p>
4.1 At certain times it may be desirable for a vote to be called amongst members to make decisions on important issues.
</p><p>
4.2 Voting issues shall be classified as "ordinary" and "extraordinary". "Extraordinary" votes shall be reserved for changes to the Constitution. All other issues shall be decided by "ordinary" votes.
</p><p>
4.3 A vote may be called by any voting member. If a voting member wishes to call a vote then this shall be advertised for a minimum number of days prior to the start of the vote in the manner described in the policy book. The minimum number of days shall be 2 for "ordinary" votes and 4 for "extraordinary" votes. The advertisement shall specify one member who has agreed to second the vote and a member who has agreed to act as a neutral administrator of the vote. The advertisement shall also specify the proposed wording of the question to be asked in the vote.
</p><p>
4.4 As a result of a vote advertisement any member may object to the choice of a vote administrator at any time before the start of the vote. An objection should be made by contacting the proposer of the vote and informing them of the objection. In the event of an objection the vote proposer can either withdraw the vote, or select a new administrator. In the latter case, the proposer shall place a new vote advertisement in accordance with paragraph 4.3. In addition, the proposer of a vote may withdraw his proposal without prejudice at any time prior to the beginning of vote tabulation by the administrator. Once vote tabulation has begun, no withdrawal request shall be entertained, and any vote result shall be considered valid and binding, subject to the satisfaction of all other voting criteria.
</p><p>
4.5 It should be deemed a contravention of this constitution if any member abuses paragraph 4.4 with the intention of preventing a vote from taking place.
</p><p>
4.6 Voting shall take place over a minimum period. This period shall be 3 days for "ordinary" votes and 6 days for "extraordinary" votes. Each member has a single vote, although it is permissible for a member to change their minds about a vote within the voting period. Changes in votes shall be corroborated by the vote adminstrator in the manner prescribed in the policy book.
</p><p>
4.7 Voting shall be secret. At no time during the voting period shall preliminary results be advertised. The voting procedure is detailed in the policy book.
</p><p>
4.8 It is the responsibility of the vote administrator to make a reasonable attempt to advertise the results of the vote to the "JOS*" membership within 1 day of the closure of the vote. Details of what is termed "reasonable" are available within the policy book. No vote shall be binding until the results are successfully advertised.
</p><p>
4.9 A vote is declared void if less than three votes have been received by the end of the voting period.
</p><p>
4.10 Valid votes shall be one of the following: [a] Yes (approve the proposal as stated) [b] No (disapprove the proposal as stated) [c] Neither with explanation (disagree with the phrasing of the question or some other procedural matter) [d] Abstain (no preference either way)
</p><p>
4.11 "Total vote count" shall be defined as the total of "yes", "no", and "neither" ballots received. A proposal is considered to have been approved if 51 percent of the total votes was 'yes' for "ordinary" votes and 75% for "extraordinary" votes, other wise the proposal is said to have been rejected. A proposal is considered to have failed to pass without prejudice if neither "yes" nor "no" vote totals failed to reach the required percent for the type of vote being conducted.
</p><p>
4.12 Members voting "neither" have the option of including an explanation of their reasons for voting this way with their vote. These explanations will be advertised with members names removed after voting has finished in the manner described in the policy book.
</p><p>
4.13 All vote proposals shall be worded in such a way that the status quo is maintained should the proposal not be approved or fail to pass without prejudice as defined in Article 4.11 of this document.
