<EM>The following article discusses issues to the proposal for changes to the  JOS Project Constitution. Posted by <a href="PhilipGonia.html">PhilipGonia</a> (16 August 2001).</EM>
</p><p>
<hr>
I still feel the Article IV needs to be changed to reflect some other method of voting. I liked Iain's discussion on a WEB based voting system where voting members go and make their votes by selecting a radial button or checkbox.
</p><p>
A much cleaner approach. I did not reflect this idea here because I was unsure as to how to outline such a system. Maybe Iain could make changes to Article IV?

Great job! I am in favor of small changes to the constitution.
<ul> <li> I don't want anyone to underestimate the power of paragraphs 2.3. It might be the most important concept presented in our constitution.
<li> Paragraph 2.1 should read "Create an open source, free <STRONG>license</STRONG>, extensible operating system."
<li> And paragraph 2.1.3 should read "Free <STRONG>license</STRONG> means that the operating system will be made available to end users for use free of <STRONG>licensing fees</STRONG>."
<li> Why require a number of days to announce a vote before people start to cast their vote? I wouldn't mind if there was no delay. People should start voting on a proposal as soon as it is proposed.
<li> Why require a replacement of the constitution? Amendments might help the constitution evolve as the project evolves.
</ul>

"Why require a number of days to announce a vote before people start to cast their vote? I wouldn't mind if there was no delay. People should start voting on a proposal as soon as it is proposed. -- <a href="GilbertHerschberger.html">GilbertHerschberger</a> (17 August 2001)"
</p><p>
I disagree. The proposal should be open for review and discussion for a period determined by the proposer. The proposal discussion is to be conduced in a manner we are using here. At such time that the proposer feels that a the discussion as reached some level of agreement (whereby s/he feels that a vote could be taken with positive results for the proposal) the proposer would place it up for a vote. This also allows any other member to post any competeing proposal. It may be that during this discussion time frame that one or more competeing proposals are used/combined to produce the final proposal that would then be opened for a vote. 
</p><p>
A vote advertisment may be made even during the final days of the discussion time frame. 
</p><p>
What we see goning on here is a simple debate on this current proposal (The JOS Constitution). This is a healthy process that should be allowed to continue for some time frame.
</p><p>
"Why require a replacement of the constitution? Amendments might help the constitution evolve as the project evolves.-- <a href="GilbertHerschberger.html">GilbertHerschberger</a> (17 August 2001)"
</p><p>
The current Constitution does not outline provisions for making amendments to its content. It does however allow changes to be made to it. See article 4.2.
I have added an additional section called "Appendix A Revision History" to provide a means of recording such changes. 
</p><p>
Since this is a proposed changed Constitution, it can be compared to the current approved one. Once this or other proposed Constitution has been voted on and approved, the <b>OLD</b> one should be placed in a historical archive.
</p><p>
I just feel that dealing with and adding the requirement of Amendments adds to much complexity to a document  thats is almost always a complex document to start with. Way add more work to a project that already has its work cut out.
</p><p>
I would like to see this be as simple as it has to be in order to get the job done.
