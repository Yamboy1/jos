<h2>Version 1.0</h2>
<font color="green">
<font color="red">N.B.</font> This is a proposed license. It is not definitive and indeed may need some work. Please comment heavily on the <a href="JOSPLDiscussion.html">JOSPLDiscussion</a> page.</font>

										  Version 1.0
</p><p>
										----------------
</p><p>
1. Definitions.
</p><p>
	  1.1. ``Contributor'' means each entity that creates or contributes to
	  the creation of Modifications.
</p><p>
	  1.2. ``Contributor Version'' means the combination of the Original
	  Code, prior Modifications used by a Contributor, and the Modifications
	  made by that particular Contributor.
</p><p>
	  1.3. ``Covered Code'' means the Original Code or Modifications or the
	  combination of the Original Code and Modifications, in each case
	  including portions thereof.
</p><p>
	  1.4. ``Electronic Distribution Mechanism'' means a mechanism generally
	  accepted in the software development community for the electronic
	  transfer of data.
</p><p>
	  1.5. ``Executable'' means Covered Code in any form other than Source
	  Code.
</p><p>
	  1.6. ``Initial Developer'' means the individual or entity identified as
	  the Initial Developer in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A.
</p><p>
	  1.7. ``Larger Work'' means a work which combines Covered Code or
	  portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.
</p><p>
	  1.8. ``License'' means this document.
</p><p>
	  1.9. ``Modifications'' means any addition to or deletion from the
	  substance or structure of either the Original Code or any previous
	  Modifications. When Covered Code is released as a series of files, a
	  Modification is:
</p><p>
			 A. Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file
			 containing Original Code or previous Modifications.
</p><p>
			 B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code or
			 previous Modifications.
</p><p>
	  1.10. ``Original Code'' means Source Code of computer software code
	  which is described in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A as
	  Original Code, and which, at the time of its release under this License
	  is not already Covered Code governed by this License.
</p><p>
	  1.11. ``Source Code'' means the preferred form of the Covered Code for
	  making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any
	  associated interface definition files, scripts used to control
	  compilation and installation of an Executable, or a list of source code
	  differential comparisons against either the Original Code or another
	  well known, available Covered Code of the Contributor's choice. The
	  Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form, provided the
	  appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is widely available
	  for no charge.
</p><p>
	  1.12. ``You'' means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
	  under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future
	  version of this License issued under Section 6.1. For legal entities,
	  ``You'' includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is
	  under common control with You. For purposes of this definition,
	  ``control'' means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
	  direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
	  otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
	  outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.
</p><p>
2. Source Code License.
</p><p>
	  2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
	  The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
	  non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
	  claims:
</p><p>
			 (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
			 distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without
			 Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and
</p><p>
			 (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial
			 Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``Utilize'') the
			 Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that
			 any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize
			 the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater
			 extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or
			 combinations.
</p><p>
	  2.2. Contributor Grant.
	  Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
	  non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
	  claims:
</p><p>
			 (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
			 distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or
			 portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other
			 Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and
</p><p>
			 (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
			 Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions
			 thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is
			 reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor
			 Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that
			 may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.
</p><p>
3. Distribution Obligations.
</p><p>
	  3.1. Application of License.
	  The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
	  governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
	  Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed
	  only under the terms of this License or a future version of this
	  License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
	  License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not
	  offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
	  restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
	  rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
	  offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.
</p><p>
	  3.2. Availability of Source Code.
	  Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
	  made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
	  either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
	  Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
	  Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
	  Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
	  months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
	  (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
	  has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
	  ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
	  Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
</p><p>
	  3.3. Description of Modifications.
	  You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a
	  file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
	  the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
	  Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
	  provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
	  Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
	  Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
	  origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
</p><p>
	  3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
</p><p>
			 (a) Third Party Claims.
			 If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property
			 right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization
			 under this License), you must include a text file with the source
			 code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and
			 the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
			 will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You
			 make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You
			 shall promptly modify the <! page="">LEGAL</a> file in all copies You make
			 available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
			 appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
			 inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has
			 been obtained.
</p><p>
			 (b) Contributor APIs.
			 If Your Modification is an application programming interface and
			 You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to
			 implement that API, you must also include this information in the
			 <! page="">LEGAL</a> file.
</p><p>
	  3.5. Required Notices.
	  You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
	  Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where
	  You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You
	  created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a
	  Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible
	  to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
	  structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a
	  relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such
	  a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
	  support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
	  of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and
	  not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must
	  make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or
	  liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
	  indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
	  incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
	  warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
</p><p>
	  3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
	  You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
	  requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
	  and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the
	  Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a
	  description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of
	  Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in
	  an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
	  describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may
	  distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of
	  Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
	  provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and
	  that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit
	  or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the
	  rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
	  version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
	  that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,
	  not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
	  indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
	  incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
	  any such terms You offer.
</p><p>
	  3.7. Larger Works.
	  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
	  not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
	  Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
	  requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
</p><p>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
</p><p>
	  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
	  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute
	  or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
	  to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
	  the code they affect. Such description must be included in the <! page="">LEGAL</a>
	  file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
	  distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by
	  statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
	  for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
</p><p>
5. Application of this License.
</p><p>
	  This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
	  attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.
</p><p>
6. Versions of the License.
</p><p>
	  6.1. New Versions.
	  The <! page="">JOS</a> Collective (``JOS'') may publish revised and/or new versions
	  of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a 
	  distinguishing version number.
</p><p>
	  6.2. Effect of New Versions.
	  Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
	  License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
	  version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
	  of any subsequent version of the License published by JOS. No one
	  other than <! page="">JOS</a> has the right to modify the terms applicable to
	  Covered Code created under this License.
</p><p>
	  6.3. Derivative Works.
	  If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
	  only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
	  governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the
	  phrases ``JOS'', ``JOSPL'', or any confusingly similar phrase do not 
	  appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that
	  your version of the license contains terms which differ from the 
	  <! page="">JOS</a> Public License and. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
	  Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall
	  not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)
</p><p>
7. <! page="">DISCLAIMER</a> OF WARRANTY.
</p><p>
	  <! page="">COVERED</a> CODE IS <! page="">PROVIDED</a> UNDER <! page="">THIS</a> LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS,

	  OF <! page="">WARRANTY</a> CONSTITUTES AN <! page="">ESSENTIAL</a> PART OF <! page="">THIS</a> LICENSE. NO <! page="">USE</a> OF
	  <! page="">ANY</a> COVERED <! page="">CODE</a> IS <! page="">AUTHORIZED</a> HEREUNDER <! page="">EXCEPT</a> UNDER <! page="">THIS</a> DISCLAIMER.
</p><p>
8. TERMINATION.
</p><p>
	  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
	  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
	  such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
	  sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
	  survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
	  nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
	  shall survive.

</p><p>
	  <! page="">UNDER</a> NO <! page="">CIRCUMSTANCES</a> AND <! page="">UNDER</a> NO <! page="">LEGAL</a> THEORY, <! page="">WHETHER</a> TORT

</p><p>
10. U.S. <! page="">GOVERNMENT</a> END USERS.
</p><p>
	  The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in
	  48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer
	  software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such
	  terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
	  C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
	  all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
	  rights set forth herein.
</p><p>
11. MISCELLANEOUS.
</p><p>
	  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
	  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
	  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
	  necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
	  California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
	  provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With
	  respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an
	  entity chartered or registered to do business in, the United States of
	  America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating
	  to this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual
	  property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration,
	  with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any
	  arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara
	  County, California, under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any
	  litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the
	  jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
	  California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with
	  the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation,
	  court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application
	  of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
	  Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
	  provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
	  drafter shall not apply to this License.
</p><p>
12. <! page="">RESPONSIBILITY</a> FOR CLAIMS.
</p><p>
	  Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with
	  Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or
	  indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based
	  on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the
	  revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant
	  factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute
	  responsibility on an equitable basis.
