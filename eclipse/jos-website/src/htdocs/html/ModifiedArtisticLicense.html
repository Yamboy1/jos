/**********************************************************************
 * The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
 * Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
 * semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
 * while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
 * the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to
 * make reasonable modifications.
 * 
 * Definitions:
 * "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
 * Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created
 * through textual modification.
 * 
 * "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
 * modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the
 * Copyright Holder.
 * 
 * "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights
 * for the package.
 * 
 * "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
 * Package.
 * 
 * "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of
 * media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on.
 * (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but
 * only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear
 * the fee.)
 * 
 * "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself,
 * though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means
 * that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same
 * conditions they received it.
 * 
 * 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of
 *	 the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided
 *	 that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices, this
 *	 license and associated disclaimers.
 * 
 * 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
 *	 derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A
 *	 Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the 
 *	 Standard Version.
 * 
 * 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
 *	 provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
 *	 stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you 
 *	 do at least ONE of the following:
 * 
 *	 a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make
 *		 them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to
 *		 Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on 
 *		 a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the 
 *		 Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard 
 *		 Version of the Package.
 * 
 *	 b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or
 *		 organization.
 * 
 *	 c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not 
 *		 conflict with standard executables, which must also be 
 *		 provided, and provide a separate manual page for each 
 *		 non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs 
 *		 from the Standard Version.
 * 
 *	 d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 * 
 * 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
 *	 executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the 
 *	 following:
 * 
 *	 a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library
 *		 files, together with instructions (in the manual page or 
 *		 equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
 * 
 *	 b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
 *		 the Package with your modifications.
 * 
 *	 c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
 *		 Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard 
 *		 executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the 
 *		 differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with 
 *		 instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
 * 
 *	 d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 * 
 * 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of
 *	 this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of 
 *	 this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. 
 *	 However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other
 *	 (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly 
 *	 commercial) software distribution provided that you do not 
 *	 advertise this Package as a product of your own.
 * 
 * 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
 *	 output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
 *	 under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever 
 *	 generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be 
 *	 aggregated with this Package.
 * 
 * 7. Any subroutines supplied by you which are not derived works of
 *	 this Package shall not be considered part of this Package.
 * 
 * 8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
 *	 promote products derived from this software without specific prior
 *	 written permission.
 * 
 * 9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
 *	 IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
 *	 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
