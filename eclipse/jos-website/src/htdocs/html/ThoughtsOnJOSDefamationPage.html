Okay, I realize now that it was just homorous, but at first glance it kind of took me aback.  Had it been more obvious from the beginning that it was not of serious origin, then I probably wouldn't have taken so much offence from it.  My apologies for making such a big hullaballoo, but I think that whoever wants to do stuff like that should make a better attempt at pointing out that it's humor only, rather than just leaving an anonymous link to the page from the main <! page="">JOS</a> page.

I'd like to propose that the Defamation page be moved off of the Main menu and onto the <! page="">JOS</a> members page who created it.  In this way it will be his view and not the views of the entire <! page="">JOS</a> community.  I feel uncomfortable with the humour of the Defamation page, and I certainly don't want anyone to have the idea that these views are JOS's views.
</p><p>
Ryan, I think the Defamation page was made in an ironic way, in order
to make fun of people who actually hold these views.  Nevertheless, I still don't feel comfortable with the humour, no matter how ironic or sarcastic it is.  I suggest to the Defamation author that he remove the Defamation link from the Main page and link to it from his Wiki name page; this will keep politics at bay.  Thanks.

I'd have to agree with Brad. But even though my own computer is of questionable sexual orientation, i'll have to admit i found the Defamation Page rather funny. And by the way, when the <! page="">JOS</a> member added the "Defamtion" link to the site, he did say that it was all in good fun and that he hoped it wouldn't offend anyone. Too bad it did.
</p><p>
The "Barney" animation was cute as well, but i'm not sure it's the best impression to leave on someone visiting the site for the first time. (If you didn't ever see Barney on the <! page="">JOS</a> site, then you went a long week without visiting the "main" page.)

<p align="JUSTIFY">I was just looking at the <! page="">JOS</a> Defamation Page, and it just made me think a bit.  If I'm not mistaken, a lot of the information presented on said page could be considered seditious libel, which of course could be brought up in a law suit against <! page="">DaveCo</a>. or whoever this guy is.  Personally, I don't really like to be called "UNWHOLESOME" without some sort of factual backup to the claim.  And I would think that James and <a href="DigiGod.html">DigiGod</a> would be offended by the respective "'gay homosexual' computer" and "satanist" remarks, which I'm willing to bet also have no basis in reality.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">People like this guy really get me steamed! Grrr...</p>

<p align="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="+1">I'd just like to address each of his points, just for the sake of doing so:</FONT></p>
<DL><DT><b>Java is a flimsy and unreliable language.</b></DT>
<DD>Okay, well, he's entitled to his opinion of the Java programming language, although I'm willing to bet that nobody at <! page="">JOS</a> agrees with this.</DD>
<DT><b>It would do more to boost the unwholesome "macintosh" computing industry, as it would be a multiple-platform OS. The less ground you give Mac users, the less this comunity is able to fester.</b></DT>
<DD>This is odd. I know lots of people who use macs (my supervisor at work being one of them). As far as I can tell, none of the ones I've met are at all "unwholesome," nor does the industry assert any "unwholesome" qualities itself.  He shouldn't extend his feelings on the platform to its developers and users.</DD>
<DT><b>The programmers working on this project are an unsavory lot. One of them, James Frasch√©, has admitted that his computer (the computer that could be responsible for the operating system that your <! page="">CHILDREN</a> might use someday) is a "gay homosexual" computer.</b></DT>
<DD>Unless James really does call his computer a "gay homosexual," I doubt that this is a valid claim and could be counted as seditious libel against James.</DD>
<DT><b>It would reduce America's dependence on our beloved computer corporation, Microsoft.</b></DT>
<DD>Ack! Although I doubt that would actually be a result of JOS, I'm not entirely sure that the end of Microsoft's monopolistic strategies in the computer industry would be such a bad thing.</DD>
<DT><b>It will be free, which will wreak havoc opon the economy.</b><DT>
<DD>I have never seen any "havoc" being wreaked upon any economy in the world by free software.  Linux is a free operating system, but it didn't "wreak havoc" anywhere, and I doubt <! page="">JOS</a> will either.</DD>
<DT><b>A certain programmer on the project goes by the alias "DigiGod," obviously a satanist reference (remember, children could be using this OS).</b></DT>
<DD>Obviously someone is drawing a bit of a drastic conclusion! By the way, I'd like to point out that the same person who seems to be in our children's interest on this page also advertises crotch-grabbing Michael Jackson dolls on his site.  Is <I>that</I> better for our children than JOS?</DD>
<DT><b>"Java" is the name of an unwholesome island nation <! page="">AND</a> the name of a potent drug-laden drink. Remember the children!</b></DT>
<DD>I know of no reason why the island of Java is unwholesome (unless I read him correctly, then I believe he means that they are "pagan," which would be a more accurate claim).  See the children remark above.</DD>
<DT><b>Satan has been know to use Java.</b></DT>
<DD>I take it he must know Satan personally or something.</DD>
<DT><b>"JOS" backwards is "SOJ".... a nonsense word!</b></DT>
<DD>And <! page="">DaveCo</a> backwards is oCevaD.</DD>
<DT><b>The <! page="">JOS</a> website features an animated "Barney."</b></DT>
<DD>I've never seen an animated Barney on the <! page="">JOS</a> site, and if there is it makes no difference to the argument against JOS!</DD>
<DT><b>Nobody is safe from virii, and the <! page="">JOS</a> programming crew is UNWHOLESOME!</b></DT>
<DD>I believe I already covered this in the remark about James above. I'd like some elaboration as to why he's calling me and us "unwholesome!" If you want unwholesome, you should see the products he advertises at <a href="http://members.aol.com/davesays/products.htm">http://members.aol.com/davesays/products.htm</a> </DD>

 A few things, I know the person who wrote this page and he doesn't work on the <! page="">JOS</a> project I think he saw the link on an online magazine.  Secondly he does this thing alot he really doesn't mean any harm by it and I being both <a href="DigiGod.html">DigiGod</a> and James Frasch√© (call me Frasch√© :)) take no offense to anything written on this page (I thought the <EM>Satan has been known to use Java</EM> quite funny). Finally he himself is a programmer who belives in free software and is learning Java (he actually can't wait to get rid of Windoze and put <! page="">JOS</a> on his computer)
</p><p>

I alwas find it fascinating how humorless people can be activated to utter moral sermons by a little bit of sarcasm. I admit that sometimes sarcasm can hurt feelings, but anybody feeling violated by a raving lunatic with obvous dreams of omnipotence has to take the blame on himself.
</p><p>
I am not at all offended by being called <! page="">UNWHOLESOME</a> to community. I don't want to be a prt of a community where humor is damned in favor of static moral structures and a free mind is chained in favor of some 'whole good' (whatever that may be).
</p><p>
I dare anybody who can take a bit of sarcasm to take a look at America's greates anti-philosopher <a href="http://rawilson.com/">Robert A. Wilson</a>.
