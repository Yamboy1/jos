<h3>An experience with <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a> Release 3 for Intel</h3>
</p><p>
First of all, I had to make sure I had all the necessary hardware to run it. They don't support a lot of it on the PC, but luckily I had just the right system to run it (for example, they only support <! page="">SoundBlaster</a> AWE64 right now, and I've got it. Also, the Matrox Mystique is one of the few supported video cards, and I've got that as well!).
</p><p>
I received it about 2 weeks after ordering it, and then proceeded to install it on my NT machine. It comes with <! page="">PartitionMagic</a>, a program to help make new partitions by making existing partitions smaller. I didn't really need PM since I was installing to a separate drive (Western Digital 1GB IDE). A very simple installation allowed me to choose my source drive containing the install files, and the destination drive (which had to be formatted with the <! page="">BFS</a> file system). The only other options were "Clean Install" (to overwrite existing settings), and "Install Optional Items." 
</p><p>
Only <b>fifteen</b> minutes later it was installed! It said to press the button to reboot into <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a>, so I did. Only trouble was, it didn't boot up! After screwing around with it for a day or so, I found that the problem seemed to be with the Western Digital... <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a> must not like it. I freed up some room on my primary drive, a Maxtor 5GB, and <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a> installed perfectly.
</p><p>
The trick with installation is to leave some space on your hard drive as unpartitioned. Then use the <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a> installer program to format it to BFS, and initialize it.
</p><p>
<b>The first thing that impressed me</b>
</p><p>
Bootup speed. It took about 10-15 seconds from the time my machine started to when the icons and windows were drawn on the desktop! (P200, 80MB ram). Normally NT server takes about 30-45 seconds to completely load (granted, it must also load some network services that I wasn't loading on <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a>).
</p><p>
<b>The Good, the Bad: The GUI</b>
</p><p>
It was nice. :) Very clean, high tech looking. The Deskbar is their equivalent to the Taskbar in Windows. I like the Deskbar better, because it only shows one listing per program. So if I had 5 web browser windows open, there was only one "Browser" listing on the Deskbar. To reach the other windows, just click the listing and a submenu pops up. Their equivalent to Windows Explorer is the Tracker. It keeps track of all windows of that type, just as other programs do.
</p><p>
Instead of minimize/maximize buttons, <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a> has one button that either fits the window to the contents, or returns it to it's "normal" size. Instead of minimizing windows, you "hide" them by double clicking on the tab (the tab is like a Title Bar in Windows, except it's only as wide as the title of the window). I didn't really like having to double click to minimize, I thought it would be nice to have a second button to do that. There is also a close button on the left side of the tab. The active window's tab is always yellow (I didn't notice a way to change that).
</p><p>
The scrollbars were configurable! I like this a lot. You could specify the minimum size for the scrollbar handle (you know how in Windows, when you're working with a really long set of data, and the handle always shrinks down to a few millimeters? Well, this fixes it!). You could specify the "ridges" on the handle (purely for show). You could also specify whether you wanted Windows style scrollbars (i.e. they have a up arrow at the top, a down arrow at the bottom), or the default <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a> style (both arrows at the top and bottom). I preferred <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a> style, since I didn't have to move around much if I wanted to go back and forth in a window.
</p><p>
The other <! page="">GUI</a> widgets seemed pretty standard to me.
</p><p>
Oh, btw, you could move the Deskbar to certain locations on screen, even making it stretch out at the top or bottom of the window to mimic the Windows95/NT style of taskbar (including the digital clock at the right hand side). This is a nice way to let people from Windows transition to <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a> without having to freak them out!
</p><p>
Other things I noticed about the <! page="">GUI</a> (good or bad):
</p><p>
<ul> <li> Desktop color could be changed easily, but the other colors were hard coded (though I hear there are 3rd party programs to change them).
<li> Instead of "shortcuts," <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a> reverts to Unix style symbolic links, which work the same way as shortcuts, with the added benefit of being able to treat them like real files within the OS (ever make a shortcut to a folder in Win95, then try to 'cd' to it from the commandline? :)
<li> The main pointer icon is a hand. I didn't see any way to change it, although it was OK to use. It didn't repulse me like the tiny red <! page="">SGI</a> pointer. :) 
<li> When you double click a file, the program to view/run it is located via <! page="">MIME</a> types, which are used extensively throughout <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a> (more on that in a bit).
<li> Video on the <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a> was <b>SMOOTH</b>! Granted, I could not find any videos to play with sound, but the quicktime movies provided with the OS never once hitched or skipped a frame (and these were 20 to 30 second videos, not 5 second animations).
</ul> 
<b>Replicants</b>
</p><p>
Replicants are so cool I decided to give them their own subtopic. :) I don't have much to say about them, because you really have to mess with them to 'get it.' Replicants are program parts that can be copied from a working program, and "pasted" to a document or program that supports replicants! Here's an example. The desktop itself can hold replicant objects. The web browser that comes with <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a> is setup so that the page viewer is a replicant. I dragged it to the desktop, closed the browser program, and was able to continue to browse the web through my desktop! :) Then I just right clicked on it, hit Delete, and that replicant vanished.
</p><p>
<b>BFS and <! page="">MIME</a> types</b>
</p><p>
<a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a> uses internet standard <! page="">MIME</a> typing throughout the system. There is a program on the Deskbar that lets you force a file to be <! page="">MIME</a> typed, and apparantly it does this by looking at the file's binary code (MAGIC header, I guess?), which is associated to a mime type somewhere within <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a>. You can add/delete/change <! page="">MIME</a> types within <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a>.
</p><p>
This fits in perfectly with their file system, BFS, which supports file "attributes." Files can have any number of attributes (sound familiar, Brad? Possible <a href="XML.html">XML</a> use maybe?? :) and those attributes can be displayed in the Tracker windows by the user (just like you can display file types, modification dates, and such in Windows). If you use .zip files to transport files from <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a>, they retain their attributes. Attributes are useful also for sorting the content in the filesystem, and searching it through <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a>'s Find program.
</p><p>
<b>Odds and Ends</b>
</p><p>
<ul> <li> The threading in this sucker is unbelievable. I only have one processor, but when I caused a program to completely peg out the processor (use 100% of the resources), I was still able to open up and move around other programs in a reasonable amount of time. Conversely, on Windows when this happens, I can hardly do anything but click somewhere and wait a few minutes for the action to take effect.
<li> <! page="">SMP</a> - I don't claim to fully understand this, but all I know is you can drop in some more processors, and <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a> will just use them. No upgrading to a multi processor version, or any of that crap. :) And what's more, a single program can utilize multiple processors, automatically (I do not think this is the case in NT).
<li> I hated the included email program, and even the Mail-It 3rd party program. This alone was enough for me to slink away to Windows where I use Eudora 4. In addition, the web browser was OK, but I can't wait for the Bezilla team to get Netscape running on <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a>.
<li> The networking seemed a little slow to me. I don't know if it was my <! page="">ISP</a> that day, or if I misconfigured my networking, but it seemed to take <! page="">FOREVER</a> to lookup hosts. Perhaps their <! page="">DNS</a> stuff is not optimized. On the flip side, networking was pretty simple to setup.
<li> It is not yet a multi-user system, but they said they have everything in place to add that to it later (if you go into the Terminal program, and do a "ls -l" command, you will see that every file is owned by a user called "baron").
</ul> 
<b>Conclusion</b>
</p><p>
I think we have a contender here folks! <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a> has some definitely new and unique features. 95% of the things lacking in it right now will likely be addressed before the public release of the OS. As it is now, it's cool but definitely still for geeks only. I think anyone working on the <! page="">JOS</a> gui should pick up a copy and learn from it.
</p><p>
<b>More?</b>
</p><p>
I'll probably add more here as I notice it. Anyone else is free to add their experiences with <a href="BeOS.html">BeOS</a> to this page...
