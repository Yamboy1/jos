The following members have been nominated as presidential candidates (see their wiki page for information on each member):
<UL> <LI> Iain Shigeoka -- <a href="IainS.html">IainS</a> -- [ <a href="mailto:iainshigeoka@yahoo.com">iainshigeoka@yahoo.com</a> ]

<STRONG>Vote Proposal</STRONG>
</P><P>
A single <! page="">JOS</a> member will become interim "President" for a period not to exceed 3 months.
</P><P>
During the interim President's term, (s)he is responsible for:
<UL> <LI> Forming and passing an "extraordinary" vote on creating a small (~3 person) "JOS cabal"  to lead the project in the future.
<LI> Set a definitive and focused road map for the <! page="">JOS</a> project (including reasonable deliverables)
<LI> Establish a single, project-wide, license for all <! page="">JOS</a> project code.
<LI> Establish a more focused short term and long term vision for the project.
<LI> Reorganize the website and other online resources to reflect the new focus of <! page="">JOS</a>
<LI> Create procedures, resources, etc to recruit new <! page="">JOS</a> members/developers, and to retain and better utilize existing <! page="">JOS</a> members.
<LI> Identify and address existing problems which is inhibiting JOS's progress, and its inability to retain and fully utilize current members.  This is the most open ended requirement for the president but probably the most important.
</UL> 
The Interim President is granted the following "extraordinary" powers to enable completion of the above duties:
<UL> <LI> Propose and "expedite" ordinary votes on the vote-info mailing list.  Many issues must be resolved and clarified during the re-organization.  For the sake of speed and project focus, the president may hold "informal" votes on the vote-info mailing lists.  These votes will be conducted as a compressed version of normal "ordinary" voting procedures.  President may make proposals for a 24 hour period (no need for seconding), and hold a vote for a 24 hour period (no quorum required).  So, during the 3 month presidency, interested members should be monitor the vote-info mailing list <EM>DAILY</EM> !
<LI> Make decisions normally requiring an "ordinary" vote.  These decisions must be followed by confirmation (or be overruled) as a vote on the vote-info mailing list (this can be an expedited vote).
<LI> Negotiate with third parties on behalf of JOS.
</UL> 
These powers essentially allow the President to act as a "benevolent dictator" within the <! page="">JOS</a> Project.  We feel that this power is required in order to effect a re-organization that will re-energize the <! page="">JOS</a> Project and provide a stronger project focus.  It is assumed that despite these powers, the President will attempt to gain consensus whenever practical and foster a sense of community and common purpose.
</P><P>
The <! page="">JOS</a> interim President may be removed at anytime by an "extraordinary" vote of the membership.
</P><P>
<EM>Why should what takes an ordinary vote to establish take an extraordinary vote to undo?  If it takes an extraordinary vote to undo, it should take an extraordinary vote to establish.  -- <a href="AveryRegier.html">AveryRegier</a></EM>

<STRONG>Vote Background</STRONG>
</P><P>
Around this time of the year three years ago on the old <a href="JavaLobby.html">JavaLobby</a> forums, the idea of creating an operating system based on the Java programming language was discussed, out of this discussion the <! page="">JOS</a> project started.
</P><P>
Now over those years the <! page="">JOS</a> project has remained quite small with the number of active contributes staying about the same.  But interest is still quite high with new people joining all the time, but there has been just as many leaving as joining.  We believe this is because there has been very little progress as a group, although some individuals have made quite a bit of progress.
</P><P>
Now we have always promoted the idea of there being multiple implementation of every component.  With the best being chosen by natural selection, but this hasn't worked each component is too strong and just won't die.  The problem with this is that the whole project will die off because new members don't know where to start and then leave.
</P><P>
So far each developer has worked on there own project with little help from other developers, and nobody wants to give up there project and work on someone else's.
</P><P>
Now for this to change we need to all stop working on our own projects and work together on a new unified project.  We should treat all the current project as prototypes and leave them behind, and just bring all the good ideas with us on the new unified project.
</P><P>
For this to succeed we need to jump into the deep-end, new mailing lists, web site, cvs server.  We can keep the old stuff around but only for reference.
</P><P>
