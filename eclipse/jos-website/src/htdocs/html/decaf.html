<b>decaf</b> is the <! page="">JVM</a> portion of the <a href="JJOS.html">JJOS</a> 'native-code runtime' that <a href="ToddMiller.html">ToddMiller</a> and <a href="JohnMorrison.html">JohnMorrison</a> (et al.) are working on.
<br>
<h3>July 3, 2000</h3>
Figured I just drop by and mention that I'm still hacking away at the decaf rewrite.  I was looking at <! page="">SableVM</a>, and got some ideas that may make it much easier to support <a href="JNI.html">JNI</a> (e.g. classpath) than I had previously suspected.
<h3>May 25, 2000</h3>
I've been working on rewriting decaf to be cleaner and more easily extensible to support some things we've been discussing on the mailing list.  In particular, after a long discussion, the summary about <a href="MultipleJavaProcesses.html">MultipleJavaProcesses</a> in a single <! page="">JVM</a> is about ready.
<br>
<h3>June 27, 1999</h3>
Long pause between updates -- if it bothered you, subsribe to the <a href="http://www.jos.org/mailman/listinfo/kernel">kernel</a> mailing list.  At any rate, there's lots of progress to report.
<ul>
<li><b>monitors</b></li> are now working;
<li><b>checkcast()</b></li> works and handles instances;
<li>java-only <b>throws</b></li> work; I'm working on native throws now.
<li><b>GRUB</b></li> didn't work for me; I hope to have time to try it again soon.
</ul>
Aside from the issue of native throws, decaf is not, to my knowledge, lacking anything from the 1.0.2 <! page="">JVM</a> spec.  I will, after completing throws, go over the specs and decaf with a fine-tooth comb to make sure of this; then I will begin integration with classpath.
<h3>May 17, 1999</h3>
Upgraded to egcs-1.1.2 for an unrelated projects, breaking large chunks of decaf in the process.  Happily (or not) JM also upgraded his system around the same time, so after we finish digesting this, we'll be in sync.  I'm expecting another few-day-long pause.
<br>
<h3>May 12, 1999</h3>
The refactored source code is available on <a href="CVS.html">CVS</a> now.  Currently on my to-do list (JM has his own):
<ul>
<li><b>monitors:</b></li> We really need these for the drivers.
<li><b>checkcast():</b></li> Forms the guts of both the checkcast and instanceof primitives; hasn't been completely ported yet.
<li><b>throws:</b></li> More for completeness than any need (yet).
<li><b>GRUB booting:</b></li> For everyone out there without two boxes to play with, this would allow JJOS/decaf to boot from a single machine.  This will probably happen before throws.
</ul>
<br>
<h3>April 29, 1999</h3>
Looks like we're on track for 'releasing' the refactored source in mid-May; lots of it will look very different, and work alot better.  We're still porting functionality from the old style to the new; only relatively minor bits remain.  The Big Thing to do before decaf is ready is to implement monitors, which we'll need to handle the new driver model.
<br>
<h3>April 18, 1999</h3>
Long delay in the updates; my apologies.  <a href="JohnMorrison.html">JohnMorrison</a> has been doing alot of refactoring work, in addition to supporting doubles &amp; longs properly; this should allow a very large leap in decaf's functionality.  I've been working on the driver architecture with <a href="MattAlbrecht.html">MattAlbrecht</a>, and making many bugfixes and adding features, most notably complete bytecode support.  Monitors, however, are not implemented as yet; likewise, <a href="JNI.html">JNI</a> (though it should follow close on the heels of <a href="JohnMorrison.html">JohnMorrison</a>'s refactoring.)
<br>
Our next major milestone should come sometime in mid to late May, after the refactoring, including a keyboard-to-console (translated) echo, monitors, double &amp; long support, as well as better support for arrays, and quite possibly a noticeable speed increase.
<h3>February 27, 1999</h3>
decaf now supports java-language hardware drivers.  A prelimary keyboard driver is included on <a href="CVS.html">CVS</a> as 'jos.system.keyboard.'
<h3>February 26, 1999</h3>
With multi-threading support back in place, and bugfixes to allow stacked .wait() calls, decaf is now at its most functional.
<br>
<h3>February 20, 1999</h3>
"gen two" of decaf is up on the CVS.  It hasn't been built back to the level of functionality that "gen one" had, but it has surpassed "gen one" in several areas already.  I expect that it will be ready to run Java device drivers in a stable fashion by March.
