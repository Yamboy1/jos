1.The Waterfall and The Cathedral
</P><P>
No matter what development process you use, all have a
foundation in the granddaddy of all life cycle models.  The
waterfall model.  It has many problems, but it serves as the
basis for other, more efficient lifecycle models.  In the
waterfall model, a project progresses through an orderly
sequence of steps from the initial software concept through
system testing.  The waterfall model is document driven,
which means the main work products that are carried from
phase to phase are documents.  These documents are reviewed
at the end of each phase to determine whether it is ready to
advance to the next phase.  The pure waterfall model
performs well when you have a stable resource base and a
stable product definition.  It provides the stability and
clear vision of the final product that developers crave.
</P><P>
The waterfall model works especially well if you have
technically weak staff or inexperience staff because it
provides the project with a structure that helps to minimize
wasted effort.  The disadvantages of the pure waterfall
model arise from the difficulty in fully specifying
requirements at the beginning of the project and its
dependency on a constant experienced resource base to drive
the process forward.
</P><P>
The waterfall development process and its derivatives have
been metaphorically described as the Cathedral.  The
Cathedral represents the monolithic nature of traditional
development with its' constant resource base and core team
leadership.
</P><P>
Adapting Cathedral development models to software projects
that have a dynamic resource base and no clear vision of the
final product, as is the case with many Internet software
projects, proves nearly impossible.  This was true until the
Bazaar style development process.
</P><P>
</P><P>
</P><P>
2.The Bazaar
</P><P>
The Bazaar style development process is demonstrated by the
most celebrated Internet software project to date.  Linux.
</P><P>
The legend began with a student of the University of
Helsinki in Finland.  His name was Linus Torvalds and he
started Linux out as a hobby in 1991.  He wanted to create a
replacement for the Minix operating system, an UNIX-like
operating system available for intel-based PCs.
</P><P>
He invited the programming community to help him create a
better Minux.  The rest is history.  Despite an undefined
resource base and a lack of a common vision other that to
"create a better Minix", Linux has been developed to the
point where it competes with commercial operating systems in
quality, features and stability.
</P><P>
</P><P>
</P><P>
Figure 2 The Bazaar
</P><P>
Note that new inputs comes from every where
</P><P>
An undefined resource base that contributes to an undefined
vision of a product characterizes the Bazaar development
model.  Each resource that contributes to the product has
their own personal vision of what they want in the product.
This is the fundamental motivation for dedicating personal
time to contribute to the product.  It also makes the
product evolve in "internet-time" because there are many
personal sub-projects that add to the whole.
</P><P>
Key to its success, however, lies with a centralized
individual or body that functions as the products core team
leadership.  This leadership filters the individual visions
into a unified vision.
</P><P>
The downside to this development model, because of a diverse
and de-centralized resource base, is the varying standards
of documentation, design and implementation.
</P><P>
Unlike the waterfall model, the Bazaar does not provide the
project with a structure that helps to minimize wasted
effort.  Without a strong central body, the product also
risks loosing direction as many personal ideas and
sub-projects are entered into the product.  And there are no
formal process of discussing and choosing a common product
vision, technology or standards.
</P><P>
3.The Guided Bazaar
</P><P>
The <! page="">JOS</a> development process is an evolutionary step in
Internet software development.  The intent is to take the
best from both the Waterfall and the Bazaar style
development models.
</P><P>
</P><P>
</P><P>
								 Figure 3 The Guided Bazaar
</P><P>
								 Note that new inputs are requested or "guided" into the <! page="">JOS</a> Project.
</P><P>
From the waterfall we take the underlying structure.
Through <! page="">RFP</a> (Request for Proposal), <! page="">RFS</a> (Request for
Specification) and other request documents, we hope to
galvanize and guide the <! page="">JOS</a> membership and outside resources
to respond with the best of breed technical solutions.  More
traditional mechanisms like documentation, specification and
coding standards that will guide technically weak
contributors to produce professional quality technology .
</P><P>
From the Bazaar we will take the ability to tap into the
ideas of the limitless resource base of the Internet
community.  However, we will have a structure that will
allow new ideas to be requested, heard, discussed and chosen
by the <! page="">JOS</a> membership.
</P><P>
</P><P>
2 The Goals of Our Process
</P><P>
The <! page="">JOS</a> Project develops and evolves <! page="">JOS</a> specifications in
"Internet-time", by using an open process that produces
high-quality specifications.
</P><P>
The five goals that drive it:  openness, web-wide
participation, speed, modularity, self-documentation,
self-tracking, technical excellence and recognition.  We
believe that this process is fundamental to JOS's success
because of the volunteer nature of free software projects.
</P><P>
2.1 Openness
</P><P>
Any person can participate in the process by simply becoming
a <! page="">JOS</a> member.  The only requirement is that they have access
to the Internet.
</P><P>
All specifications must are open, free of any constraints or
restrictions associated with intellectual property rights
(IPR).  Anyone wishing to contribute to <! page="">JOS</a> specifications
must be willing to do so without imposing <! page="">IPR</a> barriers.  We
believe strongly in fostering competition around the
technologies described by <! page="">JOS</a> specifications.  Anyone should
be able to produce a complete implementation of the
technology described by <! page="">JOS</a> specifications without cost or
red tape.
</P><P>
2.2 Web-wide participation
</P><P>
Once the individual becomes a member they have an
opportunity to review, comment on, and contribute to <! page="">JOS</a>
specifications.  The best way to do this is to participate
in the free form, dynamic <! page="">JOS</a> Collaboration Area.  Here
anyone can conduct a web-wide public review of his or her
draft specifications or position papers.  At the cost of a
simple Internet connection, our process builds consensus on
a truly international scale
</P><P>
2.3 Speed
</P><P>
Because <! page="">JOS</a> is has a volunteer workforce, it is very
important to keep tasks as short as possible.  Volunteers
have many outside forces (i.e.  Job, family, school) that
effect the amount of time spent on outside activities.  Time
constraints on steps within the process increase speed by
encouraging smaller milestones that can fit into any
schedule.
</P><P>
2.4 Modularity
</P><P>
The dynamics of a volunteer workforce dictate that the <! page="">JOS</a>
process be modular.  The process accounts for the
possibility of a developer not following a specification
through implementation.  The process divides itself into
several steps.  Each step produces a part of the
specification that can be picked up by another developer.
This insures that a specification can continue to completion
with different resources.
</P><P>
2.5 Self-Documenting
</P><P>
Because of the possibility of a developer not following a
specification through the entire process.  It is important
that each step in the process produce complete, high-quality
documentation.
</P><P>
2.6 Self-Tracking
</P><P>
Dividing the process into clearly defined steps make the
progress of a specification easily traceable.  Each step in
the <! page="">JOS</a> development process is assigned time estimation.
Metrics can be gathered to evaluate performance and fine
tune requests to meet realistic goals.
</P><P>
2.6 Technical excellence
</P><P>
We develop all <! page="">JOS</a> specifications with the active
participation of computer experts and industry leaders.  In
this way, each specification embodies best of breed
technology along with innovation that benefits every system
on which the <! page="">JOS</a> platform is implemented.  As such, no
specification will ever lock implementers or users into a
single company's proprietary technology or be tied to just
one computer processor or operating system.
</P><P>
2.7 Recognition
</P><P>
Unlike other free software projects, the <! page="">JOS</a> project
acknowledges the time spent by volunteer developers.  Any
<! page="">JOS</a> member can enter time sheets, verified by actual
contributions to the <! page="">JOS</a> project.  This time recognition can
be used to provide reference letters to potential employers
or proof of experience.

</P><P>
3 How We Develop <! page="">JOS</a>
</P><P>
The <! page="">JOS</a> Development Process is a consensus building process.
The process provides the structure for specification
development and implementation.
</P><P>
3.1 Document Naming Conventions
</P><P>
All <! page="">JOS</a> related document use the following the naming
convention:
</P><P>
JOS-XXX-0000
</P><P>
JOS-(JOS Project Identification)
</P><P>
Because all <! page="">JOS</a> documents can be published on non-JOS
related lists and newsgroups (to attract new volunteer
developers), it is necessary to relate the document to the
<! page="">JOS</a> project.
</P><P>
XXX-(JOS Document Type)
</P><P>
A three-letter abbreviation of the <! page="">JOS</a> document type, (i.e.
RFP,RFS etc..)
</P><P>
0000-(JOS Specification Track)
</P><P>
A unique number used to identify related specification
documents.  For example a JOS-RFP-0022 and JOS-RFS-0022
would be related to the same specification (0022).  The
specification track number must be assigned by the <! page="">JOS</a>
Project Coordinator at <a href="mailto:jos-admin@jos.org.">jos-admin@jos.org.</a>
</P><P>
</P><P>
3.1 Position Papers (POS)
</P><P>
A position paper is a means by which members can express
their ideas about the technology direction of JOS.  They can
be used to build member support for the idea or as a prelude
to a Request for Proposal (RFP).  It has no bearing on the
process and stands alone.  The author must request a new
identifier to publish a position paper.
</P><P>
3.2 Request for Proposal (RFP)
</P><P>
An <! page="">RFP</a> is the first step in the beginning of the <! page="">JOS</a>
process.  It is a document used to describe a general <! page="">JOS</a>
Project technology requirement.
</P><P>
The document must describe the general goals and guidelines
of the proposal including, end user characteristics, design
considerations and general constraints without being
specific.  RFPs are required to meet a proposal response
deadline of 2 to 4 weeks.
</P><P>
After requesting a new <! page="">RFP</a> identifier (0000), the <! page="">RFP</a> is
written and a response deadline is established, it is
published on the <! page="">JOS</a> web site and optionally posted to
non-JOS-related newsgroups, web sites and lists to attract
new talent to the <! page="">JOS</a> membership.
</P><P>
(See JOS-TPL-001 for detailed guidelines about RFPs.  See
JOS-TPL-002 for detailed guideline about a <! page="">RFP</a> response
proposal.)
</P><P>
All responding proposals are posted for review before
voting.  Formal input can be entered at the Review section
<! page="">JOS</a> member area of the administration site.  In the <! page="">JOS</a>
collaboration area, merits of each proposal can be discussed
in an informal forum.  This helps build consensus and allows
the proposal authors to further explain or elaborate on
ideas.
</P><P>
3.3 Request for Specification (RFS)
</P><P>
The next step after a proposal has been voted through is the
Request for Specification.  The purpose of <! page="">RFS</a> is to request
a specification document that will provide a detailed design
based on the proposal.  RFSs are required to meet a
specification response deadline of 2 to 8 weeks.
</P><P>
Along with all of the information found in the RFP, this
document must outline the basic requirements of a
specification document including design drivers, reuse
strategy, high-level diagrams, performance considerations
and overall sub-system overview.  It also must include
Javadoc documentation of interfaces, in-use sample code from
a developer's prospective and screen-shots or diagrams if
necessary.
</P><P>
After assigning the same identifier (0000) as the <! page="">RFP</a> to the
RFS, the <! page="">RFS</a> is written and a response deadline is
established, it is published on the <! page="">JOS</a> web site and
optionally posted to non-JOS related newsgroups, web sites
and lists to attract new talent to the <! page="">JOS</a> membership.
</P><P>
(See JOS-TPL-003 for detailed guidelines about RFSs.  See
JOS-TPL-004 for detailed guideline about a <! page="">RFS</a> response
specification document.)
</P><P>
All responding specification documents are posted for review
before voting.  Formal input can be entered at the Review
section <! page="">JOS</a> member area of the administration site.  In the
<! page="">JOS</a> collaboration area, merits of each specification can be
discussed in an informal forum.  This helps build consensus
and allows the proposal authors to further explain or
elaborate on ideas.
</P><P>
3.4 Request for Implementation (RFI)
</P><P>
After a proposal has been created and a specification
document has been created the next step is to create an
implementation.  The implementation is actual Java or C/C++
code that will be integrated into the current <! page="">JOS</a> code base.
The <! page="">RFP</a> is a document that specifies the requirements for
implementing a RFS.
</P><P>
Along with all of the information provided in the <! page="">RFP</a> and
<! page="">RFS</a> the response to the <! page="">RFI</a> will include an archive (*.zip,
*.tgz) of source code, binaries, build script, test suite
and any additional documentation.  ( see <! page="">JOS</a> Implementation
Guidelines JOS-DOC-002)
</P><P>
After assigning the same identifier (0000) as the RFP, <! page="">RFS</a>
to the RFS, the <! page="">RFS</a> is written and a response deadline is
established, it is published on the <! page="">JOS</a> web site and
optionally posted to non-JOS related newsgroups, web sites
and lists to attract new talent to the <! page="">JOS</a> membership.
</P><P>
(See JOS-TPL-005 for detailed guidelines about RFIs.  See
JOS-TPL-006 for detailed guideline about a <! page="">RFI</a> response
specification document.)
</P><P>
All responding specification documents and source code are
assigned a Submission ID (SMT) and a revision number and
posted for review and testing before voting.  Formal input
and testing/quality results can be entered at the Review
section <! page="">JOS</a> member area of the administration site.  In the
<! page="">JOS</a> collaboration area, merits of each implementation can be
discussed in an informal forum.  This helps build consensus
and allows the implementation authors to further explain or
elaborate on ideas.
</P><P>
3.5 Request for Change (RFC)
</P><P>
The RFC's purpose is to provide a mechanism to request a
change in an approved <! page="">JOS</a> specification.  Used to describe a
change in a general <! page="">JOS</a> Project technology specification.
The document can describe the general goals and guidelines
of the change including, end user characteristics, design
considerations and general constraints without being
specific.  RFCs are not used to correct mistakes.  They are
used to change a technology direction.  RFCs are required to
meet a proposal response deadline of 2 to 4 weeks.
</P><P>
After assigning a unique identifier (0000) to the RFC, the
<! page="">RFC</a> is written and it is published to the <! page="">JOS</a> web site for
review.  The <! page="">JOS</a> community with the voting process must
approve the RFC.  If the <! page="">RFC</a> passes the vote then it moves
into the RFP(see section 3.2) stage.
</P><P>
(See JOS-TPL-007 for detailed guidelines about RFCs.)
</P><P>
3.6 Request for Action (RFA)
</P><P>
The RFA's purpose is to provide a mechanism to galvanize the
<! page="">JOS</a> membership to solve a <! page="">JOS</a> process or organizational
related problem.
</P><P>
For example:
</P><P>
A new Perl script needs to be written for the <! page="">JOS</a> web site
Testing tools for the <! page="">JOS</a> development kit need to be
written.  Documentation for a <! page="">JOS</a> sub-process needs to be
written.
</P><P>
After assigning a unique identifier (0000) to the RFA, the
<! page="">RFA</a> is written and it is published to the <! page="">JOS</a> web site for
review.  The <! page="">RFA</a> must be approved by the <! page="">JOS</a> community by
the voting process.
</P><P>
(See JOS-TPL-008 for detailed guidelines about RFAs.)
</P><P>
3.7 Submission
</P><P>
All responses to RFPs,RFS etc.. must follow minimum
guidelines to be considered for review and voting.  These
guidelines are outlined in templates for the respective
document types.
