<a href="JosCommunicationBusArchitecture.html">JosCommunicationBusArchitecture</a> and <a href="StefansAPIStructureProposal.html">StefansAPIStructureProposal</a> both define <! page="">JOS</a> specific classes/interfaces. They prefix each name with "Jos": <! page="">JosServiceRegistry</a>, <! page="">JosConnectionPublisher</a>, ...
</p><p>
Do you think this is necessary? Or should the <! page="">JOS</a> API classes be named <! page="">ServiceRegistry</a>, <! page="">ConnectionPublisher</a>, etc.? (Note: We're speaking of the "exposed" <! page="">JOS</a> classes only, not internal ones.)
</p><p>
Advantages of the prefix are:
<ul> <li> use of <! page="">JOS</a> classes instantly recognizable in a source text
<li> programmers always know whether they write classes for external or internal use (see <a href=#mn_converted>Michael Nygard's thoughts</a> below)
<li> name clashes averted (conflicts with identically named classes in another package)
</ul> 
Disadvantages are:
<ul> <li> lengthy names - 3 extra characters to type
<li> Name clash is never completely averted (if another package has <! page="">JosXxx</a> this model serves no purpose
<li> If Sun decides to name one of its classes <! page="">JosSomething</a>.  We cannot do the same and thus breaks the model.
<li> We commit to the notion that there we should have exposed interfaces. [AveryRegier]
<li> A proliferation of "JOS" prefixed classes makes the prefix meaningless. [AveryRegier]
</ul> 
What is your opinion? "Jos" prefix or not? Please answer on this page, so we can decide democratically (it's the first time we do that at JOS, isn't it?).

</p><p>
My vote is NO.  <! page="">JOS</a> system classes &amp; interfaces will be identified as <! page="">JOS</a> specific by their package names.  Adding "JOS" to the start of each class is simply redundant.  Naming conflicts in other packages is handled in Java by the requirement that if two classes in different packages have the same name, and you import both packages, you must simply specify the full package name in the class file.
</p><p>

</p><p>
My vote is YES. Naming conflicts are not a problem because of the reasons Avery has pointed out. However, I believe it is worth doing simply because of clarity. If you are reading someone elses source code and are unfamiliar with the classes defined by JOS, it would be a real pain to determine whether a particular class has been defined in "org.jos.<STRONG>", or "com.wibble.</STRONG>". Prefixing with "Jos", is not a lot extra to type and makes it instantly recognizable that this is a <! page="">JOS</a> class.

I agree with Matthew.  The Jos is very simple to tack on, and as these  classes may very well be used outside of the <! page="">JOS</a> project it is also nice to be able to identify their use by name.  It isn't a big deal really, and whether we put the Jos on there or not could also be left up to the coder.  I think that as long as your code works, you can call it anything you want to.
</p><p>

</p><p>
NO.  As Avery states, the package names are sufficient to distinguish
<! page="">JOS</a> classes from other classes.  The extra prefix is just clutter.
I also think the argument about "knowing" they are <! page="">JOS</a> classes is
flawed.  Can you use any <a href="API.html">API</a> without knowing the classes?  In any
development environment more sophisticated than "vi", you can always
jump from the class name in use to its definition.
Consider an analogous situation: When you import classes from JGL,
KLGroup, or IBM, they have no prefix on every class name.  Instead,
they rely on the package name to disambiguate the name.  We should
definitely do the same.
</p><p>
(BTW, I expected more responses.  I guess most of us in the US are
a little distracted today. (For non-US people, its tax day here.

There can be instances where package de-ambiguity of class names is not enough.  For example, say I write a class called a Registry, however in another package somewhere(that I am using) there is another object called Registry, well look at my situation now, I have to completely qualify my use of Registry (or at least one use of Registry) and if I tried to import both packages I suppose when I created an instance of a Registry it woulc create one based on the first package imported(based on the assumption that the packages are parsed in the same order they are imported).  So a <! page="">JosRegistry</a> and a Registry could be used happily together, for ever more.  I know things like this don't happen much, but why take the chance?  Are three letters really that much of a hassle?
</p><p>
And agreed on that last comment Michael, when you see nested parens in someone's statment you can generally assume they are a coder, in my experience.

Michael states - <i>"Can you use any <a href="API.html">API</a> without knowing the classes?"</i>. The answer is you cannot <i>write</i> code without knowing the API. However it is quite possible that you may <i>read</i> code without knowing that API. Hopefully the <! page="">JOS</a> API will have class names that suggest what they do. Adding the <! page="">JOS</a> prefix, clarifies further the intended function of the class.

NO. I hate typing
--DigiGod 16 April 1998
<hr>
NO.  Since I am the guy who initally started this debate with Stefan, let me restate my issues here
<ol>
<li>  These extra characters provide only a false sense of security in terms of unambiguous names since if we have org.jos.foo.JosRegistry and  org.jos.bar.JosRegistry then nothing has been solved.
<li>  Readability is not enhanced since any application that uses <! page="">JOS</a> classes will be using them a lot and so a <! page="">JosThis</a> and a <! page="">JosThat</a> strewn all over the place does no buy the programmer anything.  Please make good class names to better inform the users.
<li> If for some reason, in the next JDK, sun has the prefix Jos or <! page="">JOS</a> for any one of their classes, then guess who has to make changes.  This will break our naming consistency.  Granted that it is not a common occurance this is still an issue.
<li>  Java's way of packaging is probably the best way of doing things.  Packages + classes.  I am sure Sun will make all necessary changes in the language to fix any shortcomings with this design.
<li>It will resemble the microsoft <! page="">MFC</a> hierarchy (CObject). Need I say more?

The idea I had in mind when I introduced the prefix was to stress the org.jos.api classes' special character. They are all abstract, but know where an implementation is found.
</p><p>
So, when you see a class named "Jos...," you know that an implementation has to be registered before the class can be used.
</p><p>
The org.jos.api classes are special in another way: they are the only <! page="">JOS</a> classes visible to applications. It's an easy rule to remember: classes with arbitrary names are JOS-internal and can be changed between releases; classes starting with "Jos" belong to the <a href="API.html">API</a> and have to conform to certain rules (<a href="StefansAPIStructureProposal.html">StefansAPIStructureProposal</a>) in order to ensure backwards compatibility.
</p><p>
These are all "psychological" reasons. But what do you expect, class names are for humans, not for machines.
</p><p>
Despite the current majority against the prefix, I'm still very much in favor of it.

YES, definitely! It makes more sense having the <! page="">JOS</a> in the class name instead of only having it in the package. When you talk about the System class or the <! page="">SecurityManager</a> you obviously mean the one located in java.lang. However, with JOS, how will you refer to it? You will say the <! page="">JOS</a> System and the <! page="">JOS</a> <! page="">SecurityManager</a>. So, for reasons of clarity and ease of use, we put the <! page="">JOS</a> there. And trust me, developers spend more time thinking and browsing the Web for specifications and algorithms than typing in code. And we have visual editors if it's that tiring!

Wow! What to do, what to do? There are lots of compelling arguments going both ways. I say <b>yes</b>, for several reasons:
</p><p>
<ul> <li> Stefan points out we're only talking about the exposed classes, in org.jos.api. If we were talking about having to do this on our internal classes, I would say let's not bother.
<li> Alexis's comment about the System and <! page="">SecurityManager</a> classes belonging to java.lang really hits home. Those are just two examples of classes that are popular in java.lang.*, but are common enough names where we might use them.
<li> And the most compelling reason to me is that the only negative I can think of is typing 3 extra characters. 
</ul> 
True, it will be redundant when you're looking at the class list or API, but reading/writing the code will be where most people see the class names.
</p><p>
<b>However</b>, all that being said, I really don't think it matters one way or the other. The important thing is to pick a way and stick with it. If we DO go with it, then OK. If we DON'T go with it, then that's fine too, but we'll just have to use full package names when in need of clarity. So, I vote YES.
</p><p>

<a name=mn_converted></a>
<hr>
</p><p>
Hmmm.  Well.  This is a more subtle issue than I originally thought.  Reading the statements from Alexis and Stefan, which emphasize that these mark the exposed classes got me thinking about this issue all over again.  As a result, I'm changing my vote to YES.  Here's why:
</p><p>
When crafting an API, you must consider both sides of the interface.  From the clients' perspective, the extra characters might be clutter, or they might be useful.  That would seem to be largely a matter of taste.  From the implementers' perspective, however, things are a little different.  One of the most difficult parts of constructing a solid <a href="API.html">API</a> is maintaining discipline.  Sometimes, classes will sneak out from behind your interface and become unintentionally visible.  Other times, the implementer might be tempted to take shortcuts in a classes interface, or change existing methods to be more consistent with the evolution of an API.  (I know we've all done it.)  Obviously, a system <a href="API.html">API</a> had better be much more stable than your typical internal interfaces.
</p><p>
All of which leads me to this point: While the "Jos" prefix might be of debatable value to the clients of an API, it serves as a marker to remind the implementer to maintain discipline.  If I am working on <EM>anything</EM> named "Jos*", I know that changes to the interface must never be made lightly.
</p><p>
In addition, if I take over a package with dozens of classes, it will be apparent which ones are meant to be exposed. (The "public" access specifier is not enough; in many cases classes must be public for implementation reasons, not because they should be exposed.)
</p><p>
An interesting debate!
</p><p>
-Michael Nygard, 21 April 1998
</p><p>
<hr>
Thank you, Michael, for completing what I started! You clarified what I wanted to say.
</p><p>
The essential point is actually that all "public" classes (and only them) are to carry the prefix. ("public" not as a Java keyword, but in the sense of "visible to applications.")
</p><p>
--StefanReich, 22-Apr-98
</p><p>
<hr>
I'm changing my vote to YES.  I can see how the prefix will serve to create a 'namespace' which serves a variety of purposes (which others have outlined) and there is no easy other way to create such a 'namespace' in java.  When done (and if <! page="">YES</a> wins) someone might clearly wrap up what specific conditions should hold to use the prefix. And we'll have to stick to the conditions strictly or lose the benefits we gained.
</p><p>
-- <! page="">StephenMarney</a>, 24-Apr-98 
</p><p>
<hr>
After seeing what the restrictions proposed for putting "JOS" at the start of a class name, I am leaning towards yes for those very limited purposes only.  However, I am still voting NO for what most of you will consider to be a tangential discussion not directly applicable to the topic at hand, but will be affected by the outcome of this vote.  
</p><p>
If we say 'yes' to putting "JOS" at the start of every <STRONG>exposed</STRONG> interface, then we have effectively approved the notion that <! page="">JOS</a> should have exposed interfaces.  It is my position that the only place where these 'exposed' interfaces should be used is in the implementation of the <! page="">JavaPlatform</a> itself, (i.e.  java.<STRONG>, and javax.</STRONG>) and the implementation of <! page="">JOS</a> specific code which we distribute.  (And a further limitation being that the only code we write which uses such exposed interfaces will either not have a user interface, or would specifically be for the purpose of exposing a part of the OS as a system utility (such as a <! page="">CodeRepositoryViewer</a>, which would need access to the <! page="">CodeRepository</a> interfaces)).  The thing I want to be careful of is that applications meant to be run on any implementation of the <! page="">JavaPlatform</a> not use these exposed <! page="">JOS</a> interfaces.
</p><p>
In short, I can agree with "JOS" being prefixed to exposed interfaces, only so long as the things which these interfaces are exposed to meet the above criteria.  I would further add, however, that our code which uses the exposed interfaces in this manner is going to, by nature, use so much of our internal classes that "JOS" is going to need to be prefixed to most of the classes that we write.
</p><p>
So, my vote is still <STRONG>NO</STRONG> until the above conditions are met and my fear of "JOS" being prefixed to everything we write is allayed.  Of course, with the vote very much in favor of yes, I doubt that is much of a roadblock. :)

Stephen, there is a set of (pretty precise) rules that Jos... interfaces must conform to: see <a href="StefansAPIStructureProposal.html">StefansAPIStructureProposal</a>. Is this what you meant or am I getting you wrong?
</p><p>
Avery, sometimes we <! page="">MUST</a> define our own interface to applications. There is so much missing in java.<STRONG>. One example is the <a href="JosScout.html">JosScout</a> (a regular <! page="">JOS</a> application) that needs to "listen" to the file system, that is, get notified when files are created, moved etc. Such a feature is not present in java.</STRONG>. So we have to create a new interface.
</p><p>
Then, where put it? We have two possibilities: javax.* (an interesting idea; who controls/owns javax.<STRONG>? Is it free?) or org.jos.api.</STRONG>.
</p><p>
I don't agree that most of the classes belonging to <! page="">JOS</a> will carry the prefix. I think it will be less than, say, 10% or even 5%. The idea is to keep the <a href="API.html">API</a> lean. The "workhorse" classes are not public.
</p><p>
Does this meet the requirements for your "NO->YES" conversion, Avery? ;-)

I propose placing all interfaces as static inner interfaces in a
single abstract class like the following:
<blockquote>
package org.jos.api;
public abstract class <! page="">JOS</a>
{
  public static interface APIRegistry
  {
	 ...
  }
  ...
}
</blockquote>
In this scheme, there are three ways to name an interface:
1. the full name:
<blockquote>
	class <! page="">XXX</a> implements org.jos.api.JOS.APIRegistry
</blockquote>
2. via the containing class:
<blockquote>
	import org.jos.api.JOS;
	class <! page="">XXX</a> implements JOS.APIRegistry
</blockquote>
3. import the containing class:
<blockquote>
	import org.jos.api.JOS.*;
	class <! page="">XXX</a> implements APIRegistry
</blockquote>
This gives you the flexibility of show the prefix if you want to
clarify your code and hide it if the context is clear. The only 
down side is that all interfaces are defined in the same file.
Fortunately this file will not be changed often.

For that, I vote YES.  Then again, maybe the confusion is all mine.
--BenKnowles 16 July 98
<hr>
I vote <! page="">YES</a> for the prefix. However i would like to raise a minor additional point. Since the Java language is case sensitive there's a difference between the "JOS" and the "Jos" prefix. People on this page seem to have used both interchangeably.<br>
I would prefer to have the "JOS" prefix (standing for Java Operating System or whatever) than "Jos" (it reminds me too much of Jos Verstappen ;-).
--RanieriArgentini September 18, 1998
<hr>
No. I struggled with the very thing in my own work, and have found no point to it.
jos classes already have their own packages, and don't need to be prefixed. One point was name conflicts. On the small chance that a conflick occures, an explicit reference can be used.
</p><p>
e.g.
orj.jos.Registry
com.jmonkey.Registry
</p><p>
<ul> <li> You can import Registry at the begining of your file, but it is unlikely you would be importing both registry classes.
<li> If on the off chance you are importing both, you can reference the one you require with an absolute name (include the package with the class name), and you don't even need to import it.
<li> Each name in the java Language takes up memory, the longer the name, the more memory (I've got a good reference on this, I'll append it when I find it).
<li> The design and extensibility of the <! page="">JOS</a> Arcitecture should be able to make it clear what class is what. Relaying on the name of a class for in-code identification is really ignoring our responsibility to create a good design.
</ul> 
So, if we must use a prefix, lets keep it short and sweet and use it sparingly. i.e. Sun used J<I>name</I> for Swing... however this is a case where it was a good idea, because it is likely you would be mixing <! page="">AWT</a> and <! page="">SWING</a> components.
