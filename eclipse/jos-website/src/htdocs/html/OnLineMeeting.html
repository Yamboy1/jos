<p>
We will be experimenting with some sort of on-line chat to
assist development and management of the JOS.  This
chat forum will be mud-like.
</p><p>
<ul> <li> Do we have enough to discuss?
</ul> 
We have plenty to discuss... kernel items, licensing,
infrastructure concerns, political items, legal concerns,
project status, brainstorming, project ideas, the weather, ...
</p><p>
<ul> <li> Why chat?  Why not e-mail or wiki
</ul> 
E-Mail provides a great forum for ideas to be posted and
batted back and forth when no immediate response is
required.  The wiki is great for long term living documents
that can be continuously revised.  Both are poor for
brainstorming, consensus building, etc.
</p><p>
<ul> <li> What kinds of chats?
</ul> 
There are many ways to run chats.  Hopefully the on-line
meeting solution would not impose any structure unless it is
absolutely required.  Some meetings, particularly those where
a large number of people need to be present, must be very
quick and efficient.  To do so, those types of meetings will
have the most rigorous structure, including agendas and a
standardized time.  Small design meetings among a limited
set of people can be very free form.
</p><p>
<ul> <li> Why standardize on a time?
</ul> 
For some key meetings where a great deal of structure is
needed, a standardized time will be set.  This is absolutely
needed so that every individual has a equal chance to voice
(or rather type) their opinion and ideas, provide feedback,
join solid brainstorms, raise concerns, build consensus
on key items that may concern a significant body of members.
</p><p>
For smaller, group level meetings each group is welcome and
encouraged to use the facility with or without a standardized
or pre-announced time.
</p><p>
<ul> <li> Big Opportunity: Guest Speakers
</ul> 
We have some serious opportunities that will come and go if
we do not grab hold of them.  Having guest speakers is one
such opportunity.  Many of our weekly meetings will involve
one or more guest speakers.  For instance, in a few weeks
we might have Ralph Johnson give a quick talk about design
patterns.  Or we might invite Rick Ross to talk about Java
developments.  We might have a meeting with big name
people in the free/public licensing business.  Possibly
Andy Tannenbaum will show up.  Who knows?  Bill Gates
might pop in one day to say hi.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<ul> <li> Do I have to attend these so-called "key" meetings?
</ul> 
Requested, not mandatory.  There will be agendas and minutes.
</p><p>
We all have stuff to do.  Not everyone is expected to make
all meetings.  To help you make the decision, an agenda will
be posted (at least) 3 days prior to the meeting.  Usually,
most agenda items will be filled in several weeks in advance
to provide ample time for discussion on the lists and
mini-meetings before we all get together.  Each key meeting
will be recorded and minutes will be written up and posted.
If you have points to make for a meeting that you cannot
attend, you can write a one paragraph commentary which will
be "typed" during the meeting for all to see, these
commentaries should be sent to the active chair in question.
</p><p>
<ul> <li> What technology will we use?
</ul> 
We will be using a mud, specifically the <a href="DiscWorld.html">DiscWorld</a> mud-lib.
</p><p>
A mud is the minimum technology that allows many people to
participate.  It will involve telnet to port 4242 of a
selected server.  Telnet is a widely known and supported
standard on Mac, Windows, and Unix.
</p><p>
Some companies might not let you telnet to a server
using a port other than 21.  We can have official
letters sent to the appropriate people in your company
describing the process and how you are devoting your "spare"
time to the <! page="">JOS</a> effort.  It should not be hard to 
get an exception for a free operating system.  If not,
we can create a list of supporting companies who will. :)
</p><p>
<ul> <li> Why not IRC, IQC, or other chat server?
</ul> 
They do not have soul and they are not programmable.
</p><p>
A mud is fully programmable, if we don't like the
environment we can change it to fit our needs.  Allot to be
said about this.
</p><p>
<ul> <li> What do you mean by soul?
</ul> 
Glad you asked.  Soul is something that we have in person to
person meetings.  We can see when the other person is happy,
sad, disturbed, angry, or has any other emotion to what we
do or say.  Most chat servers do not even attempt to model
"soul".  At least some muds, including <a href="DiscWorld.html">DiscWorld</a> try.  It is
important to have soul in our project... working without seeing
each other is hard.  Working together without soul... impossible.
</p><p>
Meetings take a completely different form when soul is
involved.  Instead of saying "gosh that's great" you would
"bing excitedly".. need I say more.  By simply typing
"frown" you let everyone in the room (and no one out side
the room) know that you are currently not happy about
something.  Powerful stuff.
</p><p>
<ul> <li> A virtual home
</ul> 
Every <! page="">JOS</a> member will also be given a room that they are
free to decorate as they see fit.  They can give personal
descriptions of themselves, etc.  If you can figure out how
to login all day long (telnet is a pretty thin client) you
can sit idle in your room, your team's workroom, the living
room, the entry way, or a small closet with your favorite
stuffed animal.
</p><p>
It's important that we simulate the realworld as much as we
can.  Community counts.  Environment counts.  You count.  We
want you to participate as a person.... complete with you
feelings, not just as an un-seen coder.
</p><p>
I hope this gels... if it doesn't, try it when things get
rolling.  You will see... if not, give me a holler... and
we'll hang out some.

It would be interesting if we could have
an on-line meeting.  <a href="ICQ.html">ICQ</a> has public rooms.
What do you think?
</p><p>
<hr>
</p><p>
Sounds cool, but why not IRC? Say, efnet #jos? I mean,
<a href="ICQ.html">ICQ</a> isn't available on unix, right? I'm sure there are
quite a few here that use unix, and <! page="">IRC</a> is pretty
accessible to everyone...

Can we meet at a web-site that has a Java or Web-based chat system?  I usually log in from Unix-based network computers at my school, and it would be easiest if we just employed some websites chat capabilities, maybe like Excite chat or something.
</p><p>

An online meeting is a great idea! I agree with Brad, Java or HTML-based is the best solution.
</p><p>
What about time zones? Some <! page="">JOS</a> members are in Germany, others in the US, others probably all over the world. For the first two parties, about 21h (Greenwich time) would be an acceptable time.
</p><p>

I was thinking about using <a href="DiscWorld.html">DiscWorld</a>...  www.imaginary.com
There is a java/http client.
</p><p>
Good idea, 21h <! page="">GMT</a> = 16h (4PM) <! page="">EST</a> = 12h (noon) PST.
</p><p>
How does that fit with people down under?
</p><p>

Actually 4pm <! page="">EST</a> would be 1pm PST. I only know this 'cause my boss is in California and I'm in Florida. :) 4pm's ok with me... What time would that be in Germany and down under?

I think it's pretty cool that we have to sync time zones! I've never worked on such an international project before.  What day of the week would this be, so that I can get the notes if I have to skip a class?  If we decide on a time &amp; date, maybe we can add a new small billboard to the Main page called <! page="">JOS</a> Meetings, with something like this:
</p><p>
<CENTER><table <! page="">BORDER</a> ROWS=2 WIDTH=270>
<tr><td><CENTER>JOS Meeting Billboard:<br>
<I>All meetings held at <a href="DiscWorld.html">DiscWorld</a> at www.imaginary.com</I></CENTER>
</tr></td><tr><td>General meeting on 2/##/98<br>
GMT: ###  Eastern Time: ###  Pacific Time: ###
</tr></td></table></CENTER>
etc. etc.  Is it possible to query some server on the internet and have it return all of these different time zones for us automatically, given a certain GMT?  Perhaps we can throw together a small Perl script that will print out all of the times for a given GMT:
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.jos.org?GMT=21h">http://www.jos.org?GMT=21h</a>
</p><p>
which would dynamically create a page listing all of the different Eastern times, Pacific, Mountain, etc.

Who has some experience with Chat/MUD systems and can arrange a meeting room for us?

Give me two days... to set up the environment.
<! page="">PinkFish</a> has vounenteered a mud host that we
can share with many other groups.  Once I get
some preliminary virtual rooms up, I'll
post the address and announce it!
Thank <! page="">PinkFish</a>
