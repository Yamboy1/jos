<h1>Partial working draft: Security in <! page="">JOS</a> - Addressing the security problems of an object-oriented system running
in a single-address space with focus on Java(tm)</h1>
<p>
<h2>The requirements</h2>
</p><p>
<ol>
		  <li>Several "processes" running in <! page="">JOS</a> need to be protected from each other
		  <li>Accounting of the memory and <! page="">CPU</a> usage of "processes" and possibly limiting these resources
		  <li>General "multi-user like" security needs to be provided for access control to other restricted objects
</ol>
</p><p>
<h2>Analyzation of the current state-of-the-art in Java without additional protection measures</h2>
</p><p>
<ul>
		  <li>ThreadGroups allow the grouping of several Threads or <! page="">ThreadGroups</a> all belonging to one "process"
		  (addresses 1.-3. - proof later)
		  <li>It's not possible for a "process" to access other "processes'" memory without obtaining
		  an object reference (addresses 1.)
		  <li>Java's static methods and fields are the only exception of this rule (problem for 1.)
		  <li>Due to the bad design of the already existing Java APIs, which assume "<EM>one program - one VM</EM>"
		  we cannot let this problem be solved by application developers (problem for 1.)
		  <li>Access Control is done by a <! page="">SecurityManager</a> which is responsible for the whole VM (addresses 3.)
</ul>
</p><p>
<h2>Proposed basic design to fullfil the requirements</h2>
</p><p>
<ul>
		  <li>Conflicts have to be removed from static fields/methods (solves 1.) (there are several possible approaches,
		  so I'll describe it later)
		  <li>An extension to <! page="">ThreadGroups</a> are used to provide accounting/limitations on resources (solves 2.)
		  <li>A sophisticated <! page="">SecurityManager</a> must be created to provide access control on resources (solves 3.)
</ul>
</p><p>
<p>
<h2>Details on the design and possible implementations</h2>
<h3>The problem of static methods/fields</h3>
<p>Static methods/fields (also known as class methods/fields) are accessible from everywhere in the VM, because
they do not need an object reference (which is obvious :). There are several different cases where problems could
arise.
</p><p>
<ol>
		  <li>The unthoughtful usage of static methods/fields in applications
		  <li>Some design mistakes in Java's standard API, where Sun(tm)'s engineers wrongfully assumed that only one application
		  is running in a VM (e.g. the System class)
</ol>
</p><p>
<p><b>A possible approach for a solution<br>
</b>I tried to analyze the usage of static fields in the Java 1.1 <a href="API.html">API</a> (as described in the <a href="API.html">API</a> definition), and
came to the conclusion, that only System.in and System.out were problematic. The usage of static methods is not
really a problem, because either a) calling them has no impact on the rest of the system (e.g. Integer.parseInt)
or b) the methods may be implemented so that "system-wide" changes will only affect the "process
context". Please correct me, if I've missed something important. So we can consider problem 2 solved.<br>
For problem 1 there are several possible approaches. Either we ignore this problem and leave security to the application
developer, or the <! page="">ClassLoader</a> verifies the bytecode at load time to ensure that there are no forbidden calls (criteria
for this are needed), or we take up the suggestion that the <! page="">ClassLoader</a> creates a new namespace for all static
calls (hmm...would increase memory consumption and make everything a bit more complicated).</p>
<h3>Using <! page="">ThreadGroups</a> as a replacement for "processses"</h3>
<p>All Threads belonging to a program could be placed in a <! page="">ThreadGroup</a>. <! page="">JOS</a> security will prevent applications
from accessing/modifying their own <! page="">ThreadGroup</a>. <! page="">ThreadGroup</a>'s functionality needs to be increased to support real
limitations upon memory/CPU usage. A <! page="">ThreadGroup</a> could also serve as "parent object" for the "caller
stack security model" I will describe later. Others suggested to introduction of "Application contexts"
or "Process contexts", but these are basically just synonyms for my extended <! page="">ThreadGroups</a>. We can agree
on the name later.</p>
</p><p>
<p><b>CPU time accounting</b><br>
For this model to work, Threads will always need to be created in the appropriate <! page="">ThreadGroup</a>. E.g. an <! page="">AWT</a> Repaint
Thread, even if started by the system, needs to be put in the applications' <! page="">ThreadGroup</a> which is painted, so that
the painting time is accounted to the application, not the system. This should be flawless, as long as while creating
JOS, we keep in mind to put everything into the appropriate <! page="">ThreadGroup</a>. Our <! page="">SecurityManager</a> will only allow the
creation of Threads somewhere in that applications' <! page="">ThreadGroup</a> hierarchy. (small note to people not familiar with
the Java API: <! page="">ThreadGroups</a> may also contain other <! page="">ThreadGroups</a> as well as single Threads).</p>
</p><p>
<p><b>Memory accounting<br>
</b>It's difficult to track which object was created in an object-oriented system by which other object and why.
Therefore I suggest doing a compromise and also use the <! page="">ThreadGroups</a> to do memory accounting. The memory space
consumed by objects creating during a <! page="">ThreadGroups</a> execution time are accounted to that <! page="">ThreadGroup</a>. That's still
not 100% fair in case of shared code, but it's a beginning.</p>
</p><p>
<p></p>
<h3>The "caller stack security" - an approach from the <a href="MUD.html">MUD</a> world</h3>
<p>In an object-oriented system, with reusability in mind, objects will have to call other objects of which they
do not know 100% if they are to be trusted. So we will need to scale access rights security down to the object
level. I find the "caller stack security" approach, which is in use in the LP Mud world for years now,
very usable. It basically works that way, that if a restricted action is tried to be executed, the whole stack
of calling objects is traced back to the object with the least amount of security rights which are then used for
executing this action. We will need a "parent" object for this model, so I suggest that a program's <! page="">ThreadGroup</a>
should be used as the parent object. The <! page="">ThreadGroup</a> could have some sort of User object attached to it, which
represents a "real user", and knows about that users basic access rights. Sometimes, an object which
is part of <! page="">JOS</a> itself will need to have better rights than the calling objects. In this case, the <! page="">JOS</a> system may
do a so called "unguarded" call, which basically deletes all entries in the current caller stack and
therefore allows to restart with the system's access rights. The usage of "unguarded" calls is limited
to a trusted part of the <! page="">JOS</a> core system.</p>
</p><p>
<p><b>Why is this really useful?<br>
</b>On the first look, the security achieved by this model can be achieved with a less costly model. But utilizing
this model from the very beginning puts our system on rather "safe feet" and allows adding rather nifty
security features later on.<br>
Imagine this:<br>
A composed document incorporating <a href="JavaBeans.html">JavaBeans</a> code for some really nice rendering of something is provided from User
A with very few access rights to User B with almost all access rights. User A could have modified the <a href="JavaBeans.html">JavaBeans</a>
code to be some sort of "Trojan Horse" to get something similar to "root" access to the machine
User B controls. But because the security is object-based, the incorporated <a href="JavaBeans.html">JavaBeans</a> objects will have more restrictive
access rights than User B, and so the caller stack security will prevent User A from obtaining "root"
access. Maybe this example was not that good, because similar stuff could be achieved by letting the <a href="JavaBeans.html">JavaBeans</a>
running in some sort of sandbox, but my intuition tells me, that having object-level security would be wise. An
argument <EM>for </EM>object-level security and against the sandbox approach would be, that you would have to setup
a new sandbox for basically everything. I need your opinions on that.</p>
</p><p>
<p>Of course there's still the open question on how to make this process transparent and really usable to end users.</p>
</p><p>

<hr>
</p><p>
<a href="JavaSoft.html">JavaSoft</a>'s <! page="">JDK</a> 1.2 Security Specification seems to be almost at the same approach, so this draft should adapt a bit.
</p><p>
But, do we have to do more than one event-handling thread (for every process/ user with a different security-domain)?
This would mean, every callback thread (like event-handler and with <a href="API.html">API</a> 1.2 also printer) must reside in every security domain.
</p><p>
Btw, who is the author of this draft?
