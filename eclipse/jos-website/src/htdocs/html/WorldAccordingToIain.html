<EM>Recently, the following message was posted to the jos-general mailing list by <a href="IainS.html">IainS</a>.</EM>
<h4>The World According to Iain...</h4>
In the interest of expediting things I'll put out the "World according 
to Iain" as a strawman proposal. Just my take on the situation, layout a 
possible action plan, and give us something to poke at.
<ul> <li> Note 1: I'm only going to send this via email as my net connection is a bit limited right now.  If someone wants to plaster this into the Wiki somewhere that would be great too.
<li> Note 2:  "expedite" as I feel time is of the essence.  The school year is about to begin (I've been out of school for a mere year so my body still feels the "back to school" pull... and I've been out shopping and saw all the back to school sales.)  In addition, despite our very limited numbers, we have managed to lose two more members, Jack D. Unrue and Phillip Gonia in the past week and had several others that have come in and then faded just during this current discussion (Warner for example).
<li> (as for my original "vote" question, the question boils down to, should we follow this plan or another one?)
</ul> 
OK.  Here's my take:
<hr>
<h4>Re-organize JOS</h4>
We should re-organize.  I've never been that fond of the JOS name or the JOS organizational structure so my proposal is:
</p><p>
<STRONG>Action Items</STRONG>
<ol> <li> Cede control of <code>JOS.org</code> and related resources (mailing lists, website, sourceforge project, etc) to Gilbert who will continue the JOS.org effort as a Java Operating System research and collaboration project.  The new jos effort can join JOS.org as a "sister project" but will be run independently similarly to Jext (www.jext.org).  individuals are welcome to participate in either or both projects.
<li> Form a new project focused very clearly on creating a Java-based/focused os.  New name, new focus, new resources, same basic people.  This is a "fresh start" that gives us the freedom to quickly recast the project as we see fit.
</ol> <h4>New jos Organization (NJO)</h4>
I'm a pragmatic Open Source advocate.  I don't see source code access as 
fundamental right like the freedom of speech.  I believe there are 
situations where open source benefits everyone (and also situations 
where this is not true).  I believe in openness in research and academic 
pursuits.  I believe in open collaboration.  I believe people should get 
paid for their work and that you have the right to charge for software.  
I believe that code contributors should share in profits produced using 
their work.  For this new organization I propose:
<h4>License</h4>
Binaries produced by <! page="">NJO</a> are available at no-cost for download and 
minimal fee for CD's.
</p><p>
Core source is covered under a modified <! page="">SCSL</a> (see www.sun.com).  
Modifications are made simply to reassign the license to NJO rather than 
Sun. Research/academic use is free. Internal commercial usage requires 
passing compatibility tests. Commercial products or redistribution 
requires compatibility testing and a commercial license (if you make 
money, NJO gets some of it).
</p><p>
Non-strategic source is released under a <a href="BSD.html">BSD</a> license... essentially 
public domain with a disclaimer.  This would particularly cover useful 
tools and utilities.
</p><p>
I realize this is going to be highly controversial and unpalatable to 
<! page="">GPL</a> fanatics. My primary reasoning is:
<ol> <li> Allows us to negotiate licenses with other organizations.  In particular, I propose using <! page="">SCSL</a> code (the kvm and libraries) to bootstrap our development.  In the future we may be able to create our own version of both the vm and libraries.  But the first "ugly and quick" versions will be much faster to produce if we use the Sun code. Also opens the possibility of using a commercial kernel... <a href="QNX.html">QNX</a> being a strong contender in my mind.
<li> fits with my philosophy as a "pragmatic open source advocate"
<li> provides possibility of hiring developers to work on NJO full time
</ol> <h4>Organization</h4>
NJO needs to form a company to manage the commercial license. I would be willing to do this.  In this case, it would be a CA, <! page="">USA</a> company. Technical decisions are made using an Apache model.  Business decisions are made as they do in coops (consensus voting amongst "members" who are either investors or "sweat equity" owners). A "business manager" <! page="">CEO</a> makes day to day business decisions and voting is monthly on "significant issues" along with full disclosure of operations (financials, etc). Eventually we transition to a Sun/Java Community Process model.
<h4>Product/Focus</h4>
NJO needs an extremely clear and easy to execute product focus to succeed.  To maximize the chance of success, exploit the current "hot topic" in Java development, and create a very interesting design, I 
think NJO os v. 1.0 should be:
<ul> <li> J2ME <! page="">CLDC</a> MIDP compliant
<li> runs on x86 (386+)
<li> <! page="">VGA</a> (640x480) 16 color micro-gui
<li> ne2000 ethernet networking
<li> keyboard and mouse support.
</ul> 
If we have time I'd also like to add <! page="">PPP</a> modem support. Essentially it will work like a <! page="">PalmOS</a> written in Java for a PC.  The system would be built with:
<ul> <li> <STRONG>Microkernel</STRONG> - picoBSD (stripped down <a href="FreeBSD.html">FreeBSD</a> www.freebsd.org) or <a href="QNX.html">QNX</a> (www.qnx.com). Essentially boot up and provides the C libraries to run the kvm... also nice to have a kernel tcpip stack so we can avoid writing the tcpip stack for the kvm. <a href="BSD.html">BSD</a> is nice because the license is extremely flexible, their code is clean, and their stuff is FAST. QNX is a nice commercial <! page="">RTOS</a> that developers can download and use for free. QNX will really accelerate our development but when we decide to distribute it, it is going to cost us (at least one developer seat at ~$5000 and a distribution license... less than $1/unit at high volume). It may be easiest to bootstrap and only internally release for "research purposes" a 1.0 using QNX then a 2.0 public release using a custom microkernel (picobsd or our own custom kernel... I'm really attracted to the 32 kernel described in the book, Build your own 32-bit OS by burgess).
<li> <STRONG>kvm</STRONG> - J2ME <! page="">CLDC</a> KVM.  We use the Sun SCSL'd kvm and libraries and port them to our microkernel.  The port is trivial as the <! page="">KVM</a> is relatively simple and requires very little from the microkernel (threading is done in the kvm not the os).
<li> <STRONG><! page="">CLDC</a></STRONG> <STRONG><! page="">MIDP</a> libraries</STRONG> - We use the Sun SCSL'd libraries.
<li> <STRONG><! page="">NJO</a></STRONG> <STRONG><! page="">GUI</a> libraries</STRONG> - Custom libraries that implement the <! page="">MIDP</a> graphics libraries for our particular platform (vga). For <a href="BSD.html">BSD</a> this is going to have be some native graphics library (Xwindows seems way too much overkill for this). For QNX we use their excellent neutrino GUI.
<li> <STRONG><! page="">NJO</a> drivers</STRONG> - Hard coded drivers for standard ibm vga video, ne2000 ethernet, keyboard, mouse. Whatever the underlying microkernel offers here is what we'll use.
<li> <STRONG><! page="">NJO</a> desktop</STRONG> - a pure Java desktop app to handle <! page="">MIDP</a> midlet installations, manage applications, provide the user operating environment, etc.
</ul> 
<h4>Action items</h4>
Obviously discuss and decide on each of the major issues (organization, 
licensing, product focus). Unless someone has a real strong opinion on 
any particular issue we can tackle them in this order:
</p><p>
<ol> <li> Decide to split off separate NJO (I don't think this proposal is appropriate under JOS)
<li> Decide on NJO organization (license + biz org)
<li> Decide on product focus (overall platform)
<li> Decide on 1.0 implementation details (picoBSD vs <a href="QNX.html">QNX</a> vs etc)
<li> Form organization, start development.
</ol> <hr>
Obviously this is a pretty radical departure from the current JOS status 
quo. I expect people to have some strong reactions and hopefully good 
feedback. Blast away. :)
</p><p>

<hr>
</p><p>
It seems to me you are suggesting a view similar to <a href="GilbertsProjectGoalDiscussion.html">GilbertsProjectGoalDiscussion</a> for JOS, but that you are also proposing an implementation project.
</p><p>
This leads me to think that <! page="">JOS</a> needs to more clearly define sub/sister projects, I don't see a <EM>specific</EM> <! page="">NJO</a> project as counter to a broader picture of JOS.
</p><p>
On the implementation project I suspect that I disagree with a number of
points. I think:
</p><p>
<ol> <li> picoBSD is too big
<li> QNX's license is too restrictive
<li> both are too narrowly ported
<li> Redhat's eCos is a much beter choice (includes Linux user mode HAL)
<li> add serial port support (debugging !)
</ol> 
Now the question is why is this project interesting ?
</p><p>
I think your project was too middle-of-the-road to be interesting.  I agree it needs to be small, to be focussed, to do something sort of novel.
</p><p>
Perhaps it should target a Palm Pilot ?
<ul> <li> Palm makes a reasonable simulator available
<li> the ucLinux people have documented lots
<li> the lack of a <! page="">VMM</a> is <STRONG>irrelevant</STRONG> to Java
<li> the hardware device list is small and fixed
<li> the <! page="">GUI</a> <STRONG>must</STRONG> be simple.
<li> Dragonball is a nice, simple architecture (x86 is not)
</ul>
