<EM>Article contributed by <a href="GilbertHerschberger.html">GilbertHerschberger</a> (23 August 2000).</EM>
<H4>Introduction</H4>
As a frequent contributor, it is no surprise that the JOS Wiki is one of my favorite parts of the JOS Project. This Wiki is an multiple volume encyclopedia for serious systems programming. It provides what may be the most comprehensive set of technical definitions and Internet references around. It answers a lot of difficult questions and raises a lot of difficult issues. It reflects the thinking of its independent members.
</P><P>
The JOS Wiki is a valuable asset. It helps new members of the JOS Project learn about our history, strategy and goals. It helps old members document what works and what doesn't. It is an independent voice. It helps the Java community learn about the strengths and weaknesses of the Java technologies. It helps virtual machine designers understand the challenges of implementing bytecode processes within a virtual machine. It helps programmers mix C/C++ with their Java programs.
</P><P>
Even without regular maintenance, the JOS Wiki is a historical record of a revolutionary time in the software industry. It provides insights for furture generations of programmers. It captures the moment when Java was new and expectations were high.
</P><P>
Regular maintenance helps retain the value of the JOS Wiki in the day-to-day operations of the JOS Project. It requires not one, not two, but three kinds of regular maintenance.
<OL> <LI> The JOS Wiki programs drive the website. These programs should be maintained. This kind of maintenance adds a new features or fixes an existing one.
<LI> The Wiki program uses templates for maximum flexibility. These templates should be maintained. This kind of maintenance is a great responsibility. It has very immediate and very visible impact on the look and feel of our website.
<LI> The actual content contains most of the value of the Wiki. This is the maintenance of the articles themselves.
</OL> <H4>Article maintenance</H4>
There are different kinds of articles. Each kind of article requires a different schedule of regular maintenance.
<UL> <LI> <STRONG>It is neither practical nor desireable to maintain every article every month.</STRONG>
</UL> It is not practical because article maintenance is time-consuming and our volunteer members have a limited amount of time. It is not desireable because each article is unique; it needs its own amount of maintenance.
<UL> <LI> historical
<LI> reference
<LI> how-to
<LI> operational
</UL> Members would like to know what has already been done. Some articles are <EM>historical</EM>, providing an eye-witness account of some historical event. An article might explain what happened to a another project. These articles require the least amount of maintenance. Except for updated cross-reference links, these articles should be left alone.
</P><P>
Members would like to know where more information can be found in publications, such as books, articles and on the Internet. Some articles are <EM>reference</EM>, providing links to other sources of information. These articles require regular maintenance. New sources of information should be added to as soon as it is available. References should be updated when a Internet link is broken. Obsolete and out-dated reference should be carefully documented.
</P><P>
Members would like to know how to do things. Some articles are <EM>how-to</EM>, providing a step-by-step description to accomplish something. They answer questions like: <EM>How do I...become a member?</EM> And, <EM>how do I...download, compile and use application X?</EM> These articles should reflect the most recent understanding of how to do something and are probably the most important for our members. The operation of the JOS Project can change over time. The best way to do something yesterday might not be the best way to do it today. One person cannot maintain all these articles. They should be maintained as needed by a <a href="WebSteward.html">WebSteward</a>.
</P><P>
Members would like to know about other members. Some articles are <EM>operational</EM>, providing links to mailing lists, member lists and other Wiki articles. These articles change frequently. They require the greatest amount of maintenance. They can become out-of-date very quickly. As a member, the maintenance schedule of your personal article is your responsibility.
<H4>Purpose</H4>
Maintenance of the JOS Wiki should not be confused with the purpose of the JOS Project. The purpose of the JOS Project is to work toward the creation of a free Java-based operating system, which involves Java and C/C++ programming skills. It was not the creation of an on-line encyclopedia, which involves technical writing skills. While regular maintenance of this Wiki is important, it should not overshadow the creation of a new operating system.<BR><BR></P><!--
