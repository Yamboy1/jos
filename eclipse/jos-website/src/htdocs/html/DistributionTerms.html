<p><EM>Article contributed by <a href="GilbertHerschberger.html">GilbertHerschberger</a> (28 February 2000).</EM></p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Just so we can all speak the same language, consistent terminology for JOS distribution should be established. Archive names should be consistent across all JOS-related products. A mirror of JOS-related products has been started at <a href="http://cjos.sourceforge.net/redist/mirror">http://cjos.sourceforge.net/redist/mirror</a> .</p>
<p>It is critical for others to understand at-a-glance what we distribute. <! page="">JOSDistribution</a> should be more like distribution for Linux. This is documented in <EM>Linux Programmer's Reference</EM>, a book I picked up at <a href="http://www.bn.com/">Barnes &amp; Noble</a> this weekend. I'm sure you'll find it at your local bookstore.</p>
<p>On Linux, a shared library can be application-specific or not. When it is application-specific, one application depends on it. Such a library is stored in the application's directory.</p>
<p>A common library, on the other hand, is used by more than one application. Such a library is stored, not in an application's directory, but in a system-wide directory. Common libraries are often installed in /lib and /usr/lib.</p>
<p>The requirements for a common library is more strict than for an application-specific library. When a common library is not backward compatible it must be given a new name. Otherwise, applications that depend on the old interface will be unreliable. On the honor system, a common library must remain backward-compatible as long as the library has the same name.</p>
<h4>Proposal</h4>
<p>The following naming convention provides a unique distribution name for each release of a JOS-related product.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Form 1: <EM>major</EM> . <EM>minor</EM> - <EM>release</EM>
<p>This form is typically used for <EM>application</EM> products. An application is a end-user product. A new release of an application might be intended to replace all previous releases. When there are no other systems dependent upon your application, you are not required preserve system-level compatibility.</p>
<p>Jext is an application. Its version is 2.7.0. Version 2.7.0 has been released three times. Under form 1, its archive might be named like this:</p>
<p><EM>jext-2.7.0-3.zip</EM></p>
<li><p>Form 2: <EM>major</EM> <EM>prototype</EM> - <EM>release</EM>
<p>This form is typically used for <EM>system</EM> products. A system product is an API, framework, library or subsystem. A new release of a system product cannot replace previous releases when there are other applications and subsystems dependent upon it. A system product can be removed only when all products that depend on it are upgraded or removed.</p>
<p>Smart API is an API and framework. Its current versions are 1a, 1b and 2b. Version 2b does not replace, but depends on versions 1a and 1b. Version 2b has been released six times. Under form 2, the next archive might be named like this:</p>
<p><EM>smartapi-2b-7.zip</EM></p>
</ul>
<h4>Compatibility</h4>
<p>Version and release are used to help others understand what kind of backward compatibility has been preserved. The version should remain the same for as long as the product is compatible. After fixing a bug in a product, the product should be re-distributed using the same version and a new release.</p>
<p>A product can be distributed in more than one archive file format. It is important for archives that contain the same thing to have similar names.</p>

<p><STRONG>zip2tgz</STRONG></p>
<p>Do you know of a Java-based archive conversion program? If not, would you like to build one?</p>
<p>I need to convert .zip files to .tgz files. I already have a .zip file with everything I want to distribute. In fact, the .zip file is stored on my Linux server. Instead of re-creating the archive from scratch, I  would like to convert the .zip file to an equivalent .tgz file.</p>

<p>A product can be distributed in different editions. It is important for different editions to have similar names.</p>

<h4>Definitions</h4>
<p>This is a revised list of distribution terms. These are the terms I am going to use in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><STRONG>Version</STRONG></p>
<p>A <EM>version</EM> of a product must be closely related to its design (or intended design). A version is a pair of numbers separated by a dot. First, the major version indicates the prerequisites, assumptions and premise for the product. You can let others know that you are changing the rules in a major way by upgrading the major version number. (The minor version is reset to zero.)</p>
<p>Second, the minor version indicates a specific implementation of the design. It might take more than one implementation to meet the design goals of a major version. You can let others know that you are changing the design again by upgrading the minor version number. (The release number is reset to zero.)</p>
<p>A minor version does not change when fixing defects in implementation. For Java, a minor version must change when public or protected methods are changed. Under some circumstances, a minor version does not need to change when introducing new classes and/or new packages.</p>
<p>Previously, I have been using <EM>release</EM> to indicate a pair of version and prototype. In Release <EM>1a</EM>, '1' is the major version and 'a' is the minor version or prototype.</p>
<p>Extreme reuse requires that version 1b does not replace version 1a. Version 1b does not need to provide any interface or class found in version 1a. This is unlike products labeled with n.n, where version 1.1 replaces version 1.0.</p>
<li><p><STRONG>Release</STRONG></p>
<p>When a product is packaged for distribution, a snapshot is created. A snapshot is uploaded to a website or copied to a diskette or CD-ROM. One version of a product might have one or more snapshots distributed. Each snapshot is a <EM>release</EM> and has its own unique release number. Release numbers start with one (1).</p>
<p>Previously, I have been using <EM>distribution</EM> to uniquely identify each snapshot. Each snapshot is meant for distribution.</p>
<li><p><STRONG>Build</STRONG></p>
<p>This is different and separate from a build. It might take more than one attempt to build a snapshot worthy of distribution. Builds are used internally to keep track of which build succeeded and which failed during testing.</p>
<p>I have been using a timestamp to indicate each build and will continue to do so.</p>
</ul>
<h4>Transition</h4>
<p>It might take a while to transition from <code>release (version-prototype)</code> to version <code>(major.minor) release</code>.</p>
