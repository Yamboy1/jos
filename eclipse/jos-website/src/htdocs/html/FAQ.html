1. <STRONG>JOS: <! page="">THE</a> PROJECT</STRONG> 
</P><P>
<STRONG>What is JOS?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> A free Java-based operating system.
</UL> 
<STRONG>What do you mean free? You're not actually giving it away are you?  Why do I want it if it's not worth paying for? and Don't you want to sell it and make money?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> Free software is a topic in and of itself. It's a complex topic, and I 've been looking into it for awhile now.  For JOS, we intend to make use of revolutionary ideas about this (and everything else too :).  The licensing issues are still very much in flux.  Whatever we come up with will qualify as <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>. This means that anyone may freely redistribute the software with it's source code and a copy of the license.  As for us...all (ok, most) of us have "day jobs" and are involved in this project because it deeply interests us.  It is this personal motivation which makes free software projects work.<!-- [Personally,  I'd like to see it be entirely GPL. We'll probably be snagging device driver code from Linux, and mixed licensing would become a hassle.  -- <a href="KeithMason.html">KeithMason</a> 16-Mar-1998] It's being considered, believe me. -- who? when? Lots of things are being considered, and belief is nearly irrelevant :) In any case, I don't want to put anything less vague in here, although I will add to the submitting code section a <! page="">DFSG</a> guideline. See down there -adric 3mar99 -->
</UL> 
<STRONG>How did JOS get started?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> Well, it all started with a posting by Stefan Borg to the <a href="JavaLobby.html">JavaLobby</a>'s (www.javalobby.org) <a href="JavaOS.html">JavaOS</a> Forum on October 3, 1997. Our thanks to Rick Ross and the Java Lobby, both for that organization's efforts on behalf of the Java community and for the support our project has received.
</UL> 
<UL> <LI> <b><font color=red>New passage here to describe 'relaunch'</font></b>
</UL> 
<STRONG>How do you pronounce JOS?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> The JOS development team has officially agreed to disagree on this topic.  JOS is pronounced however you feel it should be pronounced.
</UL> 
<STRONG>Why is a Yin-Yang symbol in the logo?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> Look at <a href="JosLogo.html">JosLogo</a> - an explanatory text written by <a href="MasonZhwiti.html">MasonZhwiti</a>, the creator of the logo.
</UL> 
<HR>
<A name="2">
2. <STRONG>JOS: <! page="">THE</a> DEVELOPER <! page="">COMMUNITY</a></STRONG>
</P><P>
<STRONG>How can I join the project?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> Read this whole FAQ, at least once.  Then, enter the collaboration area and read the <! page="">main</a> and <a href="GoodStyle.html">GoodStyle</a> pages.  Add your name to the appropriate section of <a href="MemberList.html">MemberList</a> (instructions on that page).  Join the announce mailing list, and any others that interest you.  Then, join the fray in the discussions on the web or mail!  Please ask anyone for help if you need it.  Much of this will be automated as <! page="">JIP</a> comes along in development. 
</UL> <!-- adric, 3mar99, minor edits -->
</P><P>
<STRONG>What are the major tasks that JOS members are working on?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<!-- Stewards and their sections here? -->
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> <a href="MarkusPeter.html">MarkusPeter</a> and <a href="ClarkEvans.html">ClarkEvans</a> are administering the non- <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a> portions of the site.
</UL> 
<UL> <LI> The web site has started a collection of collaborative documents aimed at specifying what exactly we are trying to build. 
</UL> 
<!-- ^^^ redundant? vvv -->
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> Active discussions revolving around different aspects of JOS are going on in the mailing lists and on the <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a>. In addition, people have started working independently on a number of JOS projects including, but not limited to, a picokernel and a VM based on Kaffe that supports JOS requirements. 
</UL> 
<!-- Start a list.. <! page="">JIP</a> jjos/decaf <a href="JADE.html">JADE</a> .. ? -->
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> <b><font color=red>This section is scheduled for an update when 2q1999 ships</font></b>
</UL> 
<STRONG>Any more specific projects known?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> Take a look at the <a href="SignUpList.html">SignUpList</a> and the <a href="WorkingGroups.html">WorkingGroups</a> at <a href="http://www.jos.org/cgi/hypertext.cgi">http://www.jos.org/cgi/hypertext.cgi</a> for more details on specific projects.

</UL> 
<!-- I'd like to put some of the good news about jjos/decaf here :) -->
</P><P>
<!-- New section on collaboration with other groups, like classpath, JAF? and so forth here -->
</P><P>
<STRONG>What is <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a> and how do I use it or install a copy?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<!-- JOSWiki itself will be replaced by <! page="">JIP</a> <EM>eventually</EM>, right? -->
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> The <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a> is a clone of <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>'s <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>. A special page has been setup on <a href="HowToInstallJosWiki.html">HowToInstallJosWiki</a>
</UL> 
<UL> <LI> It allows anyone to create/update pages on the jos.org web site. It should be used to create and maintain membership lists, brainstorm sessions, requirement documents, detailed specifications, sample code, and other documents essential to the health of the JOS Project, like this one.
</UL>  
<STRONG>How do I see previous versions of Wiki Pages?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> Put a ?rev=# at the end of the URL.  For example:	 <a href="http://www.jos.org/wiki/view/main/FAQ?rev=1.1">http://www.jos.org/wiki/view/main/FAQ?rev=1.1</a>
</UL> 
<STRONG>How do I contribute code?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> <b><font color=red>This section is due for a major overhaul as <! page="">JIP</a> develops</font></b> 
</UL> 
<UL> <LI> Put your package into the <! page="">NameSpace</a> under org.jos.experimental.<i>handle</i>.<i>project name</i> and create a Wiki Page for discussion of it. <!-- This is what we want for all but system essential hacking, right? <a href="CVS.html">CVS</a> write is for kernelish stuff only right now, afaik -->
</UL> 
<UL> <LI> Make sure that your code has a license notice in the header and/or documentation block.  Any <! page="">DFSG</a> license is happy for now. See the Debian Free Software Guidelines or ask on the lists for more info. <!-- adric 3mar99, You can ask me, if you're bright enough to be reading the source, but I don't want to hardcode my name in here... which reminds me of something. Should I add a line saying we must reject code with no copyright/license bit? We kind of have to do that, but it sounds bad... -->
</UL> 
<UL> <LI> Announce to the appropriate list.
</UL> 
<UL> <LI> If there is an contact person for a similar project on the Wiki, get in touch with them to work out a strategy.  If there is no contact person, make yourself one!
</UL> 
	<!-- * Contact  know so that a copy can be archived on the ftp server here.  As you update it, send a current Administrator your updates so that the archive copy can be updated. -->
<!-- I can't make sense of that one, so it goes for now &lt;g&gt; -->
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> If you have ftp server access, put your <!-- "working" --> source code on your ftp server for distribution and review.  If you do not have ftp server access, let a current Administrator know and access will be provided for contributions.
</UL> 
<!-- title nomenclature needs to be synced by relaunch. Translation: <! page="">WTF</a> is an Adminstrator? -->
</P><P>
<!-- This is also going for now, as it makes little sense right now.  * When you have an official "release", announce it, and send a current Administrator  a copy so that it can be included in the next official release. -->

3. <STRONG>JOS: <! page="">THE</a> OPERATING <! page="">SYSTEM</a></STRONG>
</P><P>
<STRONG>Aren't there enough operating systems already?  Do we need another one?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> Well, no, and yes.  Computers are still hard to use for some people, and many existing operating systems require expensive hardware to run at useful capacity (to do what most people want to do with them).  Also, there are new technologies emerging constantly in computing, and many have never been implemented in an available operating system.  We want to see what they can do, and whether they can be used to make people's computing experiences better (happier, easier, less expensive, more reliable).
</UL> 
<STRONG>What relationship does JOS have to Linux?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> None officially.  Linux serves as the inspirational basis for much of the project, and JOS is being developed in the hope that a rich, vibrant developer community will spring up to support the project, much as one has for Linux.  Linux proves that a free OS can compete sucessfully with commercial products. There are a number of aspects of Linux which have been identified as weaknesses, however.  Linux suffers from the same ease-of-use issues that <! page="">UNIX</a> does -- unless you really understand <! page="">UNIX</a> Linux can be difficult to install and maintain.  It is a goal of JOS that no special knowledge is required to install and use JOS, and that the interface to the OS be as sophisticated and simple to use as the best examples on the market today.
</UL> 
<STRONG>Isn't Sun already developing a <a href="JavaOS.html">JavaOS</a>?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> Yes, Sun has plans to release an operating system based on their Java technology, called <a href="JavaOS.html">JavaOS</a>.
</UL> 
<STRONG>What relationship does JOS have with Sun's product?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> There is no relationship between Sun's product and JOS, beyond the obvious: both are operating systems built around the Java platform.
</UL> 
<STRONG>Is JOS competing with Sun's <a href="JavaOS.html">JavaOS</a>?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> It is the belief of the developers of JOS that there will be ample room in the market for a free Java OS, even in the face of commercial systems. The reasons are cost and extensibility.  
</UL> 
<UL> <LI> First, being a free OS allows institutions which have to maintain low operating expenses -- such as small businesses, schools, and non-profits -- access to a robust, fully-featured technology.  Although third parties may choose to package JOS and other available Java software into software distributions ala Redhat Linux or Caldera, the OS will also be freely available for download. 
</UL> 
<UL> <LI> Second, a free Java operating system allows any developers full access to the source code of the OS.  Combined with Java's ease-of-programming, this access should make JOS uniquely suited for customized OS solutions that shrink-wrapped OS's cannot deliver.
</UL> 
<STRONG>Why do companies benefit from JOS?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> It will be easy to administer, both locally and remotely.
<LI> It will use their current equipment efficiently.
<LI> They have full access to the source
<LI> That's why companies have leaders, to figure out things like that :)
<LI> The same they do from <a href="GNU.html">GNU</a> and Linux (eg Caldera, <a href="RedHat.html">RedHat</a>, LGS, LH, et al)
<LI> Hmm... Good Question.  (<a href="ClarkEvans.html">ClarkEvans</a> 16-JAN-97)

4. <STRONG>JOS: <! page="">THE</a> APPLICATIONS</STRONG>
</P><P>
<STRONG>What applications will be included with JOS?</STRONG>
<UL> <LI> In addition to providing a free Java operating System, JOS will make available object frameworks and classes for building powerful applications.  <!-- Some of these will ship with, or something like that -->
</UL> 
<STRONG>What unusual applications are people working on?</STRONG>
<UL> <LI> Some members are working on JAS, the Java Application Suite
<LI> <a href="BradNeuberg.html">BradNeuberg</a> is working on XMLPrototypes to mimic traditional file systems
<LI> The user interface design is going to allow for any kind of UI you can imagine.  Currently we are planning a command line interface, a traditional <! page="">GUI</a> interface (familiar) and at least one bleeding edge experimental interface.  See the <a href="UserInterfaceGroup.html">UserInterfaceGroup</a> for more on this.
</UL> 
<STRONG>Will there be an Internet browser?</STRONG>
<!-- Needs updating. I'd like to get the personal pronouns out, or at least the singular ones. -->
<UL> <LI> Definitely.  I am sure that a free browser is out there.  If not, then I give it a few months before one appears.  Since Java is already in the operating system, <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> and <a href="HTML.html">HTML</a> interpreters will be the missing pieces. And JOS will at least be able to run <a href="HotJava.html">HotJava</a> (frozen?) and Netscape's Java based Navigator (cancelled).
<LI> And check out <a href="JosBrowser.html">JosBrowser</a> !!!

5. <STRONG>JOS: <! page="">THE</a> PRODUCT</STRONG>
</P><P>
<STRONG>Where can I download JOS from?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> We appreciate your interest, but we don't have anything ready for public scrutiny quite yet. Give us a little while. Join the announce mailing list, our way of letting you know about things like that. If you still want it to happen more quickly, join us and help!
</UL> 
<STRONG>What is the most common JOS hardware platform?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> Initially, we are targeting an Intel&trade; compatible 486. Our goal is to make the first version fit on a single 3.5" floppy. Failing that, we plan to boot from the floppy &amp; download whatever else we need.
</UL> 
	<STRONG>Will JOS be available for install via FTP?</STRONG>
</P><P>
<UL> <LI> Once we get a shipping product, yes. Keep in mind that the initial distribution is intended to fit on a 1.44 mB floppy disk. When we get to the point where you need hd space, you'll likely be able to boot off the floppy and install from the network (assuming network access).
