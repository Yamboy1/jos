<h3>An API Structure Proposal</h3>
</p><p>
During the last weeks, different ideas came up about what should be the "official <! page="">JOS</a> API". By "JOS API" I mean the classes and interfaces that are exposed to applications running under JOS. These are two approaches I heard of:
</p><p>
<ul>
<li>"The <! page="">JOS</a> API is identical to the <! page="">JDK</a> API - the java.* packages"<p>
Of course, <! page="">JOS</a> must support the whole set of Java core classes. But this isn't enough: Many system-near and some not-so-system-near applications require additional functions that java.* doesn't provide.<p>
</p><p>
<li>"The <! page="">JOS</a> API is the <! page="">JDK</a> API plus the whole contents of org.jos.* (including subpackages)"<p>
This is clearly better than the approach above. There is now no limitation for the functionality <! page="">JOS</a> can provide. But this approach has other severe problems: <ul>
<li>Changing the inner workings of <! page="">JOS</a> at any time after its first release is very difficult; the structure of all public classes, interfaces and methods has to remain compatible. "Compatible" means that classes and methods can't be removed and interfaces can't be changed in any way. Building extensions in such an environment is very difficult.
<li>A "compatibility layer" that allows <! page="">JOS</a> applications to run under other OSes would have to include all <! page="">JOS</a> classes - even if most of them won't be needed.
<li>Perhaps the most important point: Security is void. If applications can access all system classes, they can easily lock up the system, even with a security manager installed. There are many ways to do this; one of the easiest ones is to synchronize on an important system object - this prevents it from working and possibly crashes the whole system.
</ul>
</ul>
</p><p>
<a NAME="requirements">
<h3>Requirements</h3>
</p><p>
Because either approach falls short, I want to propose a different API system. This system matches the following requirements:
<ul>
<li>API implementations are pluggable on a per-class basis (this is important for the "compatibility layer" and generally improves flexibility)
<li>JOS 1 applications run unchanged in <! page="">JOS</a> 2
<li>JOS 1 can be made "look like <! page="">JOS</a> 2" (so <! page="">JOS</a> 2 applications run syntactically in <! page="">JOS</a> 1)
<li>JOS 1 API implementations run unchanged in <! page="">JOS</a> 2
<li>JOS 2 API implementations run unchanged in <! page="">JOS</a> 1
</ul>
</p><p>
(JOS 1 and <! page="">JOS</a> 2 are imaginary <! page="">JOS</a> distributions; the point is that <! page="">JOS</a> 1 is released before <! page="">JOS</a> 2.)
</p><p>
<h3>Description</h3>
</p><p>
My idea is to let applications access java.* and org.jos.api.*. (How access to other classes is prohibited is a question for the <a href="SecurityGroup.html">SecurityGroup</a>.)
</p><p>
The contents of org.jos.api is governed by some rules that will be described now.
</p><p>
<a NAME="designrules">
<h3>Design rules for org.jos.api</h3>
</p><p>
<ul>
<li>org.jos.api may have subpackages. The design rules apply for every subpackage as well as for org.jos.api itself.
<li>org.jos.api contains public abstract classes only. (However, each of these classes may have non-public inner interfaces and classes that don't need to conform to the design rules.)
<li>Every public class' name begins with "Jos", followed by an uppercase character. (This is to avoid name clashes with classes from other packages.)
<li>Every public class extends org.jos.API or an org.jos.api class.
<li>Every public class (let's call it Jos<i>SomeFunctions</i>) contains these elements:
<pre>
	 private static Jos&lt;i&gt;SomeFunctions&lt;/i&gt; implementation = null;
	
	 public static Jos&lt;i&gt;SomeFunctions&lt;/i&gt; getImplementation() {
		  if (implementation == null) 
				String name = "org.jos.api.Jos&lt;i&gt;SomeFunctions&lt;/i&gt;";
				implementation = (Jos&lt;i&gt;SomeFunctions&lt;/i&gt;)
				org.jos.Registry.getAPIImplementation(name, API_VERSION);
		  return implementation;
	 }

	 public static final org.jos.util.Version API_VERSION =
		  new org.jos.util.Version(1, 0);
		  // or any other version number

</pre>
<li>There are no public static methods except getImplementation().
<li>There are no public final methods.
<li>There are no public fields except <code>API_VERSION</code>.
</ul>
</p><p>
<a NAME="quote1">
You may have wondered why we use abstract classes rather than interfaces. The reason is extensibility. (We can't think about extensibility early enough! This has to be done before <! page="">JOS</a> is first released.)
</p><p>
<a NAME="quote2">
Imagine we would want to extend a certain <! page="">JOS</a> 1 interface in <! page="">JOS</a> 2. If we added methods to the interface, <! page="">JOS</a> 1 implementations of that interface wouldn't work in <! page="">JOS</a> 2 (since they don't implement the new methods).
</p><p>
So I think abstract classes are a much better choice. The only disadvantage I can see is that a given class can only inherit from one abstract class, while it can implement multiple interfaces. But in the presence of (anonymous) inner classes, this drawback is already less important.
</p><p>
For the first release of JOS, this additional rule applies:
<ul>
<li>All public non-static methods are abstract.
</ul>
</p><p>
For all subsequent releases, these additional rules apply:
<ul>
<li>No existing methods are changed or removed.
<li>New methods are <STRONG>not</STRONG> abstract (and not final). They provide a default implementation that does one of these things: <ul>
<li>emulate the method's functionality by calling methods of the same or other classes. However, no packages except java.* and org.jos.api.* may be imported.
<li>return null or an error code (if the method semantics allows this)
<li>throw an exception (if the method semantics allows this)
<li>do nothing (if the method serves a notification purpose only)
</ul>
</ul>
</p><p>
<h3>How to use the API</h3>
</p><p>
An application that wants to use the API executes the following code:
<pre>
	 Jos&lt;i&gt;SomeFunctions&lt;/i&gt; someFunc = Jos&lt;i&gt;SomeFunctions&lt;/i&gt;.getImplementation();
	 if ( implementation == null ||
		  !implementation.getVersion.isLaterThanOrEqualTo(1, 4) )
				// the version I need
				// perform an alternative operation, 
				// do nothing or throw an exception
	 else
			someFunc.doSomethingForMe(someFunc.giveMeAValue());
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, very easy! :-)
</p><p>
There's one more thing... What if a <! page="">JOS</a> 2 application runs under <! page="">JOS</a> 1? Assume a new method has been included in Jos<i>SomeFunctions</i> for <! page="">JOS</a> 2. Then the application could also check the API version:
<pre>
	 if (!Jos&lt;i&gt;SomeFunctions&lt;/i&gt;.getAPIVersion().isLaterThanOrEqualTo(2, 0))
		  // error, error

	 Jos&lt;i&gt;SomeFunctions&lt;/i&gt; someFunc = Jos&lt;i&gt;SomeFunctions&lt;/i&gt;.getImplementation();
	 if (implementation == null ||
			!implementation.getVersion.isLaterThanOrEqualTo(1, 4))
			// the version I need
			// perform an alternative operation,
			// do nothing or throw an exception
	 else
			someFunc.doSomethingForMe(someFunc.giveMeAValue());
</pre>
</p><p>
The problem here is subtle. The class verifier checks every reference to a method for its validity. So it would check someFunc.giveMeAValue(); given that giveMeAValue() is a <! page="">JOS</a> 2 method, the check fails in a <! page="">JOS</a> 1 environment. When is that check performed? The Sun VM does it when the surrounding method is executed for the first time. So in the example above, the check would fail.
</p><p>
There is an easy workaround: place the API version check in a separate method that is called before the method that access the actual API functions. But this workaround depends on the class verifier's specific behavior (I don't think Sun has specified <i>when</i> methods should be verified).
</p><p>
A better solution is this: Upgrade <! page="">JOS</a> 1 by loading the <! page="">JOS</a> 2 APIs. Since the API classes are not allowed to import foreign packages and are backwards-compatible, the replacement can be done.
</p><p>
You could bundle the <! page="">JOS</a> 2 APIs with the application and let the installation script load them into the system.
</p><p>
<a NAME="howtowrite">
<h3>How to write an API implementation</h3>
</p><p>
Writing an API implementation is almost as simple as using the API.
</p><p>
First, of course you have to extend the abstract class and implement all the necessary methods:
<pre>
package wherever;

import org.jos.api.*;

class Jos&lt;i&gt;SomeFunctions&lt;/i&gt;Impl extends Jos&lt;i&gt;SomeFunctions&lt;/i&gt; {
	 public static org.jos.util.Version getImplementedVersion() {
		  return new org.jos.util.Version(1, 0);
	 }
	 
	 [...]
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The class doesn't even need to be public. It is attached to the API through a <STRONG>factory</STRONG>. A factory is an object that knows where the implementation for some or all org.jos.api classes is to be found. This is one way to register the API implementation:
<pre>
import org.jos.Registry;

Registry.SimpleAPIImplementationFactory factory =
	 new Registry.SimpleAPIImplementationFactory();
String name = "org.jos.api.Jos&lt;i&gt;SomeFunctions&lt;/i&gt;";
factory.addEntry(name, "wherever.Jos&lt;i&gt;SomeFunctions&lt;/i&gt;Impl");
Registry.registerAPIImplementationFactory(factory);
</pre>
</p><p>
This code has to be executed some time before the corresponding API is used for the first time.
</p><p>
The factory stores strings and not actual references to the classes to delay their loading as long as possible (for some classes may not be needed at all).
</p><p>
<h3>To come</h3>
</p><p>
I intend to bundle a jos-api.jar archive that is updated regularly and holds the API framework as well as any org.jos.api classes that are developed by any of you or by myself.
</p><p>
I in no way want to "control" the <! page="">JOS</a> APIs. I just volunteer to bundle the API releases. Having such releases will be increasingly important as more <! page="">JOS</a> applications are developed.
</p><p>
<h3>Any questions?</h3>
</p><p>
I hope you don't have too many questions (because I hope to have expressed my concept clearly). But I do hope that you have many comments - agreement or disagreement.
</p><p>

Nice design Stefan.  This is quite similar to the Facade pattern and the <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> pattern.  I will read those again and see if there is anything more we can take from there.  In the meanwhile why the Josxxx? That is similar to MS's CObject both are a bad idea!
<hr>
Yes, please see if there is anything we can add from the book (where can I get it?). The "JosXXX" naming convention is introduced so that you can immediately tell if and where <! page="">JOS</a> classes are used. It also helps reduce name clashes. Any other thoughts on this?
</p><p>
--StefanReich, 7-Apr-98
<hr>
Stefan,
  The concept of Packages have been created to handle name clashing issues in a real nice way.  I dont think we need to qualify all our classes by the josXXX thing since they will be unique inside org.jos.api.XXX

Stefan,
<p>It has been difficult to explain the difference between the Java API, your API proposal and a <! page="">SmartAPI</a>. Starting with some of the issues presented here in your proposal, I am planning to build a map. We have good reasons to stop following Sun Microsystem's example of the Java API and standard extensions. What are those reasons? All members of the <! page="">JOS</a> project need to discuss this.</p>
<p>The issues of API are fundamental to the strengths and weaknesses of the finished operating system. This discussion is at the heart of JOS. -- <a href="GilbertHerschberger.html">GilbertHerschberger</a> (20 July 1999).<br><br></p><!--
