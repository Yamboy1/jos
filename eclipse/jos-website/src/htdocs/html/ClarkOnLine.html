Yep.  I'm in the same boat... should head home.
</p><p>
<hr>
More details...
</p><p>
Basically, the memory manager would then service the request and 
put/get the memory from the stack.  That's that.
</p><p>
There are a few items that need to be addressed:
<ol> <li>  Not all classes can be supported by all managers
<li>  Inter-manager object references.  
</ol> 
Hmmmm.....
</p><p>
<hr>
</p><p>
<i> Database=no file system? </i>  Well, from a users perspective, NO.  They have no clue how the information is stored (unlike, say Word).
</p><p>
<hr>
To detail how this <EM>might</EM> work for references:
</p><p>
Ok.  First of all, the VM reference says that object
references are 32 bits.  Fun.  I do not think that there is
a reason why we can't implement this differently as long as
we meet this illusion to the corrsponding bytecodes.
</p><p>
For the time being, let us limit our conversation to get/set
for fields of an object since this is 80% of the meat.
</p><p>
Lets say that our "Reference" data type is partitioned
into two parts.  The high word gives an address or offset
in a jump table for the interface of the memory manager 
being used to minipulate the object.  The low word is
can be used by the memory manager any way we see fit.
</p><p>
Although this is not the best solution, it is the most obvious.
This gives us 16 bits to define the memory managers (too much)
and 16 bits that the memory manager can use to identify an
object (too few).  We could play lots of games to make this
ratio a bit better, for instance we could use the first bit
to denote if we are using the "normal, volitale RAM" manager.  This would give us 31 bits of address space for that one manager, 15 bits for other managers, and 16 bits for the address space in that manager.  Alternatively, a double dispach can be used... but these are just (important) details....
<hr>
<b> Did you get what I was saying about the bytecodes?</b>
</p><p>
They are the interface to move information from the data
store (RAM,Disk,OODBMS,RDBMS,DistributedObject,etc) to 
the stack.
</p><p>
Make sence?  They are interface unified model. Processing:
</p><p>
<ol> <li>   Input (Get <! page="">ByteCodes</a>, Implemented by memory manager)
<li>   Processing (Implemented by the other bytecodes)
<li>   Output (Set Bytecodes, Implemented by memory manager)
</ol> 
The Oracle memory manager, for instance, would be serving
up objects.. the objects would <EM>never</EM> actually exist
in <! page="">RAM</a> on the computer... the Get/Set would be translated
into the correct <! page="">SQL</a> and executed.  There are lots of
issues here... but it would be great if the OS supported
the pluggable opportunity.
</p><p>
<hr>
<! page="">GrandUnifiedMemoryModel</a>?	Do you have a better
name for the <! page="">MultipleMemoryManagers</a> concept then?  
</p><p>
Actually, most of the applcations I work with are database
applications.  So, yes, there is no file system.  Just one
big gigantic object space.  And it is a shit load of code
to make the illusion magical.  I just keep having to reinvent
this wheel again and again and again and again and frankly
I'm getting sick of operating systems that don't <! page="">DoTheRightThing</a>(tm).
Basically the user interface talks to the user in "their" 
terms.  When a word processing document is finished it says
"publish?" not "save?".  Save is stupid. Of course it is saved.
</p><p>
Oracle's object-relational support is mediocre.  The binding
is what is really poor and needs help.  Yep, actually in this
years <! page="">EuroPloP</a> a rather nice 15 page paper was published on
the topic.  Code listings don't really help much since it
lacked so much necessary detail.  <! page="">JavaBlend</a> is basically 
the same approach.... although majorly flawed.  It sits on
top of JDBC.  I need to spend more time to really evaluate it,
but so far I am not really that impressed.  I can imagine
it being painfullly slow and not handling all of the distribued
concerns that you need to be worried about (JDBC simply
hides most of them).  Anyway, a Oracle memory manager woudl
talk directly to the sockets of the Oracle <a href="DBMS.html">DBMS</a> and leverage
distribued transactions, etc the whole shebang!
</p><p>
</p><p>
<hr>
I don't know, perhaps I am just being plain old weird here.
But why not?  Sure performance. Well, lets finish brain storming
it out, make a quick prototype and claim inneficient later?  Or
is this too much to ask.
</p><p>
<ol> <li>  One interface for object storage
<li>  One interface for array allocations.
<li>  One for local variables?
<li>  One for stacks? (really far fetched here.)
<li>  etc.
</ol> 
A memory manager can implement the interfaces it chooses.
A class can specify which memory manager is used for
its class instances in the <a href="ClassRepository.html">ClassRepository</a>.  We can
make an intelligent guess (the default) for most entries.
</p><p>
In addition, different <! page="">ProcessEnvironments</a> might want
to use different managers for their objects if the
classes requested have not specified which one they
require.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<hr>
About <! page="">GrandUnifiedMemoryModel</a>,
</p><p>
Well... the Java byte codes __are__ the model.
</p><p>
Sure you can say that it is an ideal, and some of 
the later things are a bit on the, well, shall we say,
heated list?  I have read Sun's papers on making distribued
access the same as local acess.. they have valid points, but
I think they are being overly pessimistic.  
</p><p>
Anyway, persistent storage <EM>is</EM> about ignoring the 
difference between ram and disk and leaving it up
to the operating system to handle the details.
</p><p>
It would be nice if we could make our memory management
model open so that people could play around and perhaps
find a practical way to do this effectively...
It just <EM>might</EM> happen.  (I might make 
access to objects in an relational Oracle database happen)
Any other way to do this is <EM>just</EM> as flawed.  And database
programmers <EM>do not</EM> handle the errors, I say let's push
it down to the memory manager level where I believe
it really belongs.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<hr>
</p><p>
About the bytecodes....
</p><p>
<ul> <li> Field variables: Sure they take a value in the stack and modify the memory.  This is the responsibility of the memory manager to go out and make the update / read actually happen.
</ul> 
<ul> <li> Local storage: Same thing, only dealing with "process" level storage bytes.  It is taking items to/from a memory space and putting them on the stack for minipulation.
</ul> 
<ul> <li> Creating objects&amp; arrays. Glad we agree here.
</ul> 
<ul> <li> Array Elements:  Same thing.  Does this make sence?  
</ul> 
<hr>
<i>  When I think memory manager, I'm thinking of the part of the OS that's responsible for allocating RAM, tracking available RAM, and managing paging to disk. </i>  Yep.
</p><p>
There is nothing saying that a user level memory manager 
might not use default kernel level memroy managers for
some of the really nasty implementation stuff.  
</p><p>
<! page="">WhatThisAllows</a>:
</p><p>
<ol> <li>  Different memory managers implement different policies.
<li>  Some memory managers manage "persistent memory".
<li>  There might be some "don't cash" memory mangers.
<li>  Depending upon object granulairy a few classes (sound files) might want to implement their own memory manger that would cashe the object appropriately for performance.
<li>  (I always get slammed here, but remote objects)
<li>  A memory manger to handle objects in a relational datbase
<li>  A memory manager to handle object oriented databases
<li>  A memory manager for my <! page="">EEPROM</a> or Hardware card.
<li>  Security to be moved to a lower level (if needed)
</ol> 
</p><p>
<hr>
About half of the bytecodes are used for the following:
</p><p>
<ul> <li> Getting/Setting member field variables
<li> Getting/Setting static field variables
<li> Getting/Setting local storage
<li> Creating objects 
<li> Creating arrays
<li> Getting/Setting elements in arrays
<li> etc. 
</ul> 
Anyway, there is no reason why we could not make an interface
out of this and allow multiple memory managers on a 
process/class level?  Mabye even object level.
</p><p>
<hr>
</p><p>
Hmm. Well.	<! page="">MemoryManger</a>...  the problem with many operating
systems is that you are forced into the memory management 
policies set by the one and only memory manager.  In short
I would like this monster replaceable... on a class by class 
level.  In this way my Order objects can be managed by
a <! page="">OracleMemoryManager</a>... etc.  Bathroom break. <grin>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<hr>
</p><p>
Well, sure desktop vs process.  I need to think more on this
one.  However, what is a "service" in Windows?  It is a
program that is always running in the background - infact
some services do their best to carry on as they left off.
</p><p>
There is another big problem with saving processes, that
is transient variables.... this might make things unworkable.
</p><p>
But actually, saving process is only about 5% or less of what
I am really after....
</p><p>
<hr>
</p><p>
1.  I agree here.  We <EM>could</EM> use serilization to save classes.
I see this as a policy of a memory manager.  :) Agree here
</p><p>
2.  Nope, nothing dictates, infact even though they say that
references are 32 bits, nothing saying we can use something else as long as the VM works as expected.  :) Agree here
</p><p>
3.  <a href="ObjectStore.html">ObjectStore</a> TM  They have a pre compiler that creates Load/Save
methods on existing class files.  Basically they modify the class
files and do swizzling without help of the VM.  It is a <EM>really</EM> nasty way to do it and it is not very transparent.. they use proxy objects everwhere.  (The pre compiler generates a class with the identical interface that does a residency check and then delegates)
</p><p>
4. I am no expert here either.  Just interested.  I have alot of Oracle background and a math degree so it is not so rough.  Simple stuff they have going.
</p><p>
5.  Hmm.  Don't get this point.  Let me try to explain the Memory Manager.
<hr>
</p><p>
Yes.  Processes __can__ be persisted.	This saves the users
desktop right were they left off, etc.  It brings up a host of problems, like locks.  I guess your point is somewhat valid, what <EM>good</EM> is it.  Hmm.  Well it would leave the user right where they
left off... plain and simple.  With their "unsaved" (or I would re-name it "unpublished" ) document up in their editor...
</p><p>
<hr>
</p><p>
Great!
Hmm History, well Markus is the one who wrote the 
1. 
</p><p>
<a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a> and set up the mailing lists.  I can get you
the source if you want.  Can Markus
This mechinism for chatting really sucks.  Goddamit!
I should just write a <a href="HTTP.html">HTTP</a> tunneling vesion of <! page="">IQC</a>
so I can get through the firewall here.
</p><p>
2.  Hmm bit aggressive.  It is not always good to put everything in the glossary.. but you recognize this.	I would love a
<! page="">NameJustRight</a> TM but am very afraid that it is impractical.
</p><p>
3.  :)  This is nice, sounds a bit like <a href="JavaLobby.html">JavaLobby</a>....
My vision for this is different than Java Lobby.  I <EM>want</EM>
people to edit other peoples stuff.  This is what
is different.  This signing shit is for the birds. I wish
for instance, that you would have edited in your
comments/uncertienties and merged them with what I wrote.
It ends up being much more cohesive document that way.
Hmm... well I don't know.

</p><p>
Well, I think that process can be persisted.  If you read the grasshopper stuff they are doing it, PJama will do this in the future as well....  There is nothing saying that during the "stabiliation" process the stack is saved, etc....  We can pull really nice tricks to pull this off beacuse we are writing our own VM.
</p><p>
<hr>
  1. A persistence mechanism exists in Java: Serializable, etc.
</p><p>
Yes it does, but it is an all or nothing kind of thing.  You have to stream the object and all of its references in one big file.  This does not scale to a corporate order entry system.
</p><p>
  2. This mechanism relies on streams.
</p><p>
Yep. It is also slow beacuse the "saved" format is different from teh internal format.  Read about Grasshopper and PJama.... they are doing what is called <! page="">OthogonalPersistence</a>
</p><p>
  3. If we define some "default" serialization for Object in the
VM or kernel that makes sense for JOS, we could persist anything we wanted to.
</p><p>
Yep.  This is the way to go.....
</p><p>
<ol> <li> 5 Alternatively, we might have created a portable object store if we can implement it in 100% Pure
</ol> 
Hmm.  Nope <! page="">ODI</a> has done the best they can... and it sucks. Working within the confines of 100% Pure is good, but it is just not going to scale.  Sun recognizes this, which is why they are funding a bunch of persistence research... eventually this will make its way into Java.
</p><p>
  4. A streaming file system can be efficient. Look up the stuff
on Sprite that I added to the OS readings. It claims improved performance over Unix I/O.
</p><p>
Hmm. Could you educate me here?
</p><p>
  5. I just generally like the idea that we build on Java to
handle what we want, instead of hacking extra stuff in if we can help it.
</p><p>
I understand the concern.  I want the kernel extensible.  And yes, the kernel extensions will not be compatible with other VMs.  My pet favorite kernel extension is persistence.
