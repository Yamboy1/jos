<br>&nbsp;
<a NAME=ART4 /A>
<h4>
<! page="">ARTICLE</a> IV Voting</h4>
4.1 At certain times it may be desirable for a vote to be called amongst
members to make decisions on important issues.
</p><p>
<p>4.2 Voting issues shall be classified as "ordinary" and "extraordinary".
"Extraordinary" votes shall be reserved for changes to the Constitution.
All other issues shall be decided by "ordinary" votes.
</p><p>
<p>4.3 A vote may be called by any voting member. If a voting member
wishes to call a vote then this shall be advertised for a minimum number
of  days prior to the start of the vote in the manner described in the
policy book. The minimum number of days shall be 7 for "ordinary" votes
and 14 for "extraordinary" votes. The advertisement shall specify one
member who has agreed to second the vote and a member who has agreed
to act as a neutral administrator of the vote. The advertisement shall
also specify the proposed wording of the question to be asked in the vote.
</p><p>
<p>4.4 As a result of a vote advertisement any member may object to the
choice of a vote administrator at any time before the start of the vote.
An objection should be made by contacting the proposer of the vote and
informing them of the objection. In the event of an objection the vote
proposer can either withdraw the vote, or select a new administrator. In
the latter case, the proposer shall place a new vote advertisement in
accordance with paragraph 4.3 In addition, the proposer of a vote may
withdraw his proposal without prejudice at any time prior to the beginning
of vote tabulation by the administrator. Once vote tabulation has begun,
no withdrawal request shall be entertained, and any vote result shall be
considered valid and binding, subject to the satisfaction of all other
voting criteria.
</p><p>
<p>4.5 It should be deemed a contravention of this constitution if any
member abuses paragraph 4.4 with the intention of preventing a vote from
taking place.
</p><p>
<p>4.6 Voting shall take place over a minimum period . This period
shall be 10 days for "ordinary" votes and 20 days for "extraordinary" votes.
Each member has a single vote, although it is permissible for a member
to change their minds about a vote within the voting period. Changes in
votes shall be corroborated by the vote adminstrator in the manner prescribed
in the policy book.
</p><p>
<p>4.7 Voting shall be secret. At no time during the voting period shall
preliminary results be advertised. Explanations for abstention are subject to publication when the final results are advertised, but the identity of the voter shall remain anonymous.  The voting procedure is detailed in
the policy book.
</p><p>
<p>4.8 It is the responsibility of the vote administrator to make a reasonable
attempt to advertise the results of the vote to the "JOS" membership within
3 days of the closure of the vote. Details of what is termed "reasonable"
are available within policy book. No vote shall be binding until the results
are successfully advertised.
</p><p>
<p>4.9 A vote is declared void if less than a quorum is reached. The
quorum shall be calculated as a percent of the number of members of the
voting information list. The quorum shall be 15% for "ordinary" votes and
25% for "extraordinary" votes. The procedure for tabulating the voting
information list membership and resulting quorums shall be detailed in
the policy book.
</p><p>
<p>4.10 Valid votes shall be one of the following: [a] Yes (approve the
proposal as stated) [b] No (disapprove the proposal as stated) [c] Neither
(neither approve or disapprove the proposal as stated) [d] Abstain with
explanation (no vote cast)
</p><p>
<p>4.11  A proposal is considered to have been approved if the appropriate
quorum was met and more than a minimum percent of votes cast were "yes"
votes. A proposal is said to have been rejected if the appropriate quorum
was met and more than a minimum percent of votes cast were "no" votes.
A proposal is considered to have failed to pass without prejudice if neither
"yes" nor "no" options reached the minimum percent of votes cast or if
the appropriate quorum was not met. The minimum percent of votes cast for
approval or rejection shall be 50% for "ordinary" votes and 66% for "extraordinary"
votes.
