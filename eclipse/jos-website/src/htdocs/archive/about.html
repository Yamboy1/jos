<h1>About</h1>
<p>This is an overview of the JOS Project. If you are
new to the JOS project, this is the right place to start. Here is
an overview of the project, infrastructure and rules.</p>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The <strong>JOS Project</strong> is a
collaborative undertaking by an international group of Java&#153; programmers
and enthusiasts aimed at the creation of a free and open Java&#153; based
Operating System (JOS). As a collaborative effort, we work
together to research how a Java-based operating system
should work. Together, we work to build components for a
Java-based operating system. We encourage free license and
open source software for APIs, frameworks, tools and sister
projects. Whenever possible, actual software demonstrates the
mechanisms we recommend and alternatives we have
discovered.</p>

<p>Many of the platform-independent operating system
utilities are compatible with existing operating systems so you
can take the software for a test drive. Our members are using
Linux and Microsoft Windows&#153; to developing these
components. Some of the APIs and frameworks are already
production-quality code and can be integrate into your Java
applications today.</p>

<h4>Research continues.</h4>
<p>Research is now divided into many independent research
projects. For mechanisms related to the
development of an operating system, search for an individual
project.</p>

<p>Early on, our approach to a Java Operating System had been to
centralize all research in one giant project. This monolithic
approach has proved disappointing. A successful research project
must limit its scope and maintain its focus.
One giant project is neither advisable nor necessary.
It is not advisable because of size complicates logistics.
A Java Operating System is a very big responsibility
and requires many pre-existing, loosely-coupled mechanisms.
It is not necessary because each mechanism can be researched
independently, <em>and should be</em>.</p>

<h4>Infrastructure</h4>
<P>As an international group, we depend heavily
on the Internet, e-mail and the jos-general mailing list to keep in
touch.</P>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mailing list.</strong> The jos-general
<a href="http://jos.sourceforge.net/view//MailingList">mailing list</a>
is our primary channel, a forum for public discussion
and decision-making.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>JOS Wiki.</strong> The JOS Wiki website
is part of our project infrastructure. It provides more than
2000 articles on different topics. Some article review topics
which have already been discussed on our mailing list. Other
articles contain proposals, reference material and product
information.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> The wiki technology enabled our members to
write articles on a wide variety of topics with a consistent
design. <!--  Join our wiki and you can write HTML pages using nothing more than
your favorite HTML browser. --> For more information, see also
<a href="http://jos.sourceforge.net/html/JosWikiStatus.html"> Jos Wiki Status</a></p></li>

<li><p><strong>SourceForge.net</strong> Websites,
for our project and many of our sister projects, are hosted on
the Internet by
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge.net</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<H4>Rules</H4>
<P>Members of the JOS Project are guided by only a few
basic rules of conduct. For more information, see also our
<A HREF="../constitution.html">constitution</A> and
proposed <A HREF="../policybook.html">policy book</A>.
If you are new to the JOS project, visit the
<A HREF="http://jos.sourceforge.net/">WebHome</A>
of the JOS Wiki (our online
collaboration area). There you will find a list of starting points for learning
about the JOS project. </P>
