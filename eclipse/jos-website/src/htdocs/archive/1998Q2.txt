OVERVIEW
~~~~~~~~

The JOS Project(tm) is a collaborative undertaking by an
international group of programmers and enthusiasts aimed at
the creation of a free and open Java(tm) based operating system.


The JOS Project had a good second quarter growth rate with
over 800 hours donated by experienced architects and
programmers.  Project hours were spent focusing on
infrastructure, analysis, design and implementation.

JOS is a ground floor opportunity for dedicated, creative
individuals interested in impacting the software world.


MAJOR ITEMS
~~~~~~~~~~~

Constitution:

We now have a consitution which will allow us to make
offical decision in the future.  It was approved by a
majority of the people on the primary lists and is
awaiting for a mailing list for voting procedure.

PROJECT SUMMARIES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A) JDK WORK

Peter Onyisi: The JDK 1.2 java.util package is roughly 70% complete.
FredrikGrohn: Zip/Jar Deflate 40% complete.

B) KERNEL DRIVER INTERFACE

RobertFitzsimons: The Kernel/Driver Interface is a minimal set
of functions to allow for a platform independent VM.  So if JOS
is to be ported to a different platform the porter just has
to implement functions and write a few drivers.  At the
moment I am working on a implementation of the Kernel/Driver
Interface on top of Linux.  I'm also looking at writting our
own VM for JOS.

C) MISCELEANOUS

Matthew Caswell: TCP/IP Stack beginning
Stefan Borg: AlterKit, and oStore and object storage utility.
Tim Metzler: Cron Daemon and Daemon Runner
Linus Larsson: JOSHttpDaemon, DocSet.


THIRD QUARTER GOALS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kernel - Get a development image competed for download.

Applications - More applications are on the way.

Organization - Eric Griffin is working on a formalized
proposal / specification / implementation process to
complement our bazzar process.
